      "Gen Z: Genesis 11. In the very start, God made the sky and the earth. 2. So basically, at first, the earth was a hot mess. It didn't have any structure or anything, just emptiness and darkness all around. But then, the Spirit of God started doing its thing, cruising over the oceans. 3. Then God was like, 'Yo, let there be light,' and boom, there was light. 4. And God was like, 'Yo, this light is lit!' So, God separated the light from the darkness. Like, He made sure they don't mix, you know? 5. So, like, God named the light as Day and the darkness as Night. And, you know, that whole cycle of evening and morning, it marked the first day. It's like, just to clarify, the evening came, and then the morning came, and that's how the first day went down. 6. And God was like, yo, there should be, like, this cool layer between the water, separating it from more water. And like, this layer is actually called the 'expansion'. 7. And then God created, like, this super cool, massive sky thing, and He split up the water below it from the water above it. And guess what? It totally happened, just like that! 8. So God named the sky Heaven. And it became the second day after the evening and morning passed. {And the evening...: Hebrew text clarifies that the evening came and the morning came, marking a new day.} 9. And God was like, yo, let's bring all the water together in one place and make some solid ground, and just like that, it happened. 10. And God was like, 'Yo, let's name that solid ground Earth,' and the whole watery party He called Seas. And you know what? God thought it was all pretty lit. 11. And God was all like, yo, let the earth do its thing and grow some sick grass, and some dope herbs that bring forth seeds, and also some lit fruit trees that produce fruit after their kind, with seeds in themselves, all up in the earth. And guess what? Boom! It happened, just like that. (By the way, 'grass' in Hebrew means some really fresh and tender grass, just FYI.) 12. And then, like, the earth totally grew some awesome grass and plants that had seeds of their own. Oh, and there were these cool trees that grew yummy fruits with seeds too! And God was like, 'Yo, that's super good!' 13. So, like, the third day came to an end and a new day began. It's like, you know, the evening turned into morning. Just to clarify, when I say 'evening' I mean the start of the day and when I say 'morning' I mean the end of the day, you feel me? 14. And God was like, 'Yo, we need some lights up in the sky to separate the day from the night. They'll be there as signs and to mark the seasons, days, and years, ya know? It's like the perfect balance between day and night! 15. And, like, God made these things called stars and stuff in the sky to, like, give light to the earth. And, bro, it totally happened. No lie. 16. And God created two awesome sources of light: one super bright light to be in charge of the day, and another not-so-bright light to be in charge of the night. Oh, and He also made all those cool stars! #dayandnightvibes 17. Yo, God placed those celestial bodies up in the sky to illuminate the earth. 18. And like, to have power over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God was like, 'Yo, that's lit!' 19. And then there was the fourth day, with its evening and morning. You know, like when the sun sets and then rises again. Pretty cool, right? (By the way, the Hebrew version says basically the same thing but in a different way, just so you know) 20. And God was like, yo, it's time for the waters to be filled with all sorts of dope creatures that have life, and birds that can soar high up in the sky, in that wide-open space above the earth. By the way, when I say 'moving creatures,' I mean the ones that crawl or whatever. And when I say lifee,' I mean those creatures with souls. And when I say 'birds,' I mean the ones that are good at flying. And when I say 'wide-open space,' I mean the face of that cool firmament in the sky. 21. And yo, God made these dope whales and every livin' creature that be movin', which be poppin' outta the waters in mad numbers, each one accord'n to its kind, and all them flyin' birds accord'n to their kind too: and God peeped that it was all good, ya heard? 22. And God was like, yo fam, I got you! Blessing all of y'all, He was like, go forth and prosper, make yourselves  fruitful and multiply like crazy, dominate the oceans with all kinds of fish, and let the birds go wild and multiply all over the land. 23. And like, the evening and the morning vibes were totally on point, it was the lit fifth day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.} 24. And God was like, 'Yo, earth! Time to bring out the living creatures, like, each one according to their own kind: cattle, creepy crawlies, and all the beasts of the land.' And guess what? It totally happened, just like that. 25. And God created all the animals on the earth, like, totally each according to its own kind, you know? The wild beasts, the farm animals, and even all the creeping things, all unique and special in their own way. And when God looked at everything He made, He was like, 'That's good, man!' 26. Yo, God was like, 'Check it, let's make humans look and act like us, and let them be in charge of the fish in the ocean, the birds in the sky, all the animals on land, and everything that crawls on the ground.' 27. God was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna make humans just like me, you know? So he made them in his image. And get this, he made them both male and female. Double the awesomeness! 28. And God straight up blessed them, and He was all like, 'Yo, be productive and reproduce like crazy, and fill up the earth with your peeps. Oh, and you got the power to control the fish in the sea, birds in the sky, and basically any living thing that's roaming around. You got this!' 29. Yo, peep this: God's like, 'Check it, I hooked you up with all the plants that have seeds on the planet, and every tree with fruit that has seeds too. You can eat 'em all, they're your grub. For real! 30. And I made sure that all the animals on the earth, birds in the sky, and every living creature that crawls on the ground had plenty of green plants to eat. They all depended on it for survival, and that's exactly what happened. (By the way, when I say 'living creatures' I mean beings with a soul – pretty cool, huh?) 31. And God looked at everything he created, and wow, it was totally awesome! And then the day turned into night and then back to morning, completing the sixth day.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 11. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 2. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness {was} upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 3. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 4. And God saw the light, that {it was} good: and God divided the light from the darkness. {the light from...: Heb. between the light and between the darkness} 5. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.} 6. And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. {firmament: Heb. expansion} 7. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which {were} under the firmament from the waters which {were} above the firmament: and it was so. 8. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.} 9. And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry {land} appear: and it was so. 10. And God called the dry {land} Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that {it was} good. 11. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, {and} the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed {is} in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. {grass: Heb. tender grass} 12. And the earth brought forth grass, {and} herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed {was} in itself, after his kind: and God saw that {it was} good. 13. And the evening and the morning were the third day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.} 14. And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: {the day...: Heb. between the day and between the night} 15. And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 16. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: {he made} the stars also. {to rule the day...: Heb. for the rule of the day, etc.} 17. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, 18. And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that {it was} good. 19. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.} 20. And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl {that} may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. {moving: or, creeping} {life: Heb. soul} {fowl...: Heb. let fowl fly} {open...: Heb. face of the firmament of heaven} 21. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that {it was} good. 22. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 23. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.} 24. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. 25. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that {it was} good. 26. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 27. So God created man in his {own} image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. {moveth: Heb. creepeth} 29. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which {is} upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which {is} the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. {bearing...: Heb. seeding seed} {yielding...: Heb. seeding seed} 30. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein {there is} life, {I have given} every green herb for meat: and it was so. {life: Heb. a living soul} 31. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, {it was} very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.} \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 21. So, like, the sky and the earth were totally done being created, and everything that lives in them, you know? 2. And like after finishing his epic creation, God was just like, 'Yo, I'm done.' So on the seventh day, he decided it was time to chill and take a break from all the hard work he put in. 3. And God was like, 'Yo, the seventh day is lit af!' He blessed it and made it holy because He finally took a break from all the work He did in creating and making everything. 4. So, like, this is, like, the story of how the sky and the earth were made, ya know? It all happened way back in the day when the LORD God made everything, like the earth and the heavens. 5. And before all the plants and herbs of the field could grow, before they even existed, God had not made it rain on the earth and there weren't any humans to take care of the land. 6. Then a mist rose from the earth and watered the entire surface of the ground. 7. God created the first person by shaping them from the dirt and breathing life into their nose. That's how they became a living being. 8. So, like, God created this super rad garden in Eden and placed the dude He had made right there, to the east. 9. Then God, like, totally grew all these awesome trees from the ground that are, like, super pleasing to look at and great for munching on. There was even this one tree called the tree of life right in the middle of the garden, and another one called the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 10. So, like, there was this totally rad river flowing out of Eden to water the garden. And then, it, like, split into four different streams, covering the whole place. 11. The first spot is called Pison, and it's the area all around Havilah. You know, that place where they find lots of gold. 12. The gold over there is legit amazing: they've got bdellium and onyx stones too. 13. The second river is called Gihon—it's the one that flows all around the land of Ethiopia. (Ethiopia is also known as Cush, by the way.) 14. The third river is called Hiddekel, and it flows towards the east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates. 15. Then God, yo, took the homie and dropped him in the Garden of Eden to work on that greenery and keep it in check. The homie being Adam, you know what I'm saying? 16. So, like, God was straight up telling the dude, 'Yo, you can totally munch on any tree in the garden, like for real, go ahead and feast on all of it!' 17. Yo, don't mess with that tree that's all about knowing good and evil. If you go ahead and eat from it, trust me, you're gonna be in major trouble. Like, you'll literally be doomed to die on the day you take a bite. 18. Yo, the LORD God was like, it's not cool for this dude to be all by himself. I got his back though, I'm gonna create a perfect partner for him. 19. So, like, God created all the animals on the earth and in the sky, yo. And then He took them to Adam to see what he would name them, you know? And whatever names Adam gave them, that was their official name, man. (Adam could also mean the man, just saying.) 20. So, Adam was like, naming all the animals, the birds, and every wild creature out there. But, he couldn't find a suitable companion for himself. 21. So, God made Adam super tired and he fell into a really deep sleep. While he was snoozing, God took out one of his ribs and patched up the spot with flesh. 22. Then God took one of Adam's ribs and used it to create a woman, whom He brought to Adam. 23. Adam was like, 'Yo, this girl is straight-up a part of me. She's made from my own bones and flesh, so let's call her Woman, 'cause she came from Man.' (In Hebrew, Woman is Isha, and Man is Ish.) 24. So basically, when a dude grows up, he's gonna bounce from his parents and hang tight with his wifey. And let me tell you, they gonna be super connected, like they a single unit. 25. So like, the man and his wife were totally without clothes, and they were cool with it, no shame or anything.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 21. Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. 2. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. 3. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. {created...: Heb. created to make} 4. These {are} the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens, 5. And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and {there was} not a man to till the ground. 6. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. {there...: or, a mist which went up from, etc.} 7. And the LORD God formed man {of} the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. {of the dust...: Heb. dust of the ground} 8. And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. 9. And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. 10. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. 11. The name of the first {is} Pison: that {is} it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where {there is} gold; 12. And the gold of that land {is} good: there {is} bdellium and the onyx stone. 13. And the name of the second river {is} Gihon: the same {is} it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. {Ethiopia: Heb. Cush} 14. And the name of the third river {is} Hiddekel: that {is} it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river {is} Euphrates. {toward...: or, eastward to Assyria} 15. And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. {the man: or, Adam} 16. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: {thou...: Heb. eating thou shalt eat} 17. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. {thou shalt surely...: Heb. dying thou shalt die} 18. And the LORD God said, {It is} not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. {meet...: Heb. as before him} 19. And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought {them} unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that {was} the name thereof. {Adam: or, the man} 20. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. {gave: Heb. called} 21. And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; 22. And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. {made: Heb. builded} 23. And Adam said, This {is} now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. {Woman: Heb. Isha} {Man: Heb. Ish} 24. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. 25. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 31. So, this snake, right, it was like super sneaky compared to all the other animals that God created in the field. And it goes up to the woman and says, 'Hey, did God really say you can't eat from any tree in the garden? Like, seriously?' 2. The woman was like, 'Yo, Mr. Snake, we can totally chow down on any of the fruit from these wicked cool trees in the garden! 🍎🌳' 3. But like, there's this tree in the garden, and God's like, 'Don't eat from it or even touch it, or you're toast.'\" } 4. And the serpent was like, 'Nah, girl, you ain't gonna die for real:' 5. God knows that once you eat it, your eyes will be opened and you'll be able to understand good and evil, feeling a lot more enlightened, like gods. 6. So, the woman looked at the tree and saw that it had delicious food on it and looked really nice. Plus, she thought it would make her wise. She couldn't resist, so she took a bite from its fruit and shared it with her husband. And guess what? He took a bite too. 7. Then both of them suddenly became aware that they were naked. So, they quickly stitched together some fig leaves and fashioned them into cover-ups. 8. And they totally heard God's voice strolling through the garden, like chillaxing in the afternoon breeze. And Adam and his wifey were like, 'OMG, we gotta hide from the Almighty!' So they went all ninja mode, camouflaging themselves amongst the trees. BTW, 'cool' in Hebrew means 'wind'. No biggie. 9. God hollers at Adam like, 'Yo, where you at, bro? 10. And he was like, yo, I heard you calling out in the garden and I got hella scared because I realized I was naked, so I straight up hid myself. 11. And God was like, 'Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree even though I told you not to?'\"}\n",
      " 12. So the guy was like, 'Yo, God, it's not my fault! That chick you gave me, she made me eat from the tree!' 13. So, like, the Lord God was all like, yo woman, what's up with what you just did? And the woman was like, the snake tricked me, and I couldn't resist, and I ended up eating the thing. 14. And like, God was all like, 'Yo, serpent! Since you pulled that shady move, you're straight-up cursed more than any other animal out there. You'll be crawling on your belly and munching on dirt for the rest of your days, no joke.' 15. And I will make things real tough between you and the woman, and between your crew and her crew; someone's gonna knock you down hard, but you'll manage to hurt them a bit too. 16. To the woman, He said, 'I know things are going to get tough for you when it comes to giving birth and raising kids. It's gonna be a struggle, but your love and dedication will be towards your husband, and he will take the lead in your relationship. {'Subject to your husband' is another way to put it.}\" } 17. And God was like, 'Adam, bro, 'cause you listened to your wife and ate from that tree after I specifically told you not to, the ground is totally cursed now. You're gonna have to work super hard and deal with a lot of pain and struggle just to get food for the rest of your life, man. 18. It's gonna be rough when it comes to growing stuff, you'll have to deal with thorns and thistles. And hey, forget about gourmet meals – you'll be feasting on plain ol' grass from the field. 🌱 19. You're gonna have to work hard to put food on the table, until the day you die and become one with the earth again. 'Cause hey, we all came from dust, and back to dust we go. 20. And Adam gave his wife the name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. {Eve: in Hebrew, her name is Chavah, which means Living} 21. Then God hooked Adam and his wife up with some fresh animal skin drip. 22. Yo, God was like, check it, man has leveled up and is now vibing on our wavelength, knowing what's good and what's not. But hold up, if he goes ahead and snags some of that tree of life and chows down, he gonna live forever. Can't have that, tho. 23. So, like, God was like 'bye' and kicked him out of the garden of Eden to go farming, which is where he came from in the first place. 24. Then he kicked the guy out and put these angelic beings with flaming swords on the east side of the garden, guarding the path to the tree that gives everlasting life.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 31. Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? {Yea...: Heb. Yea, because, etc.} 2. And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: 3. But of the fruit of the tree which {is} in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 4. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 5. For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 6. And when the woman saw that the tree {was} good for food, and that it {was} pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make {one} wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. {pleasant: Heb. a desire} 7. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they {were} naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. {aprons: or, things to gird about} 8. And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. {cool: Heb. wind} 9. And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where {art} thou? 10. And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I {was} naked; and I hid myself. 11. And he said, Who told thee that thou {wast} naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat? 12. And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest {to be} with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat. 13. And the LORD God said unto the woman, What {is} this {that} thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. 14. And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou {art} cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: 15. And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. 16. Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire {shall be} to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. {to thy...: or, subject to thy husband} 17. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed {is} the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat {of} it all the days of thy life; 18. Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; {bring...: Heb. cause to bud} 19. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou {art}, and unto dust shalt thou return. 20. And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. {Eve: Heb. Chavah: that is Living} 21. Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them. 22. And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 23. Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken. 24. So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 41. Adam and Eve did the deed, and she got pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, 'I've acquired a man with God's help.' (Cain means 'gotten' or 'acquired') 2. Then she gave birth to another boy named Abel. Abel took care of sheep, while Cain worked as a farmer. (Abel means 'breath' in Hebrew. 'A keeper' means 'a feeder' in Hebrew.) 3. After a while, Cain decided to bring an offering to the LORD. He brought some fruits from the ground as his offering. 4. Abel rolled up with some top-notch sheep and some prime fat from his flock. And man, the big man upstairs was totally feeling it. He showed mad love to Abel and his offering. 5. But God did not approve of Cain and his offering. This made Cain really angry and upset. 6. And God was like, 'Dude, why you so pissed? What's up with that gloomy face of yours?' 7. Yo, if you're doing things right, won't you be accepted? But if you're not, sin is hanging out, ready to trip you up. And you, my friend, have the power to rule over it. #Respect 8. So, Cain and Abel were having a convo, you know, just chillin' in the field. And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, Cain straight up attacked Abel and, unfortunately, killed him. 9. And God was like, 'Hey Cain, where's your brother Abel?' And Cain was like, 'IDK man, am I supposed to be responsible for him?' 10. And God was like, 'Dude, what did you do? Your brother's blood is literally calling out to me from the ground. It's like a super intense cry for justice, you know? #bloods 11. And now, it's like a major bummer, but the earth is totally not vibing with you anymore. It opened up and took in your bro's blood after you messed up big time. 12. When you work the land, it won't produce its harvest for you anymore. You'll wander the earth as a lost soul, forever on the run. 13. Cain was like, Godd, this punishment you're giving me is just too much for me to handle. My mistakes are so heavy, it feels like they can't be forgiven.'\" } 14. Yo, check it. Today, you've totally kicked me outta this place and now I won't be able to see you anymore. I'm gonna be like a wanderer without a home, just roaming around. And guess what? Anyone who crosses paths with me is gonna wanna take me out. 15. Then God said to him, look, if anyone kills Cain, they will face seven times the punishment. So God marked Cain to protect him from anyone who might harm him. 16. So Cain bounced out of God's sight and settled down in this cool place called Nod, over yonder east of Eden. 17. So Cain and his wife got together and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son named Enoch. Then Cain went on to build a city and named it after his son, Enoch. 18. And then Enoch became a father to Irad, who later had a son named Mehujael. Mehujael in turn had a son named Methusael, and Methusael was the father of Lamech. (Note: Lamech is the same as Lemech in Hebrew.) 19. Lamech was totally down with having two wives - one called Adah and the other called Zillah. 20. And Adah gave birth to Jabal: he was like the OG dad of those who live in tents and have cattle. 21. Jubal, the dude's brother, was all about those sick tunes. He was like, the OG who started the whole harp and organ trend. 22. And Zillah also had Tubalcain, who was known for his skills in working with brass and iron. Tubalcain's sister was named Naamah. (Whetter means someone who sharpens tools) 23. Lamech was like, 'Listen up, Adah and Zillah, my badass wives! Pay attention to what I'm saying: I totally messed up by killing a dude, and it's seriously messing with me. It's like I hurt myself by attacking this young guy. It's messed up, man.' 24. If someone messes with Cain and gets seven times the punishment, then just imagine how intense it'll be for anyone who messes with Lamech, 'cause he's gonna bring it seventy-seven times harder. 25. And Adam got to know his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth. She said, Godd has given me another child to replace Abel, whom Cain killed.' (Seth means 'appointed' or 'put' in Hebrew.) 26. And Seth had a son named Enos, which means human. It was around this time that people started connecting with the divine and seeking guidance from the LORD.\"} \n",

And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. {in process...: Heb. at the end of days} 4. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: {flock: Heb. sheep, or, goats} 5. But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. 6. And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen? 7. If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee {shall be} his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. {be accepted: or, have the excellency} {unto...: or, subject unto thee} 8.

Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, {that} every one that findeth me shall slay me. 15. And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him. 16. And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden. 17. And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch. {Enoch: Heb. Chanoch} 18. And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech. {Lamech: Heb. Lemech} 19. And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one {was} Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 20. And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and {of such as have} cattle. 21. And his brother's name {was} Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ. 22. And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain {was} Naamah. {instructer: Heb. whetter} 23.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 51. Yo, this is the story of Adam and his fam. When God made humans, He made 'em in His own image, yo. 2. God made them male and female, and gave them His blessing. He called them Adam when He created them. 3. And Adam reached the age of 130 and had a child who was just like him and looked just like him. He named him Seth.  4. After Adam had Seth, he went on to live a whopping eight hundred years and had lots of sons and daughters, no cap! 5. So like, Adam was around for a solid 930 years before he passed away. Like, he lived a looong time, but eventually, his time just came to an end. 6. And Seth lived to be 105 years old, and became the father of Enos: (Enos means Enosh in Hebrew) 7. Seth lived for a long time, about 807 years after he had a kid named Enos. During those years, he had lots of sons and daughters. 8. Seth lived for a solid 912 years and then kicked the bucket. 9. Enos was around for a solid ninety years and then became the proud parent of Cainan, also known as Kenan. 10. And Enos, like, lived for eight hundred and fifteen years after he had Cainan, and he also had sons and daughters, you know? 11. Enos was alive for a really long time, like 905 years, and then he passed away. 12. And Cainan was around for like seventy years, and then he had a kid named Mahalaleel. (P.S. Mahalaleel is sometimes referred to as Maleleel in Greek.) 13. And Cainan lived for, like, eight hundred and forty more years after he had Mahalaleel. During that time, he also had a bunch of sons and daughters. 14. Cainan lived a solid 910 years, then he passed on. 15. And Mahalaleel was alive for 65 years and became the father of Jared. 16. And Mahalaleel lived for another 830 years after he had Jared, and had many sons and daughters. 17. And Mahalaleel lived for 895 years, and then he passed away. 18. So Jared was around for 162 years, and then he became the father of Enoch: 19. And Jared lived for a whopping 800 years after becoming a dad to Enoch. During that time, he also had a bunch of sons and daughters. 20. And Jared lived for a cool 962 years before he passed away. 21. So yeah, Enoch was around for 65 years and then he became a dad to Methuselah (btw, he's also known as Mathusala in Greek). 22. And Enoch was all about that quality time with God, for a solid three hundred years after he became a dad to Methuselah. Oh, and he also went ahead and had a bunch of sons and daughters, too! 23. And Enoch lived for a total of 365 years. 24. And Enoch was tight with God, like they were always homies, and then one day he just disappeared. God straight up scooped him up. 25. And Methuselah was alive for 187 years, and then had a child named Lamech: 26. And Methuselah kept on living for a super long time, like 782 years, after he became a dad to Lamech. He also had a bunch of other kids, too! 27. And Methuselah lived for a whopping 969 years before he passed on. 28. And Lamech, he lived for like 182 years, and then he became a dad and had a son. 29. Then he named him Noah, which means 'rest' or 'comfort' in Greek, saying, 'This guy is gonna bring us some relief from all the hard work and sweat we put into our jobs, because of the ground that God cursed.' 30. And Lamech was around for a solid 595 years after he became a dad to Noah. During that time, he also had some other kids, both boys and girls. Such a long and blessed life! 31. And Lamech lived for a pretty epic 777 years before he passed away. 32. Noah was like 500 years old when he became a dad to Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Can you believe it?!\"} \n",

      "Gen Z: Genesis 61. So, like, it happened when more and more people started coming around on this planet, and these guys started having daughters, you know? 2. So, like, the heavenly dudes noticed how gorgeous the human gals were, and they decided to marry them, like whoever they wanted. 3. And God was like, I can't deal with humans forever, 'cause they're just so human, you know? But I'll give them, like, 120 years to figure it out. 4. Back in the day, there were some seriously massive humans on the earth. And even later, when these gods-like dudes hooked up with mortal ladies and had kids with them, those kids turned out to be super powerful and well-known. 5. And OMG, God looked down on the Earth and was like, 'Yo, humans are straight up wicked AF. Like, literally everything they think about is evil, without a break. And I mean, not just their thoughts, but also their desires and plans.' And this isn't just a one-time thing, it's like an everyday occurrence. 6. God was so bummed and regretted creating humans on earth. It really broke His heart. 7. And God was like, 'Yo, I'm pretty bummed out about creating humans and animals and stuff. I think I'm gonna wipe them all out from the face of the earth.' 8. But Noah was totally favored by the LORD. 9. This is the story of Noah's fam: Noah was a righteous dude who kept it real, not just for himself, but for his peeps too. He had a tight connection with God, always keeping it on point. (Just so you know, 'perfect' here means upright, not flawless, ya know?) 10. And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. They were the real OGs of Noah's fam. 11. Yo, the earth was totally messed up in God's eyes, like for real. It was all kinds of messed up and violence was everywhere. 12. And God checked out the earth, and like, woah, it was messed up; 'cause everyone had messed up their way of living on the earth. 13. God told Noah, 'I'm seeing how messed up everything has become, with all the violence happening. It's too much. I'm gonna wipe them all out, along with the whole earth.' 14. Okay, so here's the deal: build yourself a really cool ark out of gopher wood. And get this, you gotta make some rooms inside the ark, comfy ones! Now, here comes the important part - you gotta totally seal that bad boy inside and out with some pitch. You know, that sticky stuff. Oh, and by the way, when it says 'rooms,' it actually means 'nests' in Hebrew. Just a fun fact for ya! 15. And here's the deal for building that ark: It's gonna be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits tall, just like that. 16. Yo, make a window on the ark, and make it like a cubit above; and place the door of the ark on its side. And you gotta build it with three levels: lower, second, and third. 17. Yo, listen up! I'm about to bring down a massive flood on the whole earth. It's gonna wipe out all living creatures that have the breath of life in 'em, everything on this planet is gonna die. 18. But I'm gonna make a deal with you, and you and your squad will hop on the ark - you, your sons, your wifey, and your sons' baes. We're in this together fam! 19. And you gotta bring two of every different kind of living thing into the ark, so they can stay alive with you. They gotta be a guy and a girl. 20. Yo, you're gonna have all kinds of birds, animals, and creepy crawlies pullin' up, representing their own kind. They're comin' in pairs, man, to make sure they stay alive and kickin'. 21. Yo, grab some of every kind of food that people eat and stash it, it's gonna be your food and their food too. 22. Noah totally came through, doing everything God told him to do, no questions asked. He was totally on point!\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 61. And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 2. That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they {were} fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. 3. And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also {is} flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. 4. There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare {children} to them, the same {became} mighty men which {were} of old, men of renown. 5. And GOD saw that the wickedness of man {was} great in the earth, and {that} every imagination of the thoughts of his heart {was} only evil continually. {every...: or, the whole imagination: the Hebrew word signifieth not only the imagination, but also the purposes and desires} {continually: Heb. every day} 6. And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. 7. And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them. {both...: Heb. from man unto beast} 8. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. 9. These {are} the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man {and} perfect in his generations, {and} Noah walked with God. {perfect: or, upright} 10. And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11. The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12. And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth. 13. And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth. {with the earth: or, from the earth} 14. Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. {rooms: Heb. nests} 15. And this {is the fashion} which thou shalt make it {of}: The length of the ark {shall be} three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. 16. A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; {with} lower, second, and third {stories} shalt thou make it. 17. And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein {is} the breath of life, from under heaven; {and} every thing that {is} in the earth shall die. 18. But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. 19. And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every {sort} shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep {them} alive with thee; they shall be male and female. 20. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every {sort} shall come unto thee, to keep {them} alive. 21. And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather {it} to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 22. Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 71. And God was like, 'Yo Noah, it's time to gather up your whole fam and slide into this ark. You've been keeping it real with me and staying righteous while everyone else is losing their way. 2. Yo, you gotta gather up seven of each clean animal, the male and its female. And for the unclean animals, just take two, the male and its female. (By the way, when it says 'by sevens' in Hebrew, it means 'seven seven'.) 3. So, like, God was like, 'Yo, birds in the sky, come on, two of each gender, but like, also seven pairs, just to, you know, keep the whole bird population going strong across the entire earth, ya feel? Oh, and by the way, 'seven seven' in Hebrew basically means 'a lot, a lot.'\" } 4. Listen up fam, in just one week, Imma make it rain for 40 straight days and nights. And let me tell you, everything that's alive that I've created? It's all gonna be wiped out, deleted, gone from the face of this earth. No more, gonezo. #blotout 5. So Noah basically did exactly what the LORD told him to do, no questions asked. 6. Noah was, like, totally six hundred years old when the big flood happened and covered the whole earth with water. Can you believe that? 7. So Noah and his squad, including his wife and his sons' baez, all went into the ark to escape the massive flood waters. 8. All types of animals, whether they're considered clean or not, and birds, and every living creature that crawls on the ground, 9. Then two by two, both the guys and the girls, went into the ark to chill with Noah, just like how God told him to do. 10. So, like, after a whole week, it happened - the floodwater came rushing onto the earth. 11. When Noah was six hundred years old, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, something amazing happened. The mighty deep burst open all at once, and the gates of heaven were wide open too. Wow, what a sight! 12. So, like, it rained nonstop for a whole forty days and nights. 13. On that very day, Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth—the sons of Noah—along with Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons, all entered the ark together. 14. So, like, all the animals and stuff, each according to their own kind, and all the cattle, and every kind of creepy crawling thing on the earth, also according to their kind, and all the birds, like, every type of bird, you know, with all their different wings and stuff. #diversity 15. And all the animals entered the ark, two by two, to be with Noah. This included every living creature, with the breath of life within them. 16. And all the different kinds of animals, with both males and females, entered the ark just as God had told Noah. Then the LORD closed the door behind them. 17. So, like, the flood lasted for a whole 40 days, you know? And the water kept rising and lifted up the ark, above the earth and stuff. 18. Then the water kept rising and grew a lot, covering the entire earth. The ark floated on the surface of the water. 19. So, like, the water totally took over the earth and, like, even the super tall hills everywhere were completely, like, underwater. 20. The water went up by fifteen cubits and even the mountains got submerged. 21. And, like, every living thing, ya know, like birds, animals, and bugs, and even humans, they all died. No joke. 22. Every living creature on land, with the breath of life in their nostrils, perished. They were all gone, from animals to humans, as their life force, the spirit within, left their bodies. 23. So like, everything on the earth got wiped out—like, all living things, humans and animals and the little creepy crawlies and birds in the sky—just gone. Poof! Except for Noah and those chillin' with him on the ark, they were the only ones left surviving, man. 24. And the water totally took over the whole earth for like a hundred and fifty days straight. It was intense, dude.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 71. And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation. 2. Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female: and of beasts that {are} not clean by two, the male and his female. {by sevens: Heb. seven seven} 3. Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth. {by sevens: Heb. seven seven} 4. For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth. {destroy: Heb. blot out} 5. And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him. 6. And Noah {was} six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth. 7. And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. 8. Of clean beasts, and of beasts that {are} not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth, 9. There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah. 10. And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth. {after...: or, on the seventh day} 11. In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened. {windows: or, floodgates} 12. And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights. 13. In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark; 14. They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort. {sort: Heb. wing} 15. And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein {is} the breath of life. 16. And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in. 17. And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth. 18. And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters. 19. And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high hills, that {were} under the whole heaven, were covered. 20. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered. 21. And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man: 22. All in whose nostrils {was} the breath of life, of all that {was} in the dry {land}, died. {the breath...: Heb. the breath of the spirit of life} 23. And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained {alive}, and they that {were} with him in the ark. 24. And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 81. And then God was like, 'Oh yeah, Noah and all the animals in the ark, I got you!' So God caused a cool breeze to blow over the earth, and the flood waters calmed down. 2. The huge water sources and the sky's openings got shut down, and the rainfall from above was held back. 3. And the waters kept going back and forth from the earth, non-stop. And after a hundred and fifty days, the waters started to calm down. 4. And the ark finally stopped in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day, up on the mountains of Ararat. 5. And the water kept on going down until the tenth month. Then, on the first day of that month, the tops of the mountains became visible. 6. So, after like 40 days, Noah was like, 'Yo, let's open this window on the ark he built.' 7. Then he let a raven out, which flew back and forth until the waters dried up from the earth. 8. So he let a dove go to see if the water had gone down from the ground. 9. But the dove couldn't find a chill spot for her foot, so she went back to the ark. The whole earth was filled with water, you know. Then, dude stretched out his hand, like totally reached out and brought her back into the ark. He made her come, ya know? 10. And after waiting another whole week, he sent the dove out of the ark once more. 11. Then, like, this dove flew back to Noah in the evening, and, whoa, in its mouth was a fresh olive leaf that it had picked! That's when Noah realized that the floodwaters had finally gone down. 12. Then he waited for another week and let the dove go; but this time, it didn't come back to him at all. 13. So, like, after six hundred and one years, in the first month and on the first day of the month, the waters like totally dried up from the earth. Then Noah uncovered the ark and peeped outside and, yo, the ground was all dry and stuff! 14. So, like, in the second month, on the 27th day, the earth finally dried up. 15. So basically, God started talking to Noah, like, 16. Alright, time to leave the ark! You, your spouse, your kids, and your kids' partners, come out with you. 17. Yo, take all the living creatures that are with you - every type of animal, bird, and crawling thing on the earth. Let them all come out and thrive, multiply and fill up the earth with their offspring. 18. So like, Noah and his fam - his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives - they all bounced together: 19. Every animal, every creature that crawls, and every bird, and whatever creeps upon the earth, according to their various species, came out of the ark. 20. So Noah made an altar for the LORD and brought some clean animals and clean birds to offer as burnt offerings on the altar. 21. God thought the smell was nice and said to himself, 'I won't curse the ground anymore because of people, even though they have evil thoughts from a young age. And I won't destroy all living things like I did before.' 22. As long as the earth's still kickin', we'll keep havin' those times to plant and harvest crops, experience both chilly and hot weather, go through summer and winter, and have day and night. It's not gonna stop anytime soon, trust me. {While...: Heb. Yo, this goes for all the days the earth's been here}\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 81. And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the cattle that {was} with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged; 2.

And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated. {continually: Heb. in going and returning} 4. And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat. 5.

Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; 9. But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters {were} on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. {pulled...: Heb. caused her to come} 10. And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; 11. And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth {was} an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 12. And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more. 13. And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first {month}, the first {day} of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry. 14. And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dried. 15. And God spake unto Noah, saying, 16. Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. 17. Bring forth with thee every living thing that {is} with thee, of all flesh, {both} of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. 18.

Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, {and} whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went forth out of the ark. {kinds: Heb. families} 20. And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 21. And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart {is} evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done. {a sweet...: Heb. a savour of rest or, satisfaction} {for the imagination: or, through the imagination} 22.

Every animal, bird, creature, and fish will look up to you with respect and a little bit of awe. They all know that you have dominion over them. It's like you have this cool superpower that lets you take charge of the whole animal kingdom! 3. You can chow down on any living creature, just like how I've given you the green herb to enjoy. 4. Don't munch on any meat that still has its life force, aka its blood. 5. Yo, I gotta make this clear: if someone takes a life - human or animal - I'm holding them accountable for it. Like, seriously, everyone's responsible for their own actions. No one can just go around harming others without facing the consequences. 6. If anyone takes a human's life, their own life should be taken, because every person is created in God's image. 7. Yo, go ahead and be productive, like, really go for it, and increase in numbers; bring forth plenty in the Earth and expand your influence there. 8. So, like, God started talking to Noah and his sons, and He was like, 9. And yo, check it, I'm making a solid pact with you and your future fam, no cap. 10. And also, don't forget about every living thing that's rollin' with you on this ride - birds, cows, and all the animals on land.

And I'll totally remember the promise I made to you and every living creature on this planet. Like, I promise there won't be another massive flood that wipes out all the living beings. 16. And there will be a rainbow in the sky; and I'll check it out to remember the never-ending promise between God and all the living creatures on earth. 17. And God was like, 'Yo Noah, this is the sign of the deal I made with all living creatures on earth.'\" } 18. So, after Noah and his family hopped off the ark, his sons were named Shem, Ham, and Japheth. And you know what? Ham became the dad of Canaan. (Just so you know, Canaan is also called Chenaan in Hebrew).\" } 19. So basically, Noah had three sons, and from them, the whole earth got filled up. 20. Noah started being into farming and decided to plant some vineyard: 21. And he, like, drank some wine and got wasted, and ended up not wearing clothes in his tent. 22. So Ham, Canaan's dad, accidentally saw his dad naked and told his two brothers about it. 23. So Shem and Japheth grabbed a cool hoodie, put it on together, and walked backward to cover their dad's exposed self. They made sure not to look so that their eyes wouldn't catch a glimpse. 24. And Noah woke up from his wine and realized what his younger son had done to him. 25. And he was like, Canaan is totally cursed, dude. He's gonna be, like, the ultimate servant to his brothers, man. 26. And he was like, yo, the LORD God of Shem is straight up blessed, and Canaan is gonna be his servant and everything. Canaan's gonna serve them real good, you feel me? 27. God's gonna hook Japheth up, and he'll be kickin' it in Shem's crib. Canaan gonna be workin' for him. 28.

Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things. 4. But flesh with the life thereof, {which is} the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 5. And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man. 6. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man. 7.

And with every living creature that {is} with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth. 11. And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth. 12. And God said, This {is} the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that {is} with you, for perpetual generations: 13.

And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid {it} upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces {were} backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. 24. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. 25. And he said, Cursed {be} Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. 26.

God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. {enlarge: or, persuade} 28. And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years. 29. And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 101. So here's the story of Noah's sons - Shem, Ham, and Japheth. They had some kids after the big flood happened. 2. The dudes from Japheth's line were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 3. And Gomer's sons were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 4. And Javan had some chill sons, like Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. (Some people call them Rodanim, but don't stress about it.) 5. So like, back in the day, the Gentiles had their own spots and territories. They would speak different languages and have their own family clans, you know, representing their nations. 6. And Ham had four sons named Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan. 7. And Cush had these sons: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabtecha. Then Raamah had two sons: Sheba and Dedan. 8. And Cush had a son named Nimrod, who quickly gained a reputation as a powerful figure among the people. 9. Nimrod was the ultimate hunter, impressing even the LORD Himself. That's why people say, Nimrod was the ultimate hunter in the eyes of the LORD. 10. So, like, the start of his kingdom was all about Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh. They were located in the land of Shinar, you know? Oh, and just to clarify, Babel is the same as Babylon in Greek. 11. Asshur left that place and founded cities like Nineveh, Rehoboth, and Calah in Assyria. These cities were bustling with streets and life! 12. And there's this awesome city called Resen, located right smack between Nineveh and Calah. It's seriously a happening place! 13. Mizraim had kids named Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, and Naphtuhim. 14. And there were Pathrusim, Casluhim (from whom the Philistines came), and Caphtorim. 15. And Canaan had a son named Sidon, who was his oldest, and also Heth. 16. And like, there were these people called Jebusites, Amorites, and Girgasites, 17. And there were also the Hivite, Arkite, and Sinite people, 18. And then you had the Arvadite crew, the Zemarite squad, and the Hamathite peeps. And after that, the Canaanites just multiplied and spread out all over the place, fam. 19. The Canaanites ruled a territory stretching from Sidon, all the way to Gerar and Gaza. As you journeyed, you'd pass through Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and finally Lasha. (Gaza was also called Azzah in Hebrew.) 20. These were the kids of Ham, representing their different backgrounds, languages, regions, and cultures. 21. So, like, Shem, who's like the dad of all the kids of Eber, you know? And he's, like, Japheth's older bro. And, yeah, Shem had his own kiddos too, just so you know. 22. The fam of Shem included Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram. (Arphaxad is also known as Arpachshad in Hebrew.) 23. And the descendants of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. 24. And Arphaxad had a son named Salah, and Salah had a son named Eber. (Salah means Shelah in Hebrew) 25. \"Yo, Eber had two sons: one called Peleg, because during his time, the earth got split up, and his bro was named Joktan. Peleg means 'division,' by the way.\" 26. And Joktan had three sons named Almodad, Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, as well as a son named Jerah. 27. And, like, Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah were also part of it, you know? 28. And like, Obal, Abimael, and Sheba, 29. And Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab were among the sons of Joktan. 30. And they stayed in Mesha, going all the way to Sephar in the eastern mountains. 31. So, like, these are the dudes from Shem’s fam, right? They had their own tribes and languages and lived all around the world, each with their own nation. 32. So basically, these are the fams of Noah's sons, generations later, in different nations. And yeah, the world got all split up after the flood, thanks to them.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 101. Now these {are} the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood. 2. The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 3. And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 4. And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. {Dodanim: or, as some read it, Rodanim} 5. By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations. 6. And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan. 7. And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan. 8. And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth. 9. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD. 10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. {Babel: Gr. Babylon} 11. Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, {went...: or, he went out into Assyria} {the city...: or, the streets of the city} 12. And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same {is} a great city. 13. And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 14. And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim. 15. And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, {Sidon: Heb. Tzidon} 16. And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite, 17. And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 18. And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 19. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha. {Gaza: Heb. Azzah} 20. These {are} the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, {and} in their nations. 21. Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were {children} born. 22. The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. {Arphaxad: Heb. Arpachshad} 23. And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 24. And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber. {Salah: Heb. Shelah} 25. And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one {was} Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name {was} Joktan. {Peleg: that is Division} 26. And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, 27. And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 28. And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 29. And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these {were} the sons of Joktan. 30. And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east. 31. These {are} the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations. 32. These {are} the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 111. At one time, everyone on the earth spoke the same language and communicated in the same way. (In Hebrew, they called it 'lip' and 'words'.) 2. So they were traveling from the east, and they stumbled upon a cool spot in the land of Shinar, where they decided to settle down. 3. And they were like, yo, check it, let's make some bricks and roast them real good. They swapped out stone for brick, and used slime as mortar, you feel me? 4. So they were like, 'Yo, let's build a sick city with a dope tower! It's gonna be so high, it could touch the heavens! And we'll make a name for ourselves, ya know? So we don't end up scattered everywhere on this planet.' 5. And God, like, decided to check out this city and tower that the people were busy constructing. 6. And God was like, check it out, these people are totally united, they all speak the same language and they're working together on this project. And honestly, there's no limit to what they can achieve if they continue like this. 7. Yo, let's slide in and mix things up, making their languages all tangled so they can't even understand each other no more. 8. And then God spread them out all over the place, like, all over the earth, you know? And they totally stopped working on that city. 9. So they named it Babel because God messed with everyone's language there, and then God scattered people all over the earth. 10. This is the story of Shem: Shem was already 100 years old when he became a dad and had a son named Arphaxad, just two years after the big flood. 11. So, Shem lived for a whopping five hundred years after he became a dad to Arphaxad. And during that time, he kept on adding to his fam with more sons and daughters. Impressive, right? 12. And Arphaxad was around 35 years old when he became a dad to Salah: 13. And Arphaxad kept on living for four hundred and three years after Salah was born, and he had a bunch of sons and daughters. 14. And Salah was around thirty years old when he became a dad to Eber: 15. After Salah became the father of Eber, he lived for a total of 403 years and had both sons and daughters. 16. Then Eber lived for thirty-four years and had a son named Peleg (who is also known as Phalec in Greek).\" } 17. And Eber kept on living for a cool 430 years after he became a dad to Peleg. He also had other kiddos, both boys and girls. Talk about a full family tree! 18. Peleg was chillin' for 30 years and then he became a dad to Reu. 19. After Peleg became a dad to Reu, he kept living for another 209 years and had a bunch of kids, both boys and girls. 20. And Reu lived for 32 years and became the father of Serug, whose Greek name is Saruch. 21. And Reu was like, totally around for a cool 207 years after he had Serug, and during that time, he had both sons and daughters. The fam was growing, you know! 22. Then Serug was living his best life for thirty years, and he became the proud parent of Nahor: 23. And Serug, like, lived for another two hundred years after he became a dad to this dude Nahor, and he, like, had a bunch of sons and daughters, man! 24. And Nahor was 29 years old when he became the father of Terah. (Terah's Gr. name is Thara) 25. And Nahor was alive for 119 years after he became a dad to Terah. During that time, he had both sons and daughters. 26. So, Terah was around seventy years old when he became a proud dad to Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 27. This is the fam tree of Terah: Terah had three kids: Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran had a son named Lot. 28. And Haran passed away before his dad Terah in the place where he was born, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 29. So, Abram and Nahor got themselves wives. Abram's wife was named Sarai, and Nahor's wife was named Milcah. Milcah was the daughter of Haran, who was the father of Milcah and Iscah. 30. But Sarai couldn't have kids. She didn't have any children. 31. So Terah was like, 'Let's go, fam!' He took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (Haran's son), and his daughter-in-law Sarai (who was married to Abram). They all left Ur of the Chaldees and were heading to Canaan. Along the way, they stopped and settled in Haran. 32. So Terah lived for 205 years, and then he passed away in Haran.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 111. And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech. {language: Heb. lip.} {speech: Heb. words} 2. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there. {from...: or, eastward} 3. And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. {they said...: Heb. a man said to his neighbour} {burn...: Heb. burn them to a burning} 4. And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top {may reach} unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. 5. And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. 6. And the LORD said, Behold, the people {is} one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. 7. Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech. 8. So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. 9. Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. {Babel: that is, Confusion} 10. These {are} the generations of Shem: Shem {was} an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: 11.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 121. So, God was like, 'Abram, you gotta leave your hometown, your fam, and your dad's place and go to a new land that I'll show you.' 2. And I will turn you into an awesome nation, bless you, and make your name famous; so that you'll be a total blessing. 3. And anyone who supports and shows kindness towards you, I will bring blessings into their lives. But those who oppose and speak ill of you, I will bring upon them negativity and hardships. Through you, all the people of the Earth will receive bountiful blessings. 4. So, Abram bounced, just like the LORD told him to. And Lot tagged along too. Abram was 75 years old when he dipped out of Haran. 5. So, Abram brings along his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all their stuff that they had collected, including the people they had acquired in Haran. And off they go to the land of Canaan, and sure enough, they arrive in Canaan. 6. So Abram traveled through the land until he reached Sichem, which was a chill spot in the plain of Moreh. It's worth mentioning that the Canaanite peeps were living there at that time, just so you know. 7. So, God showed up to Abram and was like, 'Yo, this land is gonna be all yours, and to your descendants too.' And then Abram was like, Wordd!' And he built an altar to honor God, who had just shown Himself to Abram. 8. Then he moved to a mountain east of Bethel and set up camp, with Bethel on the west and Hai on the east. There, he built an altar to honor the LORD and called upon His name. 9. So Abram kept on moving, continuing his journey towards the south. #travelgoals 10. So, like, there was a huge food shortage in the land, and Abram was like, 'Well, gotta find a new spot to chill.' So he went down to Egypt to stay there for a while, because the famine was pretty awful, ya know? 11. And when they were about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, 'Look, babe, I can't help but notice you're a total hottie.' 12. So, like, when the Egyptians see you, they'll be all like, 'That's his wife!', but, uh, they're totally gonna try to kill me, but don't worry, they'll spare you. 13. Yo, can you just go along with the whole 'you're my sister' thing? It'll be better for both of us. And trust me, my life will be so much better thanks to you. 14. So, like, Abram went to Egypt, and the Egyptians saw that the woman was, like, super attractive. 15. The peeps who were in charge under Pharaoh noticed her, and they were like, 'Wow, she's pretty cool!' So they brought her to Pharaoh's crib. 16. And he treated Abram really well because of her, and he had tons of cool stuff like sheep, oxen, donkeys, guys who worked for him, girls who worked for him, and even more donkeys and camels. 17. And God really messed up Pharaoh and his fam with some serious troubles all because of Sarai, who was Abram's wifey. 18. So Pharaoh hit up Abram and was like, 'Bro, what's the deal with this move you pulled on me? Why didn't you let me know she was your wife?'\" } 19. Why'd you lie and say she's my sis? If you'd just told the truth, I could've married her. But hey, here's your wifey, you can have her back now. Peace out. 20. And Pharaoh was like, yo, tell all his crew to bounce. So they sent him, his wifey, and all his stuff on their way.\"} \n",

And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. 4. So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram {was} seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran. 5. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came. 6. And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite {was} then in the land. {plain: Heb. plains} 7. And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. 8. And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, {having} Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. 9. And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. {going...: Heb. in going and journeying} 10. And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine {was} grievous in the land. 11. And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou {art} a fair woman to look upon: 12. Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This {is} his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. 13. Say, I pray thee, thou {art} my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. 14.

The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house. 16. And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. 17. And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife. 18. And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What {is} this {that} thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she {was} thy wife? 19. Why saidst thou, She {is} my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take {her}, and go thy way. 20. And Pharaoh commanded {his} men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 131. So Abram, his wife, and everything they had, along with Lot, went up to the south after leaving Egypt. 2. Abram had, like, a ton of cows, plus he had stacks of silver and gold. 3. So he traveled from the south to Bethel, to the same spot where his tent had been at the start, between Bethel and Hai. 4. And Abram went back to where he had set up the altar before and called on the name of the LORD. 5. And Lot was with Abram, and he had a bunch of animals, like flocks and herds, and he lived in tents too. 6. The land couldn't handle both of them living together because they had so much stuff and there just wasn't enough space. 7. So, like, there was some drama going on between the ranch guys who took care of Abram's cows and the ones who took care of Lot's cows. And just to add to the mix, the Canaanite and Perizzite homies were also living in that same area at the time. 8. Abram was like, yo Lot, let's not get into any unnecessary drama between us or our crew. We're fam, bro. 9. Hey, you see this whole place around us? Can you do me a solid favor and go your own way? If you wanna go left, cool, I'll take the right. And if you wanna head right, that's fine too, I'll just go left. No hard feelings! 10. So, like, Lot looked out and saw this totally well-watered place called the plain of Jordan. It was all lush and green, kind of like a beautiful garden or even the land of Egypt. This was before God wiped out Sodom and Gomorrah, by the way. And it stretched all the way to this place called Zoar. 11. So Lot picked the whole cool area near the Jordan River, and he went on a journey towards the east. That's when they decided to go their separate ways. 12. Abram was living in Canaan, and Lot was living in the cities of the plain, and set up his tent facing Sodom. 13. But yo, the dudes in Sodom were straight up evil and sinners, no cap, like mega bad in the eyes of the LORD. 14. And God was like, 'Yo Abram, now that Lot dipped and it's just you, peep this: Look around you, bro! Look all the way to the north, south, east, and west.' 15. Check it out, everything you lay your eyes on, it's all yours! And not just for you, but for all your future generations too, forever! 16. And I'll make your descendants so numerous like the dust on the ground that no one can even count! They'll be as uncountable as the grains of sand on a beach. 17. Yo, get up and start exploring this place, from one end to the other. I'm gonna hook you up with all of it. 18. After that, Abram packed up his tent and moved to the chill spot in Mamre, which is in Hebron. He decided to set up a dope altar there to show love and respect to the LORD.\"} \n",

And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; 4. Unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD. 5. And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents. 6. And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together. 7. And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land. 8. And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for we {be} brethren. {brethren: Heb. men brethren} 9. {Is} not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me: if {thou wilt take} the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if {thou depart} to the right hand, then I will go to the left. 10. And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it {was} well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, {even} as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar. 11. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other. 12. Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched {his} tent toward Sodom. 13. But the men of Sodom {were} wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly. 14. And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 15. For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever. 16. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, {then} shall thy seed also be numbered. 17. Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee. 18. Then Abram removed {his} tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which {is} in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the LORD. {plain: Heb. plains} \n",

Back in the day when Amraphel was ruling over Shinar, Arioch was the king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer was the big shot king of Elam, and Tidal was the king who ruled over everyone else. 2. So, like, these dudes totally went to war against Bera, the king of Sodom, and Birsha, the king of Gomorrah, and Shinab, the king of Admah, and Shemeber, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 3. All these homies were chillin' together in the spot called Siddim, which is the salt sea, you know. 4. So, like, for a solid twelve years, they totally did whatever Chedorlaomer wanted and stuff. But then, in the thirteenth year, they were like, 'nah, we're not about that anymore,' and started rebelling against him. 5. In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and his crew rolled up and totally wrecked the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, took down the Zuzims in Ham, and crushed the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim. (Shaveh means \"plain\" by the way, just so you know) 6. And the Horites lived in their mountain Seir, until they reached Elparan, which is near the wilderness. (Elparan can also be called the plain of Paran.) 7. So they went back and arrived at Enmishpat, which is called Kadesh. They totally crushed all the Amalekites and the Amorites who were living in Hazezontamar. 8. Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also known as Zoar) all decided to have a big fight in the valley of Siddim. 9. So there were these four kings, Chedorlaomer from Elam, Tidal from a bunch of nations, Amraphel from Shinar, and Arioch from Ellasar. And they were up against five other kings. It was a real clash of titans! 10. So, like, the whole area of Siddim was, like, filled with these gross slimepits and stuff. And the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, they ran away and ended up falling into them, and the others who were left behind, they tried to escape to the mountains. 11. So they grabbed all the swag from Sodom and Gomorrah, including their snacks, and dipped out. 12. So, like, they grabbed Lot, who's Abram's nephew, you know? And he was living in Sodom at the time. They also took all his stuff and then left. 13. So there was this person who managed to get away and they went and told Abram the Hebrew. Abram was living in the plain of Mamre, along with his friends Eshcol and Aner, who were Amorites. They were all really tight with Abram, like a crew. 14. When Abram found out that his brother got kidnapped, he gathered his skilled squad, all homies born in his crib, a total of 318 peeps, and chased after the kidnappers until they reached Dan. (armed: or, took charge of) (trained: or, schooled) 15. So, like, he split up with his crew and went all sneak mode on them in the middle of the night. He straight up attacked them, then kept chasing after them all the way to Hobah, which is, like, on the left side of Damascus. 16. So, he ended up recovering all the stuff, and he also managed to bring back his bro Lot, along with his possessions, the women, and all the people too. 17. So, like, the king of Sodom came out to meet him after he came back from defeating Chedorlaomer and the other kings who were with him, at this place called the valley of Shaveh, which is, like, the king's valley. 18. Then Melchizedek, the king of Salem, came out with some bread and wine. He was actually serving as a priest of God Almighty. 19. And he's like, yo, blessed AF is Abram, like seriously blessed by the most high God, the boss of heaven and earth, bro: 20. Shout out to the Most High God, who totally handed your enemies to you. And guess what? You hooked Him up with a sick 10% of all the spoils! 21. The king of Sodom was like, 'Yo Abram, hook me up with the people, and you can keep all the stuff.' (By peoplee' he means souls, ya know.) 22. And Abram was like, yo king of Sodom, listen up. I swear on the name of the LORD, who's like, the super OG God, ruler of the whole dang universe, heaven and earth and all that. 23. I promise not to take even a single thread or shoelace from you, and I won't accept anything that belongs to you. I don't want you to think that you made me rich. 24. Just make sure the stuff that the squad and I, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, had already chowed down on, don't touch that. Let them have their share.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 141. And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of nations; 2. {That these} made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar. 3. All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea. 4. Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 5. And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that {were} with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim, {Shaveh...: or, The plain of Kiriathaim} 6. And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which {is} by the wilderness. {Elparan: or, The plain of Paran} 7. And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which {is} Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar. 8. And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same {is} Zoar;) and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim; 9. With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five. 10. And the vale of Siddim {was full of} slimepits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain. 11. And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way. 12. And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed. 13. And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these {were} confederate with Abram. {plain: Heb. plains} 14. And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained {servants}, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued {them} unto Dan. {armed: or, led forth} {trained: or, instructed} 15. And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which {is} on the left hand of Damascus. 16. And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people. 17. And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that {were} with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which {is} the king's dale. 18. And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he {was} the priest of the most high God. 19. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed {be} Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: 20. And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all. 21. And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. {persons: Heb. souls} 22. And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, 23. That I will not {take} from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that {is} thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: 24.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 151. So, like, after all that stuff went down, the word of the LORD came to Abram in, like, a vision, saying, 'Don't stress, Abram! I've got your back, dude. I'm gonna hook you up with, like, the biggest reward ever!' 2. And Abram was like, 'Yo Lord GOD, I'm keepin' it real here. What's the dealio? I ain't got no kids of my own, and this dude Eliezer from Damascus is basically runnin' the show at my crib. What's up with that?' 3. And Abram was like, yo, I gotta be real with you, God. Like, I don't have any kids of my own, and this dude Eliezer, who was born in my house, is gonna inherit all my stuff. Help a bro out, God. 4. Yo, guess what? The big man upstairs dropped a message, saying that your heir won't be the one you think, but someone who's actually blood-related to you. 5. Then he took him outside and said, 'Yo, check out the sky. Try counting all them stars if you can. And he told him, 'That's how many descendants you're gonna have, yo.'\" } 6. And he totally trusted in the LORD; and the LORD was like, 'That's some real righteousness right there.'\" } 7. And he's like, 'Dude, I'm totally the LORD who saved you from Ur of the Chaldees just so you could get this land and own it, you know?' 8. And, like, he's asking, Lord GOD, how can I be sure that I'll totally inherit it? 9. Yo, he told him, grab a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old she goat, a three-year-old ram, and also a turtledove and a young pigeon. 10. Then he collected all of them and split them in half, placing each piece next to each other. However, he didn't split the birds. 11. And when the birds showed up and started feasting on the dead bodies, Abram scared them away. 12. As the sun was setting, Abram suddenly felt really tired and dozed off. Then, out of nowhere, a super intense feeling of darkness and fear overcame him. 13. And he said to Abram, like, listen up, dude. Just so you know, your descendants are gonna be living as outsiders in a land that ain't even theirs. They'll be serving those peeps and going through some tough times, like, for a solid four hundred years. 14. And that nation they'll serve, I'll totally judge them. But after that, they'll come out with amazing wealth and all. 15. And you will peacefully join your ancestors; you'll be laid to rest at a ripe old age with respect. 16. But it will take four generations for them to come back here, because the Amorites haven't reached their full wrongdoing yet. 17. And as the sun went down and it got dark, something amazing happened – there appeared a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that moved between those pieces. The lamp was like a fire! 18. On that day, God made a deal with Abram, like a solid agreement, you know? He was all like, 'I'm handing over this land to your descendants, from one side of Egypt's river to the mighty Euphrates river!' No Cap. 19. There were these cool groups called the Kenites, Kenizzites, and Kadmonites, 20. And there were also the Hitties, the Perizzies, and the Rephaim people, 21. And then there were the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 151. After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I {am} thy shield, {and} thy exceeding great reward. 2. And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house {is} this Eliezer of Damascus? 3. And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir. 4. And, behold, the word of the LORD {came} unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. 5. And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. 6. And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness. 7. And he said unto him, I {am} the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it. 8. And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? 9. And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon. 10. And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not. 11. And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away. 12. And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him. 13. And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land {that is} not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 14. And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance. 15. And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age. 16. But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites {is} not yet full. 17. And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces. {a burning...: Heb. a lamp of fire} 18. In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 19.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 161. So, like, Sarai, who was Abram's wife, couldn't have any kids of her own. But she had this handmaid, who was Egyptian, and her name was Hagar. Just FYI. 2. So Sarai was like, yo Abram, God has stopped me from getting pregnant. So, like, can you be with my maid? Maybe I can have kids through her. And Abram was like, okay, I'll do what you say, Sarai. 3. So, like, Sarai, who's Abram's wife, she, like, took Hagar, who's her maid and also, like, from Egypt? This happened after Abram had been living in Canaan for ten years, you know? And Sarai gave Hagar to Abram, like, as his wife and stuff. 4. So, he got with Hagar, and she ended up getting pregnant. And when she realized she was pregnant, she started disrespecting her mistress. 5. And Sarai was like, 'Abram, this whole situation is on you, man. I gave you my servant to have a child with and now she's acting all high and mighty because she's pregnant. God better step in and be the judge between us.'\" } 6. But Abram told Sarai, 'Look, Hagar is under your authority, so treat her as you see fit.' Unfortunately, when Sarai mistreated Hagar, she decided to run away from her.  7. So, like, the angel of the LORD spotted her chilling by a totally cool water fountain in the middle of nowhere, on the way to Shur. 8. And he was like, hey Hagar, Sarai's assistant, where did you come from? And where are you headed? And she was like, dude, I'm running away from Sarai because she's driving me crazy. 9. Then the angel of the LORD said to her, 'Go back to your boss lady and humble yourself under her authority.' 10. And the angel of the LORD was like, 'Yo, I gotta tell you something amazing. Your descendants are gonna be so many, like, impossible to count! 11. Then the LORD's angel was like, hey, listen up! You're gonna have a baby boy and his name's gonna be Ishmael. Why? 'Cause God totally heard your sufferings, girl. (Ishmael means God shall hear, just so you know.) 12. And he's gonna be like, a total rebel, always clashing with people and everyone clashing with him too. It's like he's destined to live in constant conflict with his fam. 13. Then she called the LORD who talked to her, and said, 'Dude, you totally see me, right? I mean, I've been looking out for this guy who can see me, too. It's crazy, right?' 14. So they named the well Beerlahairoi, because, like, it's located between Kadesh and Bered. Beerlahairoi means, like, 'The well of the one who is alive and sees me,' you know? 15. So, Hagar gave birth to a son for Abram, and Abram named his son Ishmael, just as Hagar had given birth to him. 16. Abram was 86 years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael, fam.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 161. Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name {was} Hagar. 2. And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai. {obtain...: Heb. be built by her} 3. And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife. 4. And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. 5. And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong {be} upon thee: I have given my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between me and thee. 6. But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid {is} in thy hand; do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face. {as...: Heb. that which is good in thine eyes} {dealt...: Heb. afflicted her} 7. And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur. 8. And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai. 9. And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands. 10. And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude. 11.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 171. So when Abram was 99 years old, God showed up and said to him, 'I'm the Almighty God, yo! Live your life just right in front of me and be real, like, sincere and all.' 2.

And Abram was like, woah, and he totally fell on his face, and then God was like, 'Sup, bro?' and started chatting with him, saying, 4. As for me, listen up, I've got a deal with you. You'll become a dad to a whole bunch of nations. Like, seriously, a whole multitude of nations! 5. Dude, from now on you won't be called Abram anymore. Your new name is Abraham, because I've made you the father of many nations. Abraham means Fatherr of a great multitude', just so you know. 6.

Like, you and your future fam gotta keep it going for generations to come.'\" } 10. Yo, listen up fam. This is the deal: I'm makin' a covenant with you and your descendants. Every male in your crew gotta get circumcised, no exceptions. 11. So like, you gotta, um, cut off the excess skin from your... you know, private area. And that's gonna symbolize the special agreement between me and you, got it? 12. On the eighth day, all male children among you, whether they are born in your house or bought from a non-relative, must be circumcised. This applies to every generation. The term sonn of eight days' is used in Hebrew to refer to an infant who is eight days old. 13. If someone is born into your fam or if you bought them, they gotta get circumcised. And my covenant will always be in your bodies as an everlasting covenant. 14. If a guy is not circumcised, he's not part of the crew. He's straight up breaking our agreement, so he's gotta peace out from the clique. 15. God told Abraham, yo, listen up, Sarai ain't gonna be her name no more. From now on, she's gonna be called Sarah, ya feel me? And just so you know, Sarah means Princess, that's what's up. 16. And I'm gonna hook Sarah up real good. She's gonna have a son, you feel me? Not only that, but I'm gonna bless her and she's gonna birth nations. Like, legit, kings are gonna come from her, man. It's gonna be epic. 17. Abraham straight up face-planted and cracked up. He was like, for real though, can a super old dude like me even have a kid? And Sarah, at ninety years old, gonna give birth? That's wild! 18. And Abraham was like, yo God, I'm hoping that Ishmael gets to live in your presence! 19. And God was like, yo, Abraham, your wifey Sarah is gonna have a legit son, for real. And you gotta name him Isaac. Oh, and I'm gonna make a super tight covenant with him, like forever and ever, and with all his future fam, it's gonna be lit. 20. Yo, about Ishmael, I got you covered. Check it out, I have blessed him big time and he's gonna have mad descendants, like a ton of 'em. He'll even be the father of twelve rulers and I'm gonna make his nation hella strong. 21. But here's the deal: I'm gonna make my special promise with Isaac, the son that Sarah's gonna have for you around this time next year. 22. And then they finished their convo, and God bounced from Abraham's crib. 23. So Abraham gathered up Ishmael, his son, along with all his household members and those he had acquired with his money. They were all males who belonged to Abraham's household. And on that very day, they all underwent circumcision, just as God had instructed him to do. 24. Abraham was like, super old, man, like ninety-nine years old, when he got circumcised. Yeah, his foreskin was beast-mode removed and all that. 25. Ishmael was just a cool 13-year-old when he got circumcised and went through that snip procedure. 26. On that very day, Abraham got circumcised along with his son Ishmael. 27.

Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall {a child} be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear? 18. And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee! 19. And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, {and} with his seed after him. 20. And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. 21. But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year. 22. And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. 23.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 181. So, like, the LORD showed up to him in this chill place called Mamre.

And he looked up and saw three dudes hanging out, so he hurried over to meet them from the entrance of his tent and respectfully bowed down. 3. And I was like, 'Yo, Lord, if you vibe with me, please don't bounce, I'm beggin' ya, stay with me, hear my plea:' 4. Yo, could ya please grab some water real quick and wash your feet? Then feel free to chill and take a break under the tree. 5. I'll get you some bread to cheer you up and give you strength, then you can continue on your journey. That's why you came to me, right? And they agreed, saying, \"Yeah, sure, do what you said.\" 6. So Abraham quickly went into the tent where Sarah was and said, 'Hey Sarah, can you get ready fast and prepare three measures of fine meal? Knead it and make some cakes on the hearth.' 7. So Abraham quickly went to his herd and got a young and fresh calf. He gave it to one of his young dudes and they hurried to prepare it for a meal. 8. Then he brought some butter, milk, and the deliciously prepared calf and placed it in front of them. He stood beside them under the tree while they enjoyed their meal. 9.

So like, Abraham and Sarah were really old, like ancient, you know? And Sarah couldn't have babies anymore, like she couldn't have periods. It was, like, not possible for her to get pregnant. 12. So Sarah couldn't help but laugh to herself and said, 'Seriously, am I supposed to find pleasure in my old age when my husband is just as old?'\" } 13. And God was like, Abrahamm, seriously, why did Sarah laugh and doubt that she could have a baby when she's old?' 14. Like, seriously, is anything too difficult for the LORD? I mean, at the right time, I'll totally come back to you, just like when everything's blooming and awesome, and Sarah will totally give birth to a son, no doubt about it. 15. Sarah was like, 'Nah, I didn't laugh!' She was scared, you know? But then he goes, 'Nuh-uh, you totally laughed!' 16. So, the guys got up and checked out what was happening in Sodom. And Abraham tagged along to guide them. 17. So God was like, should I keep this thing I'm about to do a secret from Abraham or what? 18. Yo, check it out. The big man upstairs promised Abraham that his crew was gonna blow up and become a legit powerhouse, you know, a sick nation. And get this, not only that, but everyone from all around the globe would be blessed because of him. Pretty dope, right? 19. I totally know that Abraham is gonna be all about making sure his kids and household follow the Lord's teachings, doing what's right and fair. And because of that, the Lord will totally make sure Abraham gets all the awesome blessings He promised him. 20. And God was like, yo, the noise comin' from Sodom and Gomorrah is off the charts, and their actions are seriously messed up. 21. I'm gonna check it out for myself, see if they're really doing what I've heard. And if not, I'll find out the truth. 22. And the dudes were like, Peacee out!' and headed towards Sodom, but Abraham stayed chill, still chilling with the LORD. 23. Abraham came forward and asked, like yo, are you gonna wipe out the good peeps along with the wicked ones? 24. Yo, suppose there's like fifty righteous peeps in that city. Would you even wreck the whole place, not sparing it for the sake of those fifty righteous homies living there? 25. God, it's not cool at all for you to treat the righteous and the wicked the same. You definitely wouldn't want to go around smiting righteous people along with the wicked ones, right? The Judge of everyone surely knows how to do what's fair, don't they? 26. God was like, 'Yo, if I come across fifty chill and righteous people in Sodom, I'll save the whole city just for them.'\" } 27. And Abraham was like, yo, listen up, I'm about to talk to the Big Guy up there, even though I'm just a tiny speck of dirt and dust. 28. Yo, what if there's only five righteous peeps missing from the 50? You gonna wipe out the whole city just cuz of five? And then he's like, nah if I find 45 righteous peeps, I won't destroy it. 29. Then he talked to him again and said, 'Maybe if there are like forty people there, will you save the place?' And he replied, 'Nah fam, even if there were forty, I'm not doing it for their sake.'\" } 30. And he's like, 'Yo, chill, don't get mad, but hear me out. Maybe there's like, 30 good people there.' And the other dude's like, 'Nah man, even if there are 30, I ain't gonna do it.'\" } 31. And he was like, yo, I'm gonna talk to the big boss, the Lord. Maybe, just maybe, if there's like, twenty good people in there, the whole place won't get wrecked. 32. And the guy was like, please don't get mad, Lord. I just wanna say one more thing. Maybe if there's like ten good people there, you won't destroy the place, right? 33. And God went on his way, soon after having finished talking with Abraham. And Abraham went back to where he was.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 181. And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; {plain: Heb. plains} 2. And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw {them}, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, 3. And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 4. Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: 5. And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said. {comfort: Heb. stay} {are...: Heb. you have passed} 6. And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead {it}, and make cakes upon the hearth. {Make ready...: Heb. Hasten} 7. And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave {it} unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. 8. And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set {it} before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. 9. And they said unto him, Where {is} Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. 10. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard {it} in the tent door, which {was} behind him. 11. Now Abraham and Sarah {were} old {and} well stricken in age; {and} it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. 12. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 13. And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? 14. Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. 15. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. 16. And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. 17. And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; 18. Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 19. For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. 20. And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; 21. I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. 22. And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. 23. And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? 24. Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that {are} therein? 25. That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 26. And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. 27. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which {am but} dust and ashes: 28. Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for {lack of} five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy {it}. 29. And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do {it} for forty's sake. 30. And he said {unto him}, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do {it}, if I find thirty there. 31. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy {it} for twenty's sake. 32. And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy {it} for ten's sake. 33. And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 191. So, like, two angels showed up in Sodom one evening, and Lot was chilling at the gate. When he saw them, he got up and went to greet them, showing mad respect by bowing down with his face to the ground. 2. And he was like, yo dudes, why don't you come chill at my crib for the night? You can crash, freshen up, and bounce early in the morning. But they were like, nah man, we're down to stay out in the streets for the night. 3. He really insisted, so they finally agreed and went to his place. He threw them an awesome party, cooking up some delicious unleavened bread that they all enjoyed. 4. But before they went to bed, all the guys from the city, like literally everyone from Sodom, gathered around the house. It was a mix of old and young, and they came from all over the place. 5. So, like, these people were calling out to Lot and asking him, 'Yo, where are those dudes who came to hang with you tonight? Bring 'em out so we can get to know them.'\" } 6. So Lot came out of the crib and closed the door behind him. 7. Yo, fam, I'm just sayin', please, don't be doing that wicked stuff. 8. Listen up, fam! I've got two daughters who haven't been with anyone, so how 'bout I bring them out to y'all, and you can do whatever you think is right. Just don't lay a finger on these guys, 'cause they're under my protection, yo. 9. And they were like, 'Yo, step aside!' And they were like, 'This dude just showed up in town and now he wants to be all judgy. We're gonna treat you even worse than those other peeps!' And they started hella pressuring Lot, getting all up in his face, almost breaking down the door. 10. The guys grabbed Lot and brought him inside, then quickly closed the door. 11. And they totally blinded the guys at the entrance of the house, like everyone, young and old. It was so crazy that they were like super tired from trying to find the door. 12. The guys were like, 'Hey Lot, do you have anyone else here? Like, your son-in-law, sons, daughters, or whatever else you have in the city? Get them out of here, man.' 13. We're gonna wreck this place, 'cause their cries have gotten way too loud in front of the LORD, and He's sent us to demolish it. 14. Then Lot went to talk to his sons-in-law, who were married to his daughters, and he said, 'Hey, you guys need to leave this city ASAP! The Lord is gonna wreck this place.' But his sons-in-law thought he was just playing around and didn't take him seriously. 15. And when morning came, the angels quickly told Lot, 'Wake up, dude! Grab your wife and your two daughters who are here, before you get caught up in the city's messed up ways and face the consequences. {are here: Found them, seriously} {iniquity: or, punishment} 16. And as he hesitated, the guys grabbed his hand, along with the hands of his wife and two daughters, because the Lord was being merciful to him. They led him out and placed him outside the city. 17. Suddenly, when they finally got outside, he said, 'Dude, you need to bounce and save your own skin. Don't even glance backwards, and don't waste any time in this whole area. Head for the mountains ASAP, otherwise you'll be totally wrecked.' 18. And Lot was like, um, hold up, fam, nah, my Lord: 19. Yo, listen up! Your servant here, I gotta say, you've been super kind to me. Your mercy has been off the charts, especially when you saved my life. But here's the thing, running to the mountains ain't gonna cut it. I'm afraid some bad stuff might go down and I won't make it out alive. 20. Yo, check it out, this town is hella close to bounce to, and it's not even big: Yo, lemme dip there, it's lowkey small, right? And if I do, I'll be livin' my best life. 21. And he was like, yo, I'm totally down with what you're saying. I won't wreck this city you're talkin' about. Your vibes are accepted, my dude. 22. Quick, get out of here ASAP! I can't do anything until you reach that place. That's why the city was named Zoar, which means 'Little'. 23. When Lot entered Zoar, the sun had already come up. {gone forth: Hebrew for risen} 24. Then God straight up dropped fire and brimstone from the sky onto Sodom and Gomorrah; like, it was intense. 25. And like, he totally wiped out those cities, along with all the surrounding area and everyone living there, including all the crops and stuff. 26. But his wife, like, totally turned around and peeked back, and she, like, instantly turned into a giant salt statue. 27. And Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the same spot where he had stood before the LORD: 28. He checked out Sodom and Gomorrah, along with all the other cities in the area, and saw that they were in ruins. Smoke rose from the land, billowing like smoke from a giant furnace. 29. So, like, when God was wrecking those cities in the plain, He remembered Abraham and made sure Lot got out of there before the whole place went down. Lot was living in one of those cities, you know. 30. So Lot bounced outta Zoar and moved to the mountains with his two daughters. He was too freaked out to stay in Zoar, so they bunked in a cave together. 31. The older sibling said to the younger one, 'Listen, our dad is getting up there in age, and there's literally no one else in the entire world for us to find a future partner like everyone else does.' 32. Yo, let's get dad drunk and sleep with him so that we can keep his bloodline going. 33. And, like, they totally got their dad to drink wine that night. And then, the oldest sibling went in and slept with their dad. And, like, he didn't even realize when she lay down or when she got up. 34. The next day, the eldest sibling said to the younger one, 'Listen up, bro. Last night, I slept with our dad. Let's get him drunk again tonight and you can do the same thing. That way, we can keep our family bloodline going.' 35. That night, they got their dad to have some wine too. The youngest one got up and slept with him, and he didn't even realize when she got in or got out of bed. 36. {\n",
      "  \"translation\": \"Both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their own father.\"\n",
      "} 37. The oldest child had a son and named him Moab, who ended up being the ancestor of the Moabites, even till now. 38. And the younger sister also had a baby boy and named him Benammi. He later became the ancestor of the Ammonite people to this very day.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 191. And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing {them} rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 2. And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. 3. And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. 4. But before they lay down, the men of the city, {even} the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: 5. And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where {are} the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. 6. And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, 7. And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 8. Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as {is} good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. 9. And they said, Stand back. And they said {again}, This one {fellow} came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, {even} Lot, and came near to break the door. 10. But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. 11. And they smote the men that {were} at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door. 12. And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring {them} out of this place: 13. For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. 14. And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law. 15. And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. {are here: Heb. are found} {iniquity: or, punishment} 16. And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. 17. And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. 18. And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my Lord: 19. Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 20. Behold now, this city {is} near to flee unto, and it {is} a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, ({is} it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. 21. And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. {thee: Heb. thy face} 22. Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do any thing till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar. {Zoar: that is, Little} 23. The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar. {risen: Heb. gone forth} 24. Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; 25. And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 26. But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 27. And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD: 28. And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. 29. And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt. 30. And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 31. And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father {is} old, and {there is} not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 32. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 33. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 34. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, {and} lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 35. And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 36. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. 37. And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same {is} the father of the Moabites unto this day. 38. And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same {is} the father of the children of Ammon unto this day. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 201. So Abraham peaced out from there and headed to the southern region, chillin' between Kadesh and Shur, and crashed in Gerar for a bit. 2. So Abraham was like, 'Sarah is my sister, bro!' And then Abimelech, the king of Gerar, was like, 'No way, dude!' So he sent for Sarah and took her into his crib. 3. One night, God appeared to Abimelech in a dream and gave him a serious warning. He said, 'Hey, just so you know, you're in big trouble because the woman you took is actually married to someone else. You're as good as dead.' 4. Abimelech didn't do anything with her, and he was like, yo Lord, you gonna destroy an innocent crew too? 5. Didn't he tell me that she's my sis? And even she herself said that he's my bro. I swear, deep down in my heart, I didn't mean any harm. I did it with pure intentions and clean hands. 6. So like, God comes to him in a dream and is all, 'Yeah, I totally know that you did this with pure intentions in your heart. And like, I made sure you didn't sin against me by stopping you from getting close to her.' 7. So like, give the guy back his wife, bro. He's, like, a prophet and he'll pray for you and you'll live. But if you don't give her back, just know that you'll totally die, and everyone you know too, man. 8. So Abimelech got up really early, gathered all his homies, and spilled the tea to them: and the squad was shook to their core. 9. So, Abimelech hit up Abraham and was like, 'Yo, what did you do to us? Did I do something to offend you or what? You brought a major vibe of sin upon me and my kingdom. The stuff you did, man, it was not cool at all.' 10. Abimelech straight up asked Abraham, like, what did you see that made you do this? 11. Abraham was like, yo, I had this thought, you know? I was thinking, for real though, I don't think these people here even know what it means to respect God, so I was legit scared they might straight up kill me just to take my wifey. 12. TBH, she's technically my sister. Like, same dad but different mom, ya know? And then we ended up getting hitched. 13. So, like, when God made me leave my dad's place and stuff, I told her, 'This is how you gotta have my back. Whenever we're in a new place, just say that I'm your bro, alright?' 14. So, like, Abimelech was all generous and gave Abraham a bunch of sheep, oxen, male servants, and female servants. And, get this, he even returned Abraham's wife Sarah to him! 15. And Abimelech was like, hey bro, check it out, my turf is all yours. Settle wherever you vibe the most, you know. (No pressure, do what feels right, man). 16. So Sarah, listen up, I hooked your brother up with a thousand silver coins. He's like your backup and protection, shielding you and everyone else around you. This was a lesson for her to learn from. 17. So Abraham hit up God with a prayer, and God came through in a major way, healing Abimelech, his wife, and even his crew. And guess what? They all started poppin' out kids like no tomorrow. 18. So like, God made it so none of the ladies in Abimelech's fam could get pregnant, all because my boy Abraham's wife Sarah was part of the picture.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 201. And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country, and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 2. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She {is} my sister: and Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah. 3. But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou {art but} a dead man, for the woman which thou hast taken; for she {is} a man's wife. {a man's...: Heb. married to an husband} 4. But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous nation? 5. Said he not unto me, She {is} my sister? and she, even she herself said, He {is} my brother: in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have I done this. {integrity: or, simplicity, or, sincerity} 6. And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 7. Now therefore restore the man {his} wife; for he {is} a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore {her} not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that {are} thine. 8. Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were sore afraid. 9. Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done. 10. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing? 11. And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God {is} not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 12. And yet indeed {she is} my sister; she {is} the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife. 13. And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This {is} thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall come, say of me, He {is} my brother. 14. And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and womenservants, and gave {them} unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 15. And Abimelech said, Behold, my land {is} before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee. {where...: Heb. as is good in thine eyes} 16. And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand {pieces} of silver: behold, he {is} to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that {are} with thee, and with all {other}: thus she was reproved. 17. So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bare {children}. 18. For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 211. And then God took care of Sarah, just like he promised, and did exactly what he said he would do. 2. So, like, Sarah got pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham when he was super old, just as God had said it would happen. 3. Abraham gave his son, who was born to him by Sarah, the name Isaac. 4. So, like, Abraham did what God told him to do and circumcised his son Isaac when he was just 8 days old. 5. Abraham was, like, a whole hundred years old when his son Isaac finally made an appearance in his life. 6. And Sarah was like, OMG, God made me laugh so hard that anyone who hears about it will laugh with me. 7. And she was like, who would've ever thought that Sarah, at her old age, would be breastfeeding a baby? But she did, she gave birth to a son for Abraham. 8. And the baby grew up and was no longer nursing. So, Abraham threw a massive party on the very day Isaac stopped nursing. 9. And Sarah peeped the son of Hagar the Egyptian, who she birthed for Abraham, throwing shade. 10. So she was like, Abraham, you gotta kick out this bondwoman and her son. Like, they can't be heirs with my son Isaac. 11. And Abraham was really upset about it because of his son, like it was a big deal. 12. And yo, God was like, Abraham, don't stress over this situation with your son and his mama. Listen up to everything Sarah's telling you, 'cause Isaac is the one who's gonna carry on your legacy. 13. And I'll also make a whole nation out of the son of the servant woman, because he's part of your fam. 14. Abraham woke up hella early in the morning and grabbed some bread and a bottle of water. He gave it to Hagar, and she put it on her shoulder along with the child. Then, he sent her away and she dipped, wandering in the wilderness of Beersheba. 15. And the water ran out in the bottle, so she put the baby under one of the bushes. 16. So she went and sat down nearby, keeping a distance like the length of an arrow shot, because she didn't want to witness the child's passing. She positioned herself across from him, raised her voice, and began to cry. 17. And God totally heard the boy's voice; and the angel of God hit up Hagar from the skies, and was like, 'What's going on, Hagar? Don't trip; God heard the boy's voice wherever he's at.' 18. Yo, get up, grab the kid, and keep him close; 'cause I'm gonna make him the leader of a dope nation. 19. God like totally helped her see, and she spotted a dope well with water. She went over, filled up the bottle with water, and hooked the kid up with a refreshing drink. 20. And God was chillin' with the dude; and he grew up, and lived in the wild, and became a total beast at archery. 21. So, like, he lived in this place called the wilderness of Paran, right? And then, his mom, she got him a wife from Egypt. Totally cool, right? 22. So, like, at that time, Abimelech and Phichol, the head honcho of his peeps, they came up to Abraham and were all like, 'Yo dude, God is totally chillin' with you in everything you do.'\" } 23. So, like, promise me right now, with God as the witness, that you won't be shady with me or my fam. Keep it real and show me the same love and kindness I've shown you in return. And, you know, be cool with the place you've been crashing at too, alright? Don't front on me, fam! 24. And Abraham was like, yo, I'm gonna make a solemn promise, no cap. 25. Abraham called out Abimelech for snatching a precious water source that his crew forcefully confiscated. 26. Abimelech was like, 'I have no idea who did this. You never told me, and I didn't even hear about it until today.' 27. So Abraham, like, rounded up some sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and then they both, like, made a pact and stuff. 28. And Abraham put these seven cute baby sheep in a separate group from the rest of the flock. 29. Abimelech was like, 'Yo, Abraham, what's up with those seven lambs over there? What's the deal with them? 30. So he was like, yo, take these seven cute little lamb babes from me as proof that I'm the one who dug this well. 31. So he named that place Beersheba, because that's where they made a serious promise to each other. (Beersheba means 'The well of the oath') 32. So they formed a pact at Beersheba: then Abimelech and Phichol, the top boss of his army, went back to the land of the Philistines. 33. So, Abraham decided to plant a grove in Beersheba, and he named it after the LORD, the everlasting God. (By grove, I mean a tree, just so you know.) 34. And Abraham, like, stayed in the land of the Philistines for a pretty long time, you know?\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 211. And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken. 2. For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him. 3. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 4. And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as God had commanded him. 5. And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 6. And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, {so that} all that hear will laugh with me. 7. And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have born {him} a son in his old age. 8. And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the {same} day that Isaac was weaned. 9. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had born unto Abraham, mocking. 10. Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, {even} with Isaac. 11. And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son. 12. And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. 13. And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he {is} thy seed. 14. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave {it} unto Hagar, putting {it} on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 15. And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 16. And she went, and sat her down over against {him} a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against {him}, and lift up her voice, and wept. 17. And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he {is}. 18. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 19. And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink. 20. And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. 21. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 22. And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God {is} with thee in all that thou doest: 23. Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son: {but} according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. {that thou...: Heb. if thou shalt lie unto me} 24. And Abraham said, I will swear. 25. And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. 26. And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I {of it}, but to day. 27. And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant. 28. And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. 29. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What {mean} these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 30. And he said, For {these} seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well. 31. Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they sware both of them. {Beersheba: that is, The well of the oath} 32. Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. 33. And {Abraham} planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the everlasting God. {grove: or, tree} 34. And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 221. So, after all that happened, God decided to test Abraham. He called out to him and said, Abrahamm!' And Abraham replied, 'Yo, what's up? I'm here.' 2. And God said, yo, listen up. Take your son Isaac, the one you're tight with, and head to Moriah. I want you to offer him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I'll reveal to you later on. 3. So, like, Abraham woke up super early, got his ride ready, took two of his homies, his son Isaac, and chopped up some wood for the offering. Then they all headed to the spot that God had told him about. 4. And then, on the third day, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. 5. Abraham told his squad, 'Yo, hold up with the ride; me and the homie are gonna head over there and do our worship thing, but we'll be back with y'all.'\" } 6. So Abraham grabbed the wood for the burnt offering and put it on Isaac, his son. He also took the fire and a knife in his hand, and they both headed out together. 7. Isaac talked to his dad Abraham and said, 'Hey, dad!' And Abraham replied, 'Yes, my son?' Isaac then asked, 'I see the fire and the wood, but where's the lamb for the burnt offering?'} 8. Abraham was like, 'Hey, son! God's got this covered, He's gonna hook us up with a lamb for our sacrifice.' And just like that, they headed out together on their mission. 9. So they arrived at the spot that God had directed them to. Abraham set up a sacred space, built an altar, neatly arranged the wood, and carefully tied up his son Isaac. He then placed Isaac on the altar, on top of the wood. 10. So, Abraham reached out his hand and grabbed the knife, ready to end his son's life. 11. Then this angel from the LORD hit up Abraham and was like, 'Yo, Abraham, Abraham!' And Abraham was like, 'Yeah, what's good? Here I am!' 12. And God was like, 'Yo, don't touch the kid, like, seriously, don't do anything to him. It's all good, fam, I can see that you're all about respecting me because you didn't hold back from giving up your one and only son.' 13. So, Abraham looked up and saw a ram with its horns caught in a thicket behind him. He went over, took the ram, and offered it as a burnt offering instead of his son. 14. And Abraham named that place Jehovahjireh, which basically means 'The Lord will see or provide', as people still say nowadays, He'll show up when we need Him, on His mountain. 15. Then the angel of the LORD hit up Abraham again, straight from the heavens. 16. And God said, I swear on my own name, for you have done this incredible thing without holding back your son, your one and only. 17. I'm gonna hook you up with some major blessings, like, for real. Your descendants are gonna blow up big time, like the stars in the sky or the sand on the beach, you know what I'm sayin'? Oh, and they're gonna totally crush their enemies and take over everything, no doubt. 18. And through your descendants, all the nations on earth will receive blessings, because you listened and followed what I said. 19. So Abraham went back to his squad, and they got up and rolled together to Beersheba; and Abraham settled down in Beersheba. 20. After all those events went down, Abraham got word that Milcah, you know, she ended up having some kids for his bro Nahor. 21. Huz, the eldest bro, and Buz, his fam, and Kemuel, Aram's founder, 22. And Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel were all part of the crew. 23. And Bethuel had a daughter named Rebekah, who Nahor (Abraham's bro) had eight kids with Milcah. (Rebekah is also called Rebecca in Greek.) 24. And this dude had a side chick named Reumah, and she gave birth to Tebah, Gaham, Thahash, and Maachah.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 221. And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, {here} I {am}. {Behold...: Heb. Behold me} 2. And he said, Take now thy son, thine only {son} Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. 3. And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. 4. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off. 5. And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you. 6. And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid {it} upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. 7. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here {am} I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where {is} the lamb for a burnt offering? {lamb: or, kid} 8. And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. 9. And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. 10. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. 11. And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here {am} I. 12. And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only {son} from me. 13. And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind {him} a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. 14. And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said {to} this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen. {Jehovahjireh: that is, The Lord will see, or, provide} 15. And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, 16. And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only {son}: 17. That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which {is} upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; {shore: Heb. lip} 18. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. 19. So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. 20. And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; 21. Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 22. And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. 23. And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother. {Rebekah: Gr. Rebecca} 24.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 231. Sarah was 127 years old when she passed away. That's how long she lived. 2. So, like, Sarah passed away in this place called Kirjatharba, which is the same as Hebron in Canaan. And Abraham, like, went there to grieve and cry for Sarah, ya know? 3. So, like, Abraham got up from where his peeps were chillin' with the deceased, and he started talkin' to the sons of Heth, like, yo, 4. Yo, I'm like a total outsider chilling with you here. Can you hook me up with a spot to bury my dead homie, so I don't have to see them anymore? 5. Yo, Abraham, the kids of Heth responded to him like, 6. Listen up, dude: you're, like, a powerful leader in our crew. You can totally pick any of our graves to bury your dead peeps. We've got your back and we won't stop you from using any of 'em. Just do what you gotta do. (By the way, 'a prince of God' is another way to say you're a total boss!) 7. So Abraham got up and respectfully greeted the people of the land, even the children of Heth. 8. So, like, this guy was talking with his peeps, saying, 'If you're cool with it, I wanna bury my dead away from my view. Can you lend a hand and ask Ephron, Zohar's son, for me?' 9. I'm hoping Abraham will let me have the cave of Machpelah at the edge of his field. I'll pay him whatever it's worth so I can use it as a burial place here. You guys cool with that? 10. So, Ephron was living among the children of Heth and he spoke up in front of everyone at the gate of his city, answering Abraham. It was like a public spectacle, you know?  11. Actually, listen up, sir! I want to give you the whole field and the cave that's in it. I'm giving it to you right in front of everyone. You can bury your dead there. 12. And Abraham showed respect to the people of the land by humbling himself. 13. So, he talked to Ephron in front of everyone, like, 'Hey, man, if you're down for it, listen up. I really need to buy that field from you, you know? I'll pay you a fair price for it, no worries. Just take the money from me, and I can finally give my deceased a proper burial there.' 14. Ephron was like, 'Yo Abraham, listen up,' 15. Yo, listen up, my dude: the land is valued at a cool four hundred shekels of silver. But honestly, what's that small amount gonna matter between you and me? So, let's just bury your dead fam and move on. 16. So Abraham listened to Ephron and paid him the silver he had promised, which he mentioned in front of the sons of Heth, a total of four hundred shekels of silver, the currency used by the merchants. 17. And the land that belonged to Ephron, which was in Machpelah, in front of Mamre, along with the field, the cave, and all the trees that were in the area, were legally confirmed. 18. Abraham was given this prime spot as his own in front of everyone who came through the city gate, while the children of Heth were there. 19. And then, Abraham laid Sarah, his wife, to rest in the cave of the field of Machpelah, right by Mamre. That place is known as Hebron in the land of Canaan. 20. So basically, the field and the cave in it, they were like totally secured for Abraham to use as a burial place by the sons of Heth.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 231. And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: {these were} the years of the life of Sarah. 2. And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same {is} Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 3. And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, 4. I {am} a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 5. And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 6. Hear us, my lord: thou {art} a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. {a mighty...: Heb. a prince of God} 7. And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, {even} to the children of Heth. 8. And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 9. That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which {is} in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. {as much...: Heb. full money} 10. And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, {even} of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, {audience: Heb. ears} 11. Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that {is} therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. 12.

And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou {wilt give it}, I pray thee, hear me: I will give thee money for the field; take {it} of me, and I will bury my dead there. 14. And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him, 15. My lord, hearken unto me: the land {is worth} four hundred shekels of silver; what {is} that betwixt me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. 16. And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current {money} with the merchant. 17. And the field of Ephron, which {was} in Machpelah, which {was} before Mamre, the field, and the cave which {was} therein, and all the trees that {were} in the field, that {were} in all the borders round about, were made sure 18. Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 19. And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same {is} Hebron in the land of Canaan. 20. And the field, and the cave that {is} therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 241. Abraham was, like, really old and had lived a long, fulfilling life. The Lord had hooked him up with blessings galore, like seriously, everything was going great for him. 2. So Abraham was like, 'Hey, servant dude in charge of everything I own, come here and do me a solid. Put your hand under my thigh, please.' 3. Yo, I'm gonna need you to swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and earth, that you won't let my son marry any of the Canaanite girls here where we live. Like, it's important to me, bro. 4. But you should go to my homeland and my relatives and find a wife for my son Isaac. 5. The servant was like, maybe the woman won't wanna come with me to this place. Should I bring your son back to where you're from? 6. And Abraham was like, yo, make sure you never take my son there again, alright? 7. The big man upstairs, who totally rescued me from my fam's crib and homeland, and straight up talked to me, and made a promise like 'Yo, I'll totally give this land to your peeps'; he's gonna send an angel to help you out, so you can find a wifey for my son over there. 8. And if the woman doesn't want to go with you, then you won't be bound by the promise I made. Just promise me you won't take my son there again. 9. And the servant placed his hand beneath Abraham's thigh, and made a solemn promise to him regarding that matter. 10. So the servant grabbed ten of his master's camels and set off. He had all of his master's stuff with him, and he headed to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor. 11. And he had his camels chillin' outside the city by a water well when it was getting late in the evening, you know, around the time when girls usually go out to fetch water. 12. Then he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I'm totally praying that you make things go smoothly for me today, and be super nice to my master Abraham. 13. Yo, check it out, I'm just chillin' at the water well, and these girls from the city roll up to get some water. 14. So, like, here's the plan: If I walk up to this girl and ask her for a drink from her pitcher, and then she's all like, 'Sure, and I'll give water to your camels too,' then we'll know that she's the one you chose for Isaac and that you've been showing kindness to my master. 15. So, like, while he was still talking, Rebekah suddenly shows up, and she's, like, Bethuel's daughter and Milcah's granddaughter. Oh, and BTW, Milcah is Nahor's wife, who is actually Abraham's bro. And she's got this pitcher chillin' on her shoulder, ready to go. 16. And the girl was really attractive, like, her looks were on point, and she was a total virgin, like, no one had ever been with her, you know? So she went down to the well, filled her pitcher, and came back up. She was rocking that good vibe, you feel me? 17. So the servant like, quickly went up to her and was like, 'Hey, could you totally hook me up with a sip of water from your pitcher?' 18. And she was like, 'Yo, have a sip, dude.' So she quickly took her water jug and lowered it down, then handed him a drink. 19. After she finished giving him a drink, she was like, 'Yo, I'll hook up your camels too, and keep filling up their tanks until they're fully hydrated.'\" } 20. She quickly poured the water from her pitcher into the trough, then hurried back to the well for more, drawing water for all of his camels. 21. The guy was like shook and didn't say anything, trying to figure out if God made his trip go well or not. 22. And so, after the camels were done quenching their thirst, the man grabbed a super cool golden earring that weighed half a shekel, and two awesome bracelets weighing ten shekels each for her hands. (By the way, the alternative translation for 'earring' is 'jewel for the forehead'.) 23. And the dude was like, 'Yo, whose daughter are you? Can you let us know? We need a place to crash in your pops' crib.'\" } 24. And she was like, yo, I'm the daughter of Bethuel, who is Milcah's son. My mom gave birth to me and Nahor is my dad. 25. She told him, 'We've got plenty of straw and food for the animals, and a cozy place to crash. 26. The guy lowered his head and showed respect to the LORD. 27. And he was like, OMG, how unbelievably blessed is the LORD God of my master Abraham! Like, seriously, my master has never been abandoned by God's mercy and faithfulness. And, BTW, while I was on my way, the LORD totally guided me to the house of my master's relatives. 28. So, like, the girl sprinted off and spilled the tea to her fam 'bout what went down. 29. Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and Laban straight up bolted towards the dude at the well. 30. So, like, when he noticed the cool earrings and bracelets on his sister's hands, and heard his sister Rebekah telling him all about what the man said to her, he went straight up to the man. And guess what? He found the dude chilling by the camels at the well. 31. He was like, 'Yo, come on in, you cool person blessed by the LORD. Why you waiting outside? I got the crib ready and even a spot for your camels.'\" } 32. So the guy went inside and took the belts off his camels, and then he provided them with straw and food. He also gave them water to clean their own feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 33. So, this food was brought to him to eat, but he was like, nah, I'm not gonna eat until I've finished my important task. And he was all like, go ahead and spill the tea. 34. And he was like, 'Yo, I'm Abraham's servant, you know.'\" } 35. And God has blessed my master so much, and he has become really successful. He has been given tons of animals like sheep and cows, as well as a lot of money, including silver and gold. He even has a bunch of people working for him, both guys and girls, and he has plenty of camels and donkeys too. 36. And Sarah, my master's wife, gave birth to a son for my master even though she was old. And my master has given him everything he owns. 37. So, my boss was like, 'Swear to me that you won't let my son marry any Canaanite girls, since I live among them.'\" } 38. But you gotta head to my dad's crib and link up with my fam, and find a wifey for my son, ya feel me? 39. So I told my boss, like, maybe this girl won't come with me, you know? 40. And he was like, yo, the LORD, the one I'm tight with, will totally send his angel to roll with you and make your journey successful. And when you find bae, make sure she's from my fam, like my extended fam and my dad's crib, ya feel? 41. So, like, once you reach my fam, you're totally off the hook from this promise I made. And, like, if they don't hook you up with what you need, then you're not responsible for my promise anymore. 42. So, like, I went to the well today, and I was all like, 'Yo, God of my master Abraham, if you could hook me up and make my journey successful, that would be totally awesome, you know? 43. Yo, check it out, I'm chilling near this dope water well. So here's the deal: when this cool virgin comes to get some water, I'm gonna ask her politely, 'Could you hook me up with a sip from your pitcher, please?' 44. And she says to me, 'Yo, drink up too, and I'll hook up your camels with some water. If that happens, then she's the one that the LORD has picked for my master's son.'\" } 45. And like, before I even finished like, talking to myself, bro, Rebekah straight up came out with her water pitcher on her shoulder, and went down to the well, ya know? She totally drew some water, and I was like, 'Yo, can I like, sip that?' 46. And then, like, she quickly took her pitcher off her shoulder and was all like, 'Here, bro, drink some water!' And she even offered to give water to all your camels too! So I had a drink, and she made sure the camels got hydrated as well, no cap. 47. So, like, I was all like, 'Yo, whose girl are you?' And she was like, 'I'm Bethuel's daughter, you know, Nahor's son's girl, that Milcah gave birth to.' And then I hooked her up with this sick earring for her face and some dope bracelets for her hands. 48. So, I humbly showed my respect by bowing my head and giving praise to the LORD. I blessed the LORD God of Abraham, the one who guided me in finding a suitable wife for my master's son from among our relatives. 49. Hey, listen up! If you're down to be real and show some love and respect to my boss, let me know. But if you're not about that, just be straight with me. I gotta know which way to go, whether to keep rolling with you or find another path. 50. Laban and Bethuel were like, 'Dude, this is all coming from the Lord. We can't say anything negative or positive to you.'\" } 51. Yo, check it out, Rebekah's right here, so grab her and bounce. Make her your boss's son's wifey, just like the LORD said. 52. And, like, when Abraham's servant heard what they said, he like totally worshipped the LORD by like bowing down to the earth, you know? 53. So, the servant pulled out some sick silver bling, some lit gold bling, and some fresh clothes, and he hooked Rebekah up with all of it. And he didn't forget about her brother and mother either – he gave them some dope gifts too. (BTW, in Hebrew, they call the bling 'vessels').\" } 54. And they were grubbin' and sippin', him and his homies, and chillaxed all night; then when they woke up in the morning, he said, 'Yo, let me bounce back to my master, y'know.'\" } 55. So her bro and her mom were like, yo, let the girl chill with us for a hot min, like at least ten days. But after that, she can bounce. Oh, and by the way, 'a few days' could also mean, like, a whole year or ten months, just FYI. 56. And he was like, listen up fam, don't be stopping me, 'cause the LORD has totally blessed my journey. Let me bounce and head back to my master, okay? 57. And they were like, let's go ask the girl herself and see what she says. 58. So they hit up Rebekah and asked her, 'You down to roll with this dude?' And she replied, 'Yeah, I'm down.'\"}\n",

So they said, 'Okay, Rebekah, go on your way with your nurse, Abraham's servant, and his crew. 60. And they were like, 'Rebekah, you're one of us, sis! May you be a powerful leader, raising generations upon generations, and may your descendants overcome any opposition.' 61. And Rebekah was like, 'Let's go, girls!' So they hopped on those camels and started trailing behind the guy. And the servant was like, 'Rebekah, come with me!' and they both hit the road. 62. So Isaac pulled up to the well Lahairoi because that's where he was living down in the southern part of town. 63. So Isaac decided to take a chill moment out in the field during sunset. As he looked up, he spotted a group of camels heading his way. 64. {\n",

      "KJV: Genesis 241. And Abraham was old, {and} well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. {well...: Heb. gone into days} 2. And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 3. And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 4. But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son Isaac. 5. And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? 6. And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. 7. The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. 8. And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. 9. And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. 10. And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master {were} in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor. {for: or, and} 11. And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, {even} the time that women go out to draw {water}. {that...: Heb. that women who draw water go forth} 12. And he said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. 13. Behold, I stand {here} by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: 14. And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: {let the same be} she {that} thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. 15. And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. 16. And the damsel {was} very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up. {very...: Heb. good of countenance} 17. And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. 18. And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. 19. And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw {water} for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. 20. And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw {water}, and drew for all his camels. 21. And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. 22. And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten {shekels} weight of gold; {earring: or, jewel for the forehead} 23. And said, Whose daughter {art} thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room {in} thy father's house for us to lodge in? 24. And she said unto him, I {am} the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor. 25. She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. 26. And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD. 27. And he said, Blessed {be} the LORD God of my master Abraham, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I {being} in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren. 28. And the damsel ran, and told {them of} her mother's house these things. 29. And Rebekah had a brother, and his name {was} Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the well. 30. And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. 31. And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels. 32. And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that {were} with him. 33. And there was set {meat} before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on. 34. And he said, I {am} Abraham's servant. 35. And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses. 36. And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 37. And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: 38. But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. 39. And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me. 40. And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house: 41. Then shalt thou be clear from {this} my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee {one}, thou shalt be clear from my oath. 42. And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 43. Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw {water}, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 44. And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: {let} the same {be} the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son. 45. And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew {water}: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee. 46. And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her {shoulder}, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 47. And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter {art} thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. 48. And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son. 49. And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left. 50. Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. 51. Behold, Rebekah {is} before thee, take {her}, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken. 52. And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, {bowing himself} to the earth. 53. And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave {them} to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. {jewels: Heb. vessels} 54. And they did eat and drink, he and the men that {were} with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. 55. And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us {a few} days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. {a few...: or, a full year, or ten months} 56. And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. 57. And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. 58. And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. 59. And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men. 60. And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou {art} our sister, be thou {the mother} of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them. 61. And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. 62. And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. 63. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels {were} coming. {to meditate: or, to pray} 64. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. 65. For she {had} said unto the servant, What man {is} this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant {had} said, It {is} my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself. 66. And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done. 67. And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's {death}. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 251. Abraham decided to start a new chapter in his love life and got together with a woman named Keturah. 2. And she gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 3. Jokshan became the proud dad of Sheba and Dedan. Dedan had some cool offspring too - Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 4. And here are the names of the kids of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. Yup, they're all the children of Keturah. 5. And Abraham passed down everything he owned to Isaac. 6. But Abraham also gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac while he was still alive, towards the eastern part of the country. 7. And these are the days that Abraham was on this planet, living a solid 175 years. 8. And then Abraham passed away, peacefully departing in his golden years as a wise elder, having lived a fulfilling life, and was reunited with his loved ones. 9. So Isaac and Ishmael, Abraham's sons, laid him to rest in the cave of Machpelah, which was in a field owned by Ephron the Hittite and located near Mamre. 10. Abraham bought a field from the sons of Heth, and that's where both he and his wife Sarah were laid to rest. 11. After Abraham died, God blessed his son Isaac, and Isaac lived by the well Lahairoi. 12. Here's the scoop on Ishmael, Abraham's son. Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's helper, gave birth to him. 13. So, like, here's a list of the names of Ishmael's sons, you know? They were named according to their generations and stuff. The eldest one was Nebajoth, cool name, right? Then there's Kedar, Adbeel, and Mibsam. That's the whole crew! 14. And like, there were also Mishma, Dumah, and Massa, you know? 15. Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: (Hadar, also known as Hadad) 16. These are the homies of Ishmael and these are their names, based on where they chill and the spots they run; twelve bosses repping their different nations. 17. And this is how long Ishmael lived: 137 years. Then he died and reunited with his ancestors. 18. So they lived from Havilah to Shur, which is in front of Egypt as you head towards Assyria. And he passed away while his siblings were there. 19. So, like, this is the fam tree of Isaac, Abraham's kid: Abraham was the dad who had Isaac, you know? 20. Isaac was, like, 40 years old when he decided to marry Rebekah, who was the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian from Padanaram. Oh, and she was also Laban the Syrian's sister. 21. So Isaac had a convo with the LORD about his wife, cuz she couldn't have kids. And the LORD listened to him and made it happen, and his wife Rebekah got pregnant. 22. So, like, the babies were, like, fighting inside her and she was all like, why is this happening to me? And then she decided to go ask the LORD about it. 23. And God was like, 'Yo, listen up, sis. You got two nations chillin' in your belly, and they're gonna be two totally different groups of peeps. One of 'em is gonna be more powerful than the other, and the older one's gonna end up serving the younger one.' 24. And when the time was up for her to give birth, surprise! She had not just one, but two babies growing inside her. 25. The first baby came out all red and covered in hair, so they named him Esau. 26. Then his brother came out, grabbing onto Esau's heel; his name was Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebecca gave birth to them. 27. And the dudes were all grown up: Esau was like, this super skilled hunter, always out in nature and stuff; and Jacob, on the other hand, was more of a chill dude who preferred the laid-back tent life. 28. Isaac was totally vibing with Esau because the dude knew how to cook some legit venison. But Rebekah, on the other hand, was all about Jacob. (BTW, Esau had just taken a big bite of that juicy deer meat when this whole situation went down.) 29. So Jacob cooked some really awesome food, and Esau came back from the field, super exhausted and hungry: 30. And Esau was like, 'Yo Jacob, hook me up with that fire red stew please! I'm hella starving, no cap.' That's why his name became Edom, which literally means 'Red'. 31. Yo, bro! Jacob's like, 'Sell me your birthright today.' 32. Esau was like, yo, I'm so done. Like, dying over here. What's even the point of this birthright, man? Like, what good is it gonna do me? 33. And Jacob was like, 'Yo, promise me right now.' So the other guy was like, 'Yeah, bro, I promise.' And he ended up selling his birthright to Jacob. 34. So, like, Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew. And Esau was, like, hungry so he ate and drank, then he got up and left. And that's how Esau totally disrespected his birthright, man.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 251. Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name {was} Keturah. 2. And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 3. And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 4. And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these {were} the children of Keturah. 5. And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. 6. But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. 7. And these {are} the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. 8. Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full {of years}; and was gathered to his people. 9. And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which {is} before Mamre; 10. The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 11. And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. 12. Now these {are} the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham: 13. And these {are} the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, 14.

These {are} the sons of Ishmael, and these {are} their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations. 17. And these {are} the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. 18. And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that {is} before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: {and} he died in the presence of all his brethren. {died: Heb. fell} 19. And these {are} the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac: 20. And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. 21. And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she {was} barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. 22. And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If {it be} so, why {am} I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. 23. And the LORD said unto her, Two nations {are} in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and {the one} people shall be stronger than {the other} people; and the elder shall serve the younger. 24. And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, {there were} twins in her womb. 25. And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. 26. And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac {was} threescore years old when she bare them. 27. And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob {was} a plain man, dwelling in tents. 28. And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of {his} venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. {he...: Heb. venison was in his mouth} 29. And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he {was} faint: 30. And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red {pottage}; for I {am} faint: therefore was his name called Edom. {with...: Heb. with that red, with that red pottage} {Edom: that is Red} 31. And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. 32. And Esau said, Behold, I {am} at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? {at...: Heb. going to die} 33. And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. 34. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised {his} birthright. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 261. So, like, there was a legit famine happening, you know? And it wasn't just any famine, it was the second one after the whole Abraham era. And guess what? Isaac, being the smart dude he is, decided to roll up to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, in Gerar. Can't blame the guy for trying to find some food, right? 2. And then God showed up to him and said, 'Yo, don't even think about going to Egypt. Just chill in the land that I'm gonna hook you up with.'\" } 3. Hang out in this land, and I'll be right there with you, bringing all the good vibes and blessings your way. I promise that you and your future fam will own all these dope countries, just like I swore to your dad Abraham. 4. And I'll totally hook you up with a crazy amount of descendants, like a ton of stars up in the sky! Plus, I'll hand over all these countries to your descendants, and through them, every nation on Earth will score some serious blessings. You're gonna love it, trust me! 5. Because Abraham totally prioritized listening to me and respected my instructions, rules, and guidelines. 6. So Isaac went and lived in Gerar: 7. So, the people of that area asked him about his wife, and he replied, 'She's my sis.' He was afraid to admit that she was his wife because he thought the people might kill him to have her, since she was really good-looking. 8. So, like, after Isaac had been living there for a while, Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, was checking out the scene from his window. And guess what? He spotted Isaac and Rebekah, Isaac's wife, having a chill time together. 9. So Abimelech hits up Isaac and he's like, 'Dude, you need to explain. It's pretty clear that she's your wife, so why'd you say she's your sister?' Isaac tells him straight up, 'I said that because I was scared I might get killed over her.'\" } 10. Abimelech was like, dude, what did you just do to us? It could've been really bad if some random person hooked up with your wife, and then we'd all be in trouble. 11. Abimelech told his squad, 'Look, if anyone even thinks about messing with this dude or his wife, they're straight up gonna face serious consequences - like, death, for real.'\" } 12. So Isaac planted crops in that place, and in the same year he got a crazy good harvest, like a hundred times more than what he planted. And God totally blessed him, man. Like, it was unreal. #blessed #grateful #agriculturegoals 13. And the dude totally thrived, and kept moving forward, and grew until he became seriously awesome: {went...: That's like, he kept going and going} 14. Yo, this dude had mad flocks and herds, and a bunch of servants, like, on deck. And the Philistines were totally jealous of him, bro. (BTW, servants can also mean like, workers or peeps helping out in the fields, just so you know.) 15. Back in the day, when Abraham's crew was making wells, the Philistines decided to be real petty and shut them down and fill 'em up with dirt. 16. Abimelech was like, 'Yo Isaac, you gotta bounce! You're way too powerful for us to handle.'\" } 17. So Isaac bounced from there and set up his tent in the chill spot called the valley of Gerar, and lived there. 18. So Isaac decided to reopen the water wells that his father Abraham had dug, because those pesky Philistines had plugged them up when Abraham passed away. And you know what? Isaac decided to give them the same names that his dad had given them before. 19. So Isaac's servants started digging in the valley and they discovered a well with fresh, flowing water. 20. So like, the peeps who took care of the cows in Gerar got all up in Isaac's peeps' faces, saying, 'Yo, the water's ours!' This made Isaac name the well 'Esek,' meaning, like, a big argument and all that. 21. So they dug another well, but there was a lot of conflict surrounding it, so they named it Sitnah, which means Hatred. 22. So, like, this guy moved to another place and dug a new well without any drama. He named it Rehoboth, which means 'Room', and said that the big man upstairs, the LORD, made space for us and we'll thrive in this land. Cool, right? 23. And then he went up from there to Beersheba. 24. That night, God showed up and said to him, 'Yo, I'm the one who was with your pops Abraham. Don't trip, I got your back. I'll bring you blessings and make your squad multiply, all because of Abraham, my homie.' 25. So, he built an altar and gave a shout-out to the LORD, and set up his tent there. Isaac's crew went ahead and excavated a well in that spot. 26. So Abimelech slid into his DMs from Gerar, with Ahuzzath, one of his homies, and Phichol, the head cap of his squad. 27. Isaac was like, yo, what's the deal with you guys coming to me when you clearly have beef with me and straight up kicked me out? 28. And they were like, dude, we totally noticed that God was hanging with you. So we were like, let's make this official and have an oath between us, you know, like a legit agreement. We wanna make a covenant with you, man. Like, it's real! 29. We didn't mean any harm, fam. We never laid a finger on you and we've only shown you love and respect. We let you go peacefully, and now you're totally blessed by the LORD, yo. Just saying, if you realize it. 30. And he threw them a lit party, and they totally grubbed on some epic food and drank up! 31. They woke up early in the morning and made a serious promise to each other. Then Isaac said goodbye to them and they left without any problems. 32. So, like, on that very day, Isaac's homies rolled up and gave him the scoop about the well they had dug. And they were like, 'Yo, dude, we found water!' 33. And he named it Shebah: so that's why the city is called Beersheba even today. Shebah means 'an oath', and Beersheba means 'the well of the oath'. 34. Esau was, like, 40 years old when he married Judith, who was the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and also Bashemath, who was the daughter of Elon the Hittite. No biggie. 35. And that really upset Isaac and Rebekah, it was like a major downer for them. They were totally bummed out.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 261. And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. 2. And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 3. Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; 4. And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; 5. Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 6. And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 7. And the men of the place asked {him} of his wife; and he said, She {is} my sister: for he feared to say, {She is} my wife; lest, {said he}, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she {was} fair to look upon. 8. And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac {was} sporting with Rebekah his wife. 9. And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she {is} thy wife: and how saidst thou, She {is} my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. 10. And Abimelech said, What {is} this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. 11. And Abimelech charged all {his} people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. 12. Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. {received: Heb. found} 13. And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: {went...: Heb. went going} 14. For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. {servants: or, husbandry} 15. For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. 16. And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. 17. And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 18. And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 19. And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. {springing: Heb. living} 20. And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water {is} ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. {Esek: that is, Contention} 21. And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. {Sitnah: that is, Hatred} 22. And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. {Rehoboth: that is Room} 23. And he went up from thence to Beersheba. 24. And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I {am} the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I {am} with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. 25. And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well. 26. Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 27. And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 28. And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, {even} betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; {We saw...: Heb. Seeing we saw} 29. That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou {art} now the blessed of the LORD. {That...: Heb. If thou shalt} 30. And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. 31. And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 32. And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. 33. And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city {is} Beersheba unto this day. {Shebah: That is, an oath} {Beersheba: that is, the well of the oath} 34. And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 35. Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. {a grief...: Heb. bitterness of spirit} \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 271. So, check it: Isaac was getting up there in age, and his eyesight wasn't so great anymore, you know? He called his oldest son, Esau, and was like, 'Yo, my son!' And Esau was like, 'Yeah, dad, what's up?' 2. And he was like, yo guys, listen up, I'm getting old and I really have no clue when I'm gonna kick the bucket, you feel me? 3. Hey, could you grab your gear - like your cool weapons, quiver, and bow - and head out to the wild? I'm really craving some fresh venison, so why not snag us some? Oh, and by the way, 'take' in Hebrew means 'hunt,' so go on a hunting spree for me! 4. Hey, whip up some of that delicious food that I really enjoy and bring it over to me, so I can dig in and give you my heartfelt blessing before I kick the bucket. 5. And Rebekah totally overheard when Isaac was talking to his son Esau. So Esau was like, 'Yo, I'm heading out to the field to hunt some game and bring it back.' 6. So, like, Rebekah comes up to Jacob, her son, and she's all like, 'Yo, listen up! I totally overheard our dad talking to Esau, your bro, and this is what he said: 7. Yo, go grab me some venison and whip up somethin' tasty so I can devour it and give you my blessings in front of the LORD before I kick the bucket. 8. So listen up, my homie, do what I say and follow my instructions, aight? 9. Hey, head over to the flock and grab two awesome baby goats for me. I'm gonna whip up some tasty grub for your dad, just the way he likes it. 10. And you're gonna take that thing to your dad, so he can grub and give you a dope blessing before he kicks the bucket. 11. So, like, Jacob was talking to his mom, Rebekah, and he's all like, 'Yo, check it out, Esau, my bro, he's, uh, super hairy and I'm, like, totally smooth.'\" } 12. My dad might catch onto me, and he'll see me as a liar; then I'll totally jinx myself and end up with bad luck, not good luck. 13. Then his mom was like, 'Hey, if you wanna curse someone, curse me instead, my dude. But just do me a solid and listen to what I say, go grab what I need.'\" } 14. So he went and got what she needed and brought it to his mom. His mom cooked up a delicious meal, just the way his dad liked it. 15. And Rebekah took the flyest clothes of her older son Esau, which were chillin' in the crib, and swagged them out on Jacob, her younger son. (Desirable) 16. Then she placed the goat's fur on his hands and the sleek part of his neck. 17. And she handed over the delicious food and the bread that she had made to her son Jacob. 18. So he went up to his dad and said, 'Sup, Dad?' And his dad was like, 'Hey, what's up? Who are you, my child?'} 19. Then Jacob was like, 'Yo, Dad. It's me, Esau, your firstborn. I totally did what you asked me to do. So, check it - why don't you get up and come chill with me while I serve you some bomb venison? That way, you can bless my soul, ya know?' 20. Isaac asked his son, 'Yo, how did you manage to find it so fast, bro?' And his son replied, 'Dude, it's all thanks to the LORD your God. He brought it right to me, man.' 21. Yo, Jacob, come here, bro, so I can check if you're really my son Esau or not by touchin' ya. 22. So Jacob came close to his father Isaac, and he touched him. Then Isaac said, 'The voice sounds like Jacob's voice, but the hands feel like Esau's hands.' 23. And he couldn't tell it was him because his hands were all hairy like his brother Esau's hands, so he gave him his blessing. 24. And he was like, 'Yo, are you my boy Esau?' And he was like, 'Yeah, that's me!' 25. He was like, 'Yo, bring that food over here so I can chow down on my son's delicious meat and then give you a major blessing.' So, the food was brought to him and he totally ate it. And then, he got some wine and had a sip. 26. So, like, Isaac's dad, he's all like, 'Yo, come over here and give me a kiss, bro.'\" } 27. Then he walked up to him and gave him a hug: and he noticed the pleasant scent of his clothes, and gave him his blessings, saying, 'Look, my child smells as refreshing as a field that the LORD has blessed.' 28. Yo, may God bless you with the chilled vibes of heaven's dew, and the epic richness of the earth, hooking you up with mad grain and fine wine. 29. Yo, have peeps serve you and nations show you respect. Rule over your bros and let your mom's sons show you respect too. Anyone who disses you is cursed, but those who show you love are blessed. 30. So basically, right after Isaac finished giving his blessing to Jacob and Jacob was just about to leave his father Isaac's side, Esau, his brother, showed up from his hunting trip. 31. He cooked up some delicious food and brought it to his father, saying, 'Dad, get up and enjoy this tasty dish I made! Then you can give me your blessing.'\" } 32. Isaac's dad was like, 'Yo, who are you?' And he answered, 'I'm your son, Esau, your OG firstborn.'\" } 33. Isaac was super shook and was like, 'Yo, who was it that hunted and brought me that meat, and I ate it all before you came, and I blessed him? Yeah, he's gonna be blessed for real.' 34. Esau totally lost it when he heard his dad's words. He just broke down and cried like never before. He desperately pleaded with his dad, saying, 'Dad, please bless me too, just like you blessed my brother.'\" } 35. And he was like, yo, your brother totally pulled a sneaky move and snatched your blessing, yo. 36. And he was like, yo, isn't his name Jacob for real? 'Cause he totally snaked me two times: first, he straight up stole my birthright, and now he's gone and swiped my blessing too. And I was like, bruh, you still got a blessing left for me or what? (By the way, Jacob means 'A supplanter', just so you know) 37. Yo, Esau, listen up. I gotta tell you something. I made Jacob your boss, yeah, for real. All his homies are his servants now. And I've been hooking him up with food and drinks. But now, dude, what should I do for you, my son? 38. And Esau was like, woah dad, you only have one blessing to give? Can you bless me too, my father? And Esau couldn't hold it in, he was all emotional and started crying. 39. Then Isaac, his dad, replied and said to him, listen up! Your place to chill will be the complete bomb, full of all the good stuff from the earth and the fresh droplets of heaven above. 40. You'll be all about the sword, livin' your life and doin' your thing, but you'll also be servin' your bro. But hey, there's gonna come a time when you'll have the upper hand and you'll be free from his control. 41. Esau totally despised Jacob 'cause their dad went and blessed him. Esau was thinkin' to himself, 'Once our old man kicks the bucket, I'm gonna knock Jacob off the face of the earth.'\" } 42. Rebekah heard what Esau, her older son, said and got in touch with Jacob, her younger son. She told him, 'Listen up, Esau is actually finding solace in the idea of taking you out.'\" } 43. So, like dude, listen up! Go and do what I'm telling you to do, okay? Get up and run over to Laban, my bro, who lives in Haran. 44. Just hang out with him for a bit, until your brother calms down and is no longer mad at you; 45. When your bro is no longer mad at you and forgets what you did to him, I'll hit you up and bring you back. I don't wanna miss out on both of you on the same day, ya know? 46. Rebekah told Isaac that she's seriously tired of dealing with the Hethite girls. She's worried that if Jacob ends up marrying one of them, it won't bring any happiness or fulfillment to her life. Like, she's just over it, you know?\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 271. And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, {here am} I. 2. And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: 3. Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me {some} venison; {take: Heb. hunt} 4. And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring {it} to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. 5. And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt {for} venison, {and} to bring {it}. 6. And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying, 7. Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death. 8. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee. 9. Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth: 10. And thou shalt bring {it} to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death. 11. And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother {is} a hairy man, and I {am} a smooth man: 12. My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. 13. And his mother said unto him, Upon me {be} thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me {them}. 14. And he went, and fetched, and brought {them} to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. 15. And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which {were} with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son: {goodly: Heb. desirable} 16. And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: 17. And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob. 18. And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here {am} I; who {art} thou, my son? 19. And Jacob said unto his father, I {am} Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. 20. And Isaac said unto his son, How {is it} that thou hast found {it} so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought {it} to me. {to me: Heb. before me} 21. And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou {be} my very son Esau or not. 22. And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice {is} Jacob's voice, but the hands {are} the hands of Esau. 23. And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him. 24. And he said, {Art} thou my very son Esau? And he said, I {am}. 25. And he said, Bring {it} near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought {it} near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank. 26. And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. 27. And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son {is} as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 28. Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: 29. Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed {be} every one that curseth thee, and blessed {be} he that blesseth thee. 30. And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 31. And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. 32. And Isaac his father said unto him, Who {art} thou? And he said, I {am} thy son, thy firstborn Esau. 33. And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where {is} he that hath taken venison, and brought {it} me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, {and} he shall be blessed. {trembled...: Heb. trembled with a great trembling greatly} {taken: Heb. hunted} 34. And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, {even} me also, O my father. 35. And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. 36. And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? {Jacob: that is, A supplanter} 37. And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? {sustained: or, supported} 38. And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, {even} me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 39. And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; {the fatness: or, of the fatness} 40. And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck. 41. And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob. 42. And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, {purposing} to kill thee. 43. Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran; 44. And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 45. Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget {that} which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? 46. And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these {which are} of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me? \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 281. So Isaac called Jacob over and gave him a blessing, and he told him in no uncertain terms, 'Dude, you better not marry any Canaanite girl, okay? Like, seriously, find someone from a different tribe.'\" } 2. Yo, get up and head to Padanaram, to the crib of Bethuel, your mom's pops. Find yourself a wife from there, one of Laban's daughters, your mom's bro. 3. And God, like, totally bless you with all the good vibes, and make you super successful, and help you grow, so that you can, like, gather a bunch of awesome people together. 4. And God's gonna hook you up with the same blessings He gave to Abraham, for you and your descendants. You're gonna inherit the land where you're just a visitor right now, the one God gave to Abraham. #nomorestrangerdanger 5. So Isaac told Jacob to leave and go to a place called Padanaram to find his uncle Laban, who was Rebekah's brother and the son of Bethuel the Syrian. Both Jacob and Esau had Rebekah as their mother. 6. When Esau peeped that Isaac had given Jacob the blessings and sent him off to find a wife from Padanaram, and on top of that, Isaac specifically told him not to marry any Canaanite girls; 7. And Jacob, like, totally listened to his dad and mom and decided to head over to Padanaram. It was all about that family love and respect, you know? 8. Esau noticed that his father Isaac didn't approve of the girls from Canaan; they weren't his vibe. 9. So, Esau went to Ishmael and married Mahalath, who was Ishmael's daughter and Abraham's grandson. Mahalath was also Nebajoth's sister. (Mahalath may also be called Bashemath.) 10. So, like, Jacob left Beersheba and headed towards Haran. (Haran is like the ancient Greek version of Charran, ya know?) 11. So, he found himself in this spot and decided to spend the night there because the sun had gone down. And since he didn't have any fancy pillows, he used some stones he found there and laid down to get some sleep. 12. So, like, he had this dream and saw a ladder, right? And this ladder was on the ground, but it stretched all the way up to heaven. And get this! There were angels of God going up and down on the ladder. Pretty surreal, huh? 13. And guess what, the LORD was standing right above it and said, 'Yo, I'm the LORD God of Abraham, your pops, and the God of Isaac. The land you're chillin' on right now? Imma give it to you and your fam.'\" } 14. And I promise that your descendants will be like grains of sand on the earth, spreading out in every direction - to the west, east, north, and south. Through you and your descendants, all the families on earth will receive blessings. 15. Yo, listen up! I'm gonna be right by your side, no matter where you go. I'll have your back and make sure you're good. And I promise, I won't bounce until I follow through on everything I've promised you. We're in this together, fam! 16. And then Jacob woke up from his nap and was like, 'Woah, God is totally here! And I didn't even realize it!' 17. And he was shook, and was like, This place is insane! This is totally God's hangout spot, the ultimate front door to heaven. 18. So Jacob woke up super early in the morning, grabbed the stone he had used as a pillow, and turned it into a cool-looking pillar. He then poured some oil on top of it. 19. And he named that place Bethel, but initially it was called Luz. Bethel means 'The house of God'. 20. So Jacob made this promise, he was like, 'Yo, if God stays by my side and protects me wherever I go, providing me with food and clothes, 21. So, like, when I get home to my dad's crib all chill and drama-free, that's when I'm gonna be all about the big man upstairs, ya know? 22. And this awesome rock that I've designated as a pillar is gonna be God's crib, you know? And no matter what cool stuff you bless me with, I'm gonna hook you up with a solid ten percent, no questions asked.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 281. And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan. 2. Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother. 3. And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people; {a multitude...: Heb. an assembly of people} 4. And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham. {wherein...: Heb. of thy sojournings} 5. And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother. 6. When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan; 7. And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Padanaram; 8. And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father; {pleased...: Heb. were evil in the eyes, etc} 9. Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. {Mahalath: or, Bashemath} 10. And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. {Haran: Gr. Charran} 11. And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put {them for} his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep. 12. And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 13. And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I {am} the LORD God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; 14. And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. {spread...: Heb. break forth} 15. And, behold, I {am} with thee, and will keep thee in all {places} whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done {that} which I have spoken to thee of. 16. And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew {it} not. 17. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful {is} this place! this {is} none other but the house of God, and this {is} the gate of heaven. 18. And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put {for} his pillows, and set it up {for} a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. 19. And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of that city {was called} Luz at the first. {Bethel: that is, The house of God} 20. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, 21. So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall the LORD be my God: 22.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 291. So Jacob flexed and started his journey, and rolled up to the land of the cool peeps from the east. {flexed...: Heb. lifted up his feet} {peeps: Heb. children} 2. So he sees, like, this well in the field and whoa, there are three groups of sheep chilling right next to it. They use that well to give water to the sheep. Oh, and there's a big stone covering the opening of the well. 3. Everyone brought their flocks together, and together they moved the big rock covering the opening of the well. They gave water to the sheep and then put the rock back in its spot. 4. Jacob asked them, 'Yo, where you guys from, fam?' And they replied, 'We're from Haran, bro.'\" } 5. He was like, 'Do you guys know Laban, Nahor's son?' And they were all like, 'Yeah, we know him!'\" } 6. And he's like, 'Hey, how's it going?' And they're all like, 'Yeah, he's good.' And guess what, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep. 7. And he was like, dude, it's still early in the day and not the right time to gather the cattle. So, take care of the sheep by giving them water and then go and feed them. 8. They were like, 'Sorry, we gotta wait until all the flocks are here and they move that big ol' rock from the well. Only then can we give water to the sheep, you know?' 9. And as he was talking to them, Rachel showed up with her dad's flock of sheep because she was the one taking care of them. 10. So, like, Jacob peeped Rachel, the daughter of his mom's bro Laban, and also noticed Laban's sheep. And Jacob got all close to the well, moved the big stone that covered it, and gave water to Laban's flock. 11. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and he couldn't hold back his emotions so he let out a cry. 12. So Jacob said to Rachel, 'Yo, I'm basically your dad's bro and Rebekah's son.' And Rachel was all like, 'OMG, I gotta spill the tea to my dad ASAP!' 13. So, like, Laban heard that his sister's son, Jacob, had arrived, and he was super stoked about it. He ran up to meet him, gave him a big hug and smooch, and invited him to his place. Then Jacob told Laban everything that had happened. #familyreunion 14. And Laban was like, duude, you’re totally my fam! So he stayed with Laban for, like, a whole month. A whole month of awesome days, bro! 15. Laban was like, 'Hey, bro, I mean, since we're fam, do I really expect you to work for free? Just curious, what do you think is a fair wage for you? Let me know.' 16. Laban had two daughters: the older one was named Leah, and the younger one was named Rachel. 17. Leah was kinda sensitive; but Rachel was stunning and had mad game. 18. Jacob was totally smitten with Rachel and was like, 'I'm down to put in a solid seven years of work just to be with your younger daughter, Rachel.'\" } 19. Laban was like, 'It's way cooler if I give her to you instead of someone else. Just hang out with me for a while.' 20. So like, Jacob totally busted his butt working for seven years just to marry Rachel, but tbh it felt like no time at all because he was head over heels for her. 21. So Jacob was like, 'Hey Laban, it's time to give me my wife. I've been waitin' for this moment, so I can finally be with her.' 22. So, like, Laban got all the dudes from the area and threw this huge party. 23. Later that night, he chose Leah to be his wife, and they became intimate together. 24. So, like, Laban gave his daughter Leah his maid Zilpah, right? And, like, Zilpah became Leah's handmaid or whatever. 25. The next morning, surprise surprise, it was Leah! And the guy was like, 'Dude, Laban! What did you just do to me? I worked my butt off for Rachel, not Leah! So why did you trick me like that?' 26. Laban was like, hold up, we don't roll like that in our hood. We can't be hookin' up the youngest sibling before the eldest. (BTW, 'country' here means placee' in Hebrew.) 27. Complete her assigned time, and we'll hook you up with something extra for the work you'll put in with me for another seven years. 28. So Jacob did that, and completed the whole week. Then he married Rachel, his daughter, too. 29. So, like, Laban, you know, he gave Bilhah, his servant, to Rachel, his daughter, to, like, be her maid and stuff. 30. And he started hanging out with Rachel too, and he totally had a major crush on her, like way more than Leah. So he ended up serving their dad for another seven whole years just to be with her. 31. And like, when the Lord peeped that Leah was not getting the love she deserved, He totally blessed her with a fertile womb, but Rachel couldn't conceive, man. 32. So, like, Leah got pregnant and had a baby boy. She named him Reuben, 'cause she was like, 'Yo, the Lord totally noticed how bummed out I was, so now my hubby will finally love me!' (BTW, Reuben means 'See a son'). 33. Then she got pregnant again and had a son. She said, 'The Lord has heard that I felt hated, so he gave me this son too.' And she named him Simeon, which means 'Hearing'. 34. Then, she got pregnant once more and gave birth to a son. She said, 'Now, finally, my husband will truly become one with me, since I've given him three sons.' That's why they named him Levi, which means 'Joined'. 35. And then she got pregnant again and had a son. She was so grateful to the LORD that she named him Judah, which means Praisee'. After that, she stopped having any more kids.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 291. Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east. {went...: Heb. lift up his feet} {people: Heb. children} 2. And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there {were} three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone {was} upon the well's mouth. 3. And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place. 4. And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence {be} ye? And they said, Of Haran {are} we. 5. And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know {him}. 6. And he said unto them, {Is} he well? And they said, {He is} well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. {Is he...: Heb. Is there peace to him?} 7. And he said, Lo, {it is} yet high day, neither {is it} time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go {and} feed {them}. {it is...: Heb. yet the day is great} 8. And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and {till} they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then we water the sheep. 9. And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she kept them. 10. And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. 11. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. 12. And Jacob told Rachel that he {was} her father's brother, and that he {was} Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father. 13. And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. {tidings: Heb. hearing} 14. And Laban said to him, Surely thou {art} my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. {the space...: Heb. a month of days} 15. And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou {art} my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what {shall} thy wages {be}? 16. And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder {was} Leah, and the name of the younger {was} Rachel. 17. Leah {was} tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. 18. And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. 19. And Laban said, {It is} better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me. 20. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him {but} a few days, for the love he had to her. 21. And Jacob said unto Laban, Give {me} my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. 22. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. 23. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. 24. And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid {for} an handmaid. 25. And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it {was} Leah: and he said to Laban, What {is} this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? 26. And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. {country: Heb. place} 27. Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. 28. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. 29. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. 30. And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. 31. And when the LORD saw that Leah {was} hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel {was} barren. 32. And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me. {Reuben: that is, See a son} 33. And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I {was} hated, he hath therefore given me this {son} also: and she called his name Simeon. {Simeon: that is, Hearing} 34. And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. {Levi: that is, Joined} 35. And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing. {Judah: that is, Praise} {left...: Heb. stood from bearing} \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 301. When Rachel saw that she couldn't have any kids and her sister could, she got really jealous and said to Jacob, 'Give me kids or I literally can't even anymore.' 2. Jacob got pretty mad at Rachel and said, 'Do I look like God? It's not me who's stopping you from having a baby, okay?' 3. Then Rachel was like, check out my girl Bilhah, go get with her and have kids with her so they can be like my own. Like, I want them to be like a family I've built with her. 4. Then she introduced him to her handmaid Bilhah as his wife, and Jacob got close to her. 5. And Bilhah got pregnant and gave birth to a son for Jacob. 6. And Rachel was like, OMG, God totally made the final verdict and actually listened to me, and now I have a little boy! So, she decided to name him Dan, which means 'Judging'. Like, it's so incredible! 7. And then Bilhah, who was Rachel's maid, got pregnant again and gave birth to another son for Jacob. 8. Rachel was like totally like, 'OMG, I had such intense battles with my sis and I totally came out on top!' So she named her baby boy Naphtali, which means 'My wrestling' (in the Greek it's Nephthalim).\" } 9. When Leah figured out she couldn't have any more kids, she decided to give her maid, Zilpah, to Jacob as his wife. 10. And Zilpah, who was Leah's helper, gave birth to a son for Jacob. 11. And Leah was like, 'Yo, a whole squad is pulling up!' So she named him Gad, which means 'a troop' or 'company'. 12. And then Leah's servant, Zilpah, gave birth to another son for Jacob. 13. Leah was like, 'Yo, this is so lit! All the girls gonna be givin' me mad respect and callin' me blessed.' So she named her son Asher, which means 'Happy'. 14. So Reuben was out during wheat harvest and stumbled upon some mandrakes in the field. He thought it would be a cool gift for his mom, Leah. Then Rachel comes up to Leah like, 'Hey, can I have some of those mandrakes that your son found? Pretty please?' 15. So, like, she said to her, 'Are you seriously not satisfied with taking my husband? Now you want to take my son's mandrakes too?' And Rachel was like, 'Fine, he can spend the night with you in exchange for the mandrakes.'\" } 16. So, like, Jacob finished his work in the field and it was getting dark outside. And Leah went out to see him, and she was like, 'Hey, come on in, we've got some business to discuss because I totally paid for your time with my son's mandrakes.' And, well, they ended up spending the night together. 17. And God listened to Leah, and she got pregnant and gave birth to Jacob's fifth son. 18. Leah was like, 'Yasss, God hooked me up with my reward because I blessed my man with my girl.' So, she named him Issachar, which means 'a reward.'\" } 19. And then Leah got pregnant again and gave birth to Jacob's sixth son. 20. Leah was stoked, like, God hooked me up with a sick dowry. Now my hubby will totally chill with me 'cause I've given him six sons. And she named the kid Zebulun, which means 'Dwelling'. (Zebulun: that's his name in Greek, means Dwelling) 21. And then she had a daughter and named her Dinah. {Dinah: which means Judgment} 22. And God was like, 'Oh hey, Rachel!' and really listened to her, and made it so she could finally have a baby. 23. And she got pregnant and gave birth to a son. She said, God has removed the shame from my life. 24. So she named him Joseph and said, Godd will bless me with another son.'\" } 25. So, like, after Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob was all like, 'Yo Laban, I'm ready to bounce. Send me back to my home turf, you know, where I belong.' 26. Yo, just give me my wifey and kids, man. I've been grindin' for you, you feel me? Let me bounce, 'cause you know I been puttin' in that work for you. 27. Laban was like, 'Yo, listen up. If I've totally won your favor, please don't jet just yet. I've peeped that thanks to you, the Lord has been hooking me up with blessings. No cap! 28. And he was like, 'Tell me how much you want to get paid, and I'll make sure you get it.'\" } 29. And he was like, yo, you know how I've been grinding for you, and how your animals were all good under my watch. 30. You didn't have much before I came, but now you have a ton of stuff. The LORD has blessed you since I arrived. So, when can I start taking care of my own house too? 31. And he was like, 'Yo, what can I offer you?' And Jacob was like, 'Nah, you don't gotta give me anything. But if you could do me a solid and help me out with this, I'll look after and take care of your flock, bro.'\" } 32. Today, I'll go through your whole crew and take out all the cool-looking cows and sheep that have unique patterns and colors. And I'll make sure to keep the ones with cool colors and patterns among the goats too. That's gonna be my payment. 33. In the future, my righteousness will speak for me and prove my innocence before you, like when I get paid. Anyone who isn't speckled or spotted among the goats, or brown among the sheep, will be considered stolen along with me. 34. And Laban was like, 'Yo, I'm down with what you're saying. I hope things go the way you said they would.'\" } 35. And on that day, he decided to separate the ringstraked and spotted he-goats and the speckled and spotted she-goats, plus any with a touch of white, and all the brown sheep, and gave them to his sons to take care of. 36. So he put a three-day distance between himself and Jacob, and Jacob took care of the rest of Laban's flocks. 37. So Jacob grabbed some branches from green poplar, hazel, and chestnut trees and peeled off strips to make the white part of the branches show. 38. Then he placed the stripped branches in the water troughs where the flocks went to quench their thirst, so that they would get pregnant when they came to drink. 39. And the sheep got pregnant before the striped and spotted sticks, and gave birth to cows with stripes, spots, and speckles. 40. So, Jacob like, separated the cute little lambs and made sure the flocks looked at the cool spotty ones and the brown ones in Laban's flock. He made sure his own flocks were separate from Laban's. No mingling allowed! 41. So, like, when the big, strong cattle were getting pregnant, Jacob placed these sticks in front of the cattle's eyes in the ditches so that they would get pregnant when they were near the sticks. 42. But when the cows were weak, he didn't put them with the rest. So the weaker ones were Laban's and the stronger ones belonged to Jacob. 43. And this dude totally thrived and had an insane amount of livestock, plus a whole crew of awesome maids and dudes, not to mention loads of camels and donkeys.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 301. And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die. 2. And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, {Am} I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb? 3. And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. {have...: Heb. be built by her} 4. And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her. 5. And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son. 6. And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan. {Dan: that is, Judging} 7. And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son. 8. And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali. {great...: Heb. wrestlings of God} {Naphtali: that is, My wrestling: Gr. Nephthalim} 9. When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife. 10. And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son. 11. And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad. {Gad: that is, A troop, or, company} 12. And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son. 13. And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher. {Happy...: Heb. In my happiness} {Asher: that is, Happy} 14. And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. 15. And she said unto her, {Is it} a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. 16. And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. 17. And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son. 18. And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar. {Issachar: that is, An hire} 19. And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son. 20. And Leah said, God hath endued me {with} a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun. {Zebulun: that is, Dwelling: Gr. Zabulon} 21. And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah. {Dinah: that is Judgment} 22. And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. 23. And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: 24. And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son. {Joseph: that is, Adding} 25. And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. 26. Give {me} my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee. 27. And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, {tarry: for} I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake. 28. And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give {it}. 29. And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me. 30. For {it was} little which thou hadst before I {came}, and it is {now} increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also? {increased: Heb. broken forth} {since...: Heb. at my foot} 31. And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed {and} keep thy flock: 32. I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and {of such} shall be my hire. 33. So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that {is} not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me. {in time...: Heb. to morrow} 34. And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. 35. And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, {and} every one that had {some} white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave {them} into the hand of his sons. 36. And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks. 37. And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which {was} in the rods. 38. And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. 39. And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. 40. And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle. 41. And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. 42. But when the cattle were feeble, he put {them} not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's. 43. And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 311. And, like, he heard what Laban's sons were saying, like, 'Dude, Jacob totally took everything that belonged to our dad, and, like, he gained all this fame and success from what belonged to our dad.' 2. So Jacob saw Laban's face and noticed that it wasn't the same as before. It wasn't all friendly and chill like it used to be. It was kinda awkward, you know? Like things have definitely changed. 3. God was like, 'Yo Jacob, it's time to head back to your family turf. I'll roll with you every step of the way.'\" } 4. So Jacob hit up Rachel and Leah and told them to come out to the field where his sheep were at, 5. And I was like, yo, I noticed how your dad's vibes towards me have changed. But the God my dad worships, He's been with me, you know? 6. And y'all know that I've dedicated all my energy in serving your dad. 7. And my dad totally played me, constantly changing up my pay like ten times, but God didn't let him mess with me. 8. He was like, 'If he said, 'Yo, you gonna get speckled animals as your wages,' then all the cattle had spots. But if he was like, 'Nah, you gonna get ringstraked animals as your pay,' then all the cattle had stripes. 9. So, like, God totally took your dad's livestock and gave it to me. 10. So, like, while the cows were getting ready to have babies, I like, looked up and had this dream. And, yo, check it out, the male sheep that were jumping on the cows, they had these cool patterns - like, some were striped, some were spotted, and some were all mixed up and speckled. Oh, and by the way, when I say 'rams,' I really mean malee goats,' just keeping it real. 11. So, like, this angel from God came to me in this dream, and he starts talking to me, calling me Jacob. And I'm just like, yo, here I am. 12. And he was like, yo, check it out, look up and see, all the rams that are jumpin' on the cattle, they're all striped, spotted, and speckled. It's 'cause I've been peepin' Laban and all the shady stuff he's been pullin' on you. 13. I'm the whole vibe of Bethel, where you did your thing with the pillar, and made a big promise to me. But now it's time to bounce from this place and go back to where your fam is at. 14. Rachel and Leah replied, 'Do we still have any share or inheritance left in our dad's crib?' 15. Don't we feel like outsiders to him? He totally treated us like shoppers, and, man, he totally swiped all our cash too. 16. Like, all the stuff God took from our dad, it totally belongs to us and our kids too. So, if God said something to you, just do it, you know? 17. So Jacob got up and helped his sons and wives onto camels; 18. And he took all his animals and possessions that he had acquired, the animals he had acquired in Padanaram, to bring them to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan. 19. Laban was out shearing his sheep and Rachel took her dad's statues. (Note: teraphim means statues in Hebrew) 20. So, Jacob decided to sneak off without telling Laban the Syrian that he was leaving. Laban had no idea that Jacob had dipped out. 21. Then he ran away with all his stuff, and he went across the river and headed towards Mount Gilead. 22. Laban found out three days later that Jacob had escaped. 23. And he took his squad with him, and started chasing after him for a whole week; and finally caught up to him in the epic Mount Gilead. 24. So, like, God appeared to Laban – this Syriac dude – in a dream, right? And He was all like, 'Listen up, Laban! Don't you dare say anything good or bad to Jacob, okay?' 25. So, Laban caught up with Jacob. Just to give you the deets, Jacob had set up his crib on the mountain. And guess what? Laban and his homies also set up camp on the mountain of Gilead. 26. Laban was like, yo Jacob, what's up with you sneaking off without me knowing and taking my daughters away like you just raided them with a sword? 27. Why did you leave without saying anything, sneaking away from me and not giving me a chance to bid you farewell with joy, music, and celebration? 28. And you didn't let me give a proper goodbye kiss to my sons and daughters? That was a pretty dumb move on your part. 29. I totally could've messed you up, but Jacob's dad's God dropped me a message last night, telling me to keep my mouth shut when it comes to talking about Jacob, whether it's good or bad. So yeah, I won't mess with him. 30. And now, even though you really wanted to go back to your father's house, why did you take my gods? 31. And Jacob was like, 'Dude, I spoke up to Laban 'cause I was low-key scared, ya know? I had this feeling in my gut that he might straight up snatch his daughters away from me, no cap.'\" } 32. If you find your gods with anyone, don't let them live; first, figure out what belongs to you and take it back. Jacob didn't realize that Rachel had taken them. 33. So Laban checked out Jacob's tent, then Leah's tent, and even the tents of the two maidservants, but he couldn't find them anywhere. So he left Leah's tent and went straight into Rachel's tent. 34. Okay, so Rachel had discreetly grabbed those images and cleverly hidden them among the camel's stuff, just to throw everyone off. Then she casually plopped herself down on top of them. Well, Laban was pretty determined to find those things, so he thoroughly checked every nook and cranny of the entire tent. But he couldn't find them anywhere. (By the way, when it says 'searched' it actually means Laban was basically feeling around for them.) 35. So she told her dad, \"Please don't be upset that I can't get up in front of you, cause, you know, it's that time of the month for me. And he looked around, but couldn't find the stuff he was looking for. 36. Jacob got really mad and started arguing with Laban: he said to Laban, 'What did I do wrong? What sin did I commit that you're coming after me so aggressively?' 37. So, you've gone through all my things, but what have you actually found that belongs to you? Bring it here, right in front of our friends and family, so they can decide who it really belongs to. 🧐 38. Bruh, I've been by your side for a hot minute, like, twenty years straight. And guess what? Your ewes and she goats haven't had any miscarriages, and I haven't even touched those rams from your flock. No cap. 39. I didn't bring any torn stuff from animals to you, I took the loss upon myself. You demanded it from me, whether it was stolen during the day or at night. 40. Like, it was totally rough. I mean, during the day I was so parched, like everything was dry and there was no water to be found. And then at night, it was freezing cold, like frosty, you know? And on top of all that, I couldn't even catch a wink of sleep, man. It was straight up gone from my eyes. 41. So, like, I've spent, like, a whole two decades working for you, man. I mean, I slaved away for, like, fourteen years just to marry your two daughters, and then another six years, like, taking care of your livestock. And, dude, you changed my paycheck, like, ten freaking times! Can you even believe it? 42. If it wasn't for the God my dad, the God of Abraham, and the respect for Isaac, I would have definitely been kicked out without anything. God saw the hard times I went through and the work I put in, and gave you a real talking-to last night. 43. Laban replied to Jacob, 'Bro, these girls are my girls, these kids are my kids, and all these animals are mine too. Everything you see here belongs to me. So, what can I do today to bless these girls and their children?' 44. So, like, let's make a deal, you and me. It'll be, like, a special bond that shows we're, you know, in this together. 45. So Jacob grabbed a stone and placed it there as a monument. 46. So Jacob said to his bros, 'Yo, let's gather some rocks.' And they were like, 'Sure, cool,' and gathered rocks and made a big pile. Then, they all sat on the pile and had a chill meal together. 47. Laban named it Jegarsahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. (Jegarsahadutha means 'heap of witness' in Chaldee, while Galeed means 'heap of witness' in Hebrew.) 48. Laban was like, yo, this big pile of rocks is a legit witness between us today. So, we're gonna call it Galeed, just so we remember this all happened. 49. And Mizpah, you know? 'Cause like, I'm saying, may the LORD look out for us when we're not together, you feel me? Mizpah, it's like a symbol of being able to keep an eye out, like a beacon or a watchtower. 50. If you mess with my daughters or try to marry other women besides them, it's just gonna be me and you, no one else. God is watching everything between us, no doubt about it. 51. Laban was like, 'Yo, check out this dope stack of rocks and this sick pillar I set up between you and me, Jacob.' 52. Yo, check it. This pile right here, and this rock right here, they're legit proof that I won't trespass onto your turf, and you won't come over to mine, with any ill intentions or negativity. 53. May the Supreme Being of Abraham and Nahor, the Supreme Being of their father, mediate between us. And Jacob solemnly affirmed by the reverence for his father Isaac. 54. So Jacob went ahead and made a big feast on the mountain, inviting all his peeps to come chill and grub with him. They had a good meal together and decided to crash there for the night on the mountain. #GoodVibesOnly 55. The next morning, Laban got up, gave his sons and daughters a goodbye kiss, and blessed them. Then Laban said his goodbyes and went back home.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 311. And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that {was} our father's; and of {that} which {was} our father's hath he gotten all this glory. 2. And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it {was} not toward him as before. {as before: Heb. as yesterday and the day before} 3. And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee. 4. And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 5. And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it {is} not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been with me. 6. And ye know that with all my power I have served your father. 7. And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me. 8. If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked. 9. Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given {them} to me. 10. And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle {were} ringstraked, speckled, and grisled. {rams: or, he goats} 11. And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, {saying}, Jacob: And I said, Here {am} I. 12. And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle {are} ringstraked, speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee. 13. I {am} the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, {and} where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred. 14. And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, {Is there} yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 15. Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money. 16. For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that {is} ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do. 17. Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon camels; 18. And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. 19. And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the images that {were} her father's. {images: Heb. teraphim} 20. And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled. {unawares...: Heb. the heart of Laban} 21. So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face {toward} the mount Gilead. 22. And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled. 23. And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead. 24. And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. {either...: Heb. from good to bad} 25. Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead. 26. And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as captives {taken} with the sword? 27. Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp? {steal...: Heb. hast stolen me} 28. And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in {so} doing. 29. It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad. 30. And now, {though} thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, {yet} wherefore hast thou stolen my gods? 31. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me. 32. With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what {is} thine with me, and take {it} to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. 33. And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the two maidservants' tents; but he found {them} not. Then went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. 34. Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent, but found {them} not. {searched: Heb. felt} 35. And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women {is} upon me. And he searched, but found not the images. 36. And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What {is} my trespass? what {is} my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me? 37. Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set {it} here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both. {searched: Heb. felt} 38. This twenty years {have} I {been} with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. 39. That which was torn {of beasts} I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, {whether} stolen by day, or stolen by night. 40. {Thus} I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes. 41. Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times. 42. Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked {thee} yesternight. 43. And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, {These} daughters {are} my daughters, and {these} children {are} my children, and {these} cattle {are} my cattle, and all that thou seest {is} mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children which they have born? 44. Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee. 45. And Jacob took a stone, and set it up {for} a pillar. 46. And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the heap. 47. And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it Galeed. {Jegarsahadutha: that is, The heap of witness, Chaldee} {Galeed: that is, The heap of witness, Heb.} 48. And Laban said, This heap {is} a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed; 49. And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another. {Mizpah: that is, A beacon, or, watchtower} 50. If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take {other} wives beside my daughters, no man {is} with us; see, God {is} witness betwixt me and thee. 51. And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold {this} pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee; 52. This heap {be} witness, and {this} pillar {be} witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm. 53. The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac. 54. Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mount. {offered...: or, killed beasts} 55. And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 321. So Jacob was just doing his thing, when he bumped into some angels sent by God. 2. And when Jacob peeped them, he was like, yo, this is straight up God's squad right here. So he named that spot Mahanaim, which means two crews or two camps. 3. So Jacob DM'd some messengers to Esau, his bro, in the land of Seir, the place where Edom was. {country: Hebrew for field} 4. So, like, he told them to, like, talk to my dude Esau and be all respectful and stuff. Jacob, your bro, is like, 'Yo, I've been crashing at Laban's place for a while, but now I'm here, ya know?' 5. So, like, I have these oxen, asses, flocks, and a bunch of people working for me, you know? And I just wanted to let my lord know, because I'm all about that honesty and respect, that I hope I can earn your favor and be on your good side. 6. Yo, the messengers went back to Jacob and were like, 'We found your bro Esau, and guess what? He's heading towards you with a crew of four hundred dudes.'\" } 7. So Jacob got really scared and stressed out. He split up his crew, along with their flocks, herds, and camels, into two groups. 8. And he was like, if Esau pulls up on one group and starts wrecking them, then the other group that's left will be able to make a clean getaway. 9. Jacob was like, yo God, the one my pops Abraham and Isaac worshipped, you know that guy who told me to go back home to my fam and promised to hook me up? 10. I can't even begin to express how grateful I am for all the kindness and truth you've shown me. From the bottom of my heart, I am blown away by your blessings. Coming from such humble beginnings, I've managed to overcome obstacles and now I've become successful in two different areas of my life. (To think, I actually believed I was the lowest of the low, but now I realize I was even worse than that.) 11. Yo, please save me from my bro Esau, 'cause I'm scared he's gonna straight up hit me and the whole fam. No cap. 12. And you were like, 'I got you, I'll totally hook you up and make your fam as countless as the sand on the beach.'\" } 13. So, like, he stayed there overnight and, you know, grabbed some of his stuff to give as a gift to his bro Esau. 14. So, like, they had 200 she goats, and 20 he goats, you know? And also, there were 200 ewes, along with 20 rams, man! 15. Like, there were 30 camels that could produce milk, along with their cute little babies. And there were 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 baby donkeys. How cool is that?! 16. Then he gave the animals to his workers, instructing them to split them up into separate groups. He said to his workers, 'Go ahead of me and leave a gap between each group.'\" } 17. Then he told the first guy, 'Yo, when Esau, my bro, sees you, he's gonna ask you like, who the heck are you? Where are you headed? And who are all these people with you?' 18. So like, you should totally be like, 'Yo, these are like the gifts from your boy Jacob, my dude. It's a little something I'm sending to my bro Esau. Oh, and just to let you know, he's still chilling behind us.'\" } 19. So, he told the second, the third, and everyone else in the group, saying, 'This is how you should talk to Esau when you see him.'\" } 20. And let me just add, like, check it out, our boy Jacob is right behind us. 'Cause he was like, yo, I'll bring him a gift before I show up, and maybe then he'll be cool with me and accept me, you know what I mean? 21. So the gift was given to him in advance, and he stayed overnight with the crew. 22. So, like, this guy got up in the middle of the night and, like, took his two wives, two women who were serving him, and his eleven sons, and, you know, crossed over this place called the ford Jabbok. 23. So he gathered them up and made them cross the stream, along with all they had. {caused to pass: Hebrew meaning sent them} 24. So Jacob found himself all by himself, when suddenly a man came and started wrestling with him. They wrestled all the way until the morning sun began to rise. 25. But since he couldn't defeat Jacob, he decided to play dirty and gave him a sneaky swipe at the thigh. This move messed up Jacob's thigh and put it out of joint while they were wrestling. 26. And he was like, bro, it's getting light out, so lemme bounce. But the other guy was like, nah dude, I'm not lettin' you go unless you give me a blessing, yo. 27. Then he asked him, 'Yo, what's your name?' And he replied, 'I'm Jacob.'\" } 28. And he was like, dude, you're not gonna be called Jacob anymore, but Israel. Because you've got this total power move with God and with people, and you've totally won. Israel means, like, a prince of God, by the way. 29. So Jacob was like, 'Hey dude, what's your name?' And the guy was like, 'Why do you wanna know?' But then he blessed Jacob right then and there. 30. And Jacob was like, 'Yo, I'mma name this place Peniel, 'cause I straight up saw God face to face, and I'm alive and kickin', man. Peniel means 'The face of God,' in case you were wondering. 31. And as he was walking through Penuel, the sun came up, and he stopped and started limping. 32. So, like, the Israelites still don't eat this specific part of the animal, you know, the sinew that shrank that's on the thigh. They've been doing this since the time when Jacob's thigh got touched and the sinew shrank.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 321. And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him. 2. And when Jacob saw them, he said, This {is} God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim. {Mahanaim: that is, Two hosts, or, camps} 3. And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom. {country: Heb. field} 4. And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now: 5. And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight. 6. And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him. 7. Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the people that {was} with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands; 8. And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall escape. 9. And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: 10. I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands. {I am not...: Heb. I am less than all} 11. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, {and} the mother with the children. {with: Heb. upon} 12. And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude. 13. And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother; 14. Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams, 15. Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals. 16. And he delivered {them} into the hand of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove. 17. And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose {art} thou? and whither goest thou? and whose {are} these before thee? 18. Then thou shalt say, {They be} thy servant Jacob's; it {is} a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he {is} behind us. 19. And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. 20. And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob {is} behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. {of me: Heb. my face} 21. So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. 22. And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. 23. And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. {sent them: Heb. caused to pass} 24. And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. {breaking...: Heb. ascending of the morning} 25. And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. 26. And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. 27. And he said unto him, What {is} thy name? And he said, Jacob. 28. And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. {Israel: that is, A prince of God} 29. And Jacob asked {him}, and said, Tell {me}, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore {is} it {that} thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. 30. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. {Peniel: that is, The face of God} 31. And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. 32. Therefore the children of Israel eat not {of} the sinew which shrank, which {is} upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew that shrank. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 331. So Jacob glanced up and saw that Esau was approaching with four hundred guys. Then he sorted out his children, giving some to Leah, some to Rachel, and some to the two maid servants. 2. And he made sure the handmaids and their kids were in the front, followed by Leah and her kids, and Rachel and Joseph were at the back. 3. Then he walked up in front of them, and respectfully bowed down to the ground seven times, until he got close to his brother. 4. And Esau quickly went up to meet Jacob, giving him a big hug, holding him close, and planting a heartfelt kiss on his cheek. They couldn't help but shed tears of joy together. 5. Then he looked up and saw the women and children, and he asked, 'Who are these people with you?' And he replied, 'They are the children that God has blessed me with.'\" } 6. After that, the handmaidens approached, along with their children, and they humbly bowed down. 7. Then Leah and her squad rolled up and showed some respect. And right after, Joseph and Rachel stepped up and paid their respects too. 8. And he was like, 'Yo, bro, what's up with all these animals I came across?' And the guy was like, 'I brought them to gain favor with my lord, dude.' So, the guy was basically asking why the other dude had a bunch of animals with him. 9. Esau was like, yo bro, I'm good. Keep whatever you got for yourself. 10. And Jacob was like, yo, if I'm chillin' with you and you think I'm cool, can you accept this gift from me? 'Cause when I see you, it's like I'm seeing God, and you're vibin' with me. 11. Yo, dude, please accept this blessing I'm bringing you. It's all good, 'cause God has been so kind to me, and I'm totally content with what I have. I insist, bro, take it. It's all yours. 12. And he was like, 'Yo, let's hit the road and go on this journey together, and I'll lead the way, fam. 13. And he said to him, Bro, you know that the younglings and the lil' animals are delicate out here. If we push 'em too hard for even just a day, the whole crew could end up wiped out. 14. Yo, my dude, please let me go ahead of you at a slow pace, so that I can make sure the animals and the kids can handle it until I reach you in Seir. Gonna match their speed and stamina, you know what I mean? 15. Esau was like, 'Hey, can some of my crew roll with you?' But Jacob was all like, 'No need, bro. Just let me earn your favor, yo.'\" } 16. So Esau went back that day on his journey to Seir. 17. So Jacob went to Succoth and built himself a sick house, and made some cozy spots for his animals. That's why the place is called Succoth, which means booths. 18. So Jacob arrived in Shalem, a cool city in Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, after travelling all the way from Padanaram. He set up his tent right outside the city. (Fun fact: Shechem is also known as Sychem in Greek!) 19. So, he decided to buy a piece of land, where he had set up his tent, from the descendants of Hamor, who was Shechem's dad. He paid a hundred pieces of money for it. (Hamor is also known as Emmor, and by 'pieces of money' they mean lambs.) 20. Then he set up an altar and named it Elelohe-Israel. (Elelohe-Israel means God, the God of Israel)\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 331. And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids. 2. And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 3. And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 4. And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept. 5. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who {are} those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant. {with...: Heb. to thee} 6. Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves. 7. And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves. 8. And he said, What {meanest} thou by all this drove which I met? And he said, {These are} to find grace in the sight of my lord. {What...: Heb. What is all this band to thee?} 9. And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast unto thyself. {keep...: Heb. be that to thee that is thine} 10.

Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took {it}. {enough: Heb. all things} 12. And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee. 13. And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children {are} tender, and the flocks and herds with young {are} with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die. 14. Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my lord unto Seir. {according...: Heb. according to the foot of the work, etc., and according to the foot of the children} 15.

And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. {Succoth: that is, Booths} 18. And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which {is} in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city. {Shechem: Gr. Sychem} 19.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 341. So, Dinah, who was Leah's daughter and Jacob's child, decided to check out the local girls. 2. So, like, Shechem, this dude from the Hivite crew, who was, like, the boss of that area, saw her and straight-up took her and hooked up with her, totally disrespecting her. (BTW, 'defiled' means, like, he humbled her, just saying.) 3. And he was really into Dinah, Jacob's daughter. He had mad love for her and treated her with so much respect and affection. 4. So Shechem went to his dad Hamor and said, 'Yo, hook me up with that girl as my wifey.'\" } 5. So, Jacob found out that someone had disrespected his daughter, Dinah. At that time, his sons were out in the field taking care of their animals. Jacob kept quiet about it until they came back. 6. So Hamor, Shechem's dad, went to hang out with Jacob and have a chat. 7. And when Jacob's boys came back from the outdoor hangout and found out about it, they were really upset and mad. They couldn't believe that this dude had done something so dumb as sleeping with Jacob's daughter. That's totally not cool and definitely not something you should do. 8. So Hamor was talking to them and he said, 'My son Shechem is totally into your daughter. I hope you consider letting them get together.'\" } 9. So, like, let's, you know, join families and have relationships. Give us your daughters and we'll give you ours, you feel? 10. And you can totally live with us, and the land is yours to explore and settle in. Feel free to set up shop and make a living here, gaining all the stuff you need. 11. And Shechem was like, yo, pops and bros, please chill with me and if you're cool with me, I'll hook you up with whatever you want. 12. If you want a big dowry or lots of gifts, just tell me what you want and I'll give it, but all I ask in return is to marry the girl. 13. So, like, Jacob's boys, they totally gave Shechem and Hamor, his dad, a fake response, you know? They were all upset 'cause Shechem had, like, disrespected their sister, Dinah: 14. And they told them, 'Sorry, but we can't do that. We can't give our sister to someone who hasn't been circumcised. It would bring shame upon us.'\" } 15. But here's the deal, we're cool with you, as long as you're cool with us. If you're down to do what we do, then all the guys among you gotta get circumcised, ya know? 16. So, like, we'll totally hook you up with our daughters, and you can hook us up with your daughters, and we'll chill together and become one big fam. 17. But if you guys don't listen and get circumcised, then we'll just leave with our daughter. 18. And what they said made Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son, pretty stoked. 19. And the young man didn't hesitate to do it, because he really liked Jacob's daughter. Plus, he was even more respected than anyone else in his father's household. 20. So, Hamor and his son Shechem went to the city gate and had a chat with all the dudes in their city. They were like, 21. These dudes are chill with us, so let's let them hang around in our hood and do business there. The land is big enough for all of us, you know? We can marry their daughters and they can marry ours, like a cool mix and match situation. 22. So, like, the deal is, these guys are cool with joining our squad and being one of us, but only if all of our dudes get circumcised, you know, like they are. 23. Yo, shouldn't we, like, totally claim their livestock, their possessions, and all their animals as ours? We just gotta make a deal with them, and they'll totally live among us, no problem. 24. So, like, all the dudes who lived in Hamor and Shechem's city were totally down for what they had to say. And, get this, they all decided to get circumcised! Every single one of them, no joke. 25. So, like, on the third day, when they were super upset, Simeon and Levi, the brothers of Dinah, they grabbed their swords and straight up went to the city without fear, and like, they killed all the guys there. 26. So, they killed Hamor and Shechem's son by going all in with their sword, snatched Dinah from Shechem's place, and bounced. {edge: (original Hebrew means 'mouth')}\"}\n",
      " 27. The bros of Jacob found out what went down and looted the city as payback for what they did to their sis. No respect, man. 28. So, like, they gathered up all their sheep, oxen, and donkeys, along with everything they had in the city and in the fields. 29. And they captured all of their belongings, including their children, wives, and everything that was in their house. 30. Jacob was like, 'Yo, Simeon and Levi, you totally messed things up! You made me look bad in front of the people in this land, the Canaanites and Perizzites. Because of your actions, they're gonna gather up against me and my crew, and probably end up killing us. We're totally gonna get wiped out! 31. And they were like, um, should he treat our sis like some kind of party girl?\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 341. And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 2. And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her. {defiled...: Heb. humbled her} 3. And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel. {kindly...: Heb. to the heart of the damsel} 4. And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife. 5. And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they were come. 6. And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him. 7. And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard {it}: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done. 8. And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to wife. 9. And make ye marriages with us, {and} give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you. 10. And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein. 11. And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give. 12. Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife. 13. And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their sister: 14. And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that {were} a reproach unto us: 15. But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we {be}, that every male of you be circumcised; 16. Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people. 17. But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone. 18. And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son. 19. And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he {was} more honourable than all the house of his father. 20. And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, 21. These men {are} peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, {it is} large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters. 22. Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us, to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they {are} circumcised. 23. {Shall} not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs {be} ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us. 24. And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city. 25. And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males. 26. And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out. {edge: Heb. mouth} 27. The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city, because they had defiled their sister. 28. They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and that which {was} in the city, and that which {was} in the field, 29. And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that {was} in the house. 30. And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I {being} few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house. 31. And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot? \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 351. Yo, Jacob, listen up! God said to get up and head over to Bethel. Settle down there and build an altar to honor God, the one who showed up when you were running away from your bro, Esau. 2. Then Jacob was like, yo, listen up everyone in his crew. We gotta ditch those sketchy gods you got hidden in your stuff. Time to purify ourselves and put on some fresh threads, ya know? 3. So, let's get up and head to Bethel. There, I'm gonna build an altar for God, who totally had my back when things got rough and stuck with me every step of the way. 4. So they handed over to Jacob all the gods they had, you know, those foreign ones, and also their cool earrings they had in their ears. And Jacob, being all smart about it, he hid them under this oak tree that was by Shechem. 5. So they kept moving, and the awe-inspiring power of God fell upon the neighboring cities, causing them not to chase after Jacob's sons. 6. So Jacob went to Luz, which is in Canaan, also known as Bethel, with all his crew that were with him. 7. And he made, like, this sick altar there and named the place Elbethel, ‘cause that's where God showed up to him when he was running away from his bro. Elbethel, like, means the God of Bethel or something. 8. Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, sadly passed away and her final resting place was beneath a beautiful oak tree near Bethel. This sacred oak tree was given the name Allonbachuth, meaning 'The oak of weeping', as a tribute to her memory. 9. So like, God showed up to Jacob once again, right after he left Padanaram, and totally blessed him. 10. So, God was like, 'Hey, dude! From now on, you're gonna be called Israel, not Jacob. That's gonna be your new name.' And he actually changed his name to Israel. 11. And God was like, yo dude, I'm God Almighty - no one can top me. So here's the deal: have lots of kids, build a whole nation, even multiple nations, and some legit kings are gonna come from your bloodline, bro. 12. And yo, that land I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I'm gonna give it to you, and to your homies after you. It's gonna be their turf too. 13. And God bounced from him at the spot where they had a chat. 14. So Jacob placed a cool-looking stone thingy where he had a deep convo with God. And he poured some fruity drink and trendy oil on it, you know, to show his respect and gratitude. 15. So Jacob named the place where God spoke to him Bethel. 16. So they left Bethel and it wasn't too far until they reached Ephrath. And let me tell you, Rachel was going through it - she was in intense pain and laboring hard. It wasn't an easy situation, that's for sure.  17. So, while she was going through a really tough time giving birth, the midwife reassured her, like, 'Don't stress, don't worry. You're gonna have another son.'\" } 18. As she took her last breath and passed away, she decided to name her baby boy Benoni, which means 'The son of my sorrow.' However, his father renamed him Benjamin, which means 'The son of the right hand.' 19. And, like, Rachel passed away and they laid her to rest on the road to Ephrath, which is, like, Bethlehem. 20. So Jacob placed a monument on Rachel's grave. It's still there to this day, known as Rachel's monument. 21. So Israel moved on and set up his tent past the tower of Edar. 22. So, like, while Israel was living in that place, Reuben, one of Jacob's sons, hooked up with Bilhah, who was, like, his dad's concubine. And, man, Jacob found out about it. Just so you know, Jacob had twelve sons in total: 23. Here are Leah's kids: Reuben, the oldest, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 24. Rachel had two sons named Joseph and Benjamin: 25. And Rachel, like, had these two kids through her handmaid Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali, ya know? 26. And the sons of Zilpah, who was Leah's BFF; Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him during his time in Padanaram. 27. So Jacob went to his dad Isaac in Hebron, which is also called Mamre, the same place where Abraham and Isaac had stayed for a while. 28. Isaac lived for like, a super long time, you know? He reached the epic age of a hundred and eighty years. Can you believe it?! 29. And Isaac passed away peacefully, and he died, joining his ancestors, as an elder who lived a long and fulfilling life. His sons Esau and Jacob laid him to rest with reverence.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 351. And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother. 2. Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that {were} with him, Put away the strange gods that {are} among you, and be clean, and change your garments: 3. And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went. 4. And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which {were} in their hand, and {all their} earrings which {were} in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which {was} by Shechem. 5. And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities that {were} round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob. 6. So Jacob came to Luz, which {is} in the land of Canaan, that {is}, Bethel, he and all the people that {were} with him. 7. And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother. {Elbethel: that is, The God of Bethel} 8. But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth. {Allonbachuth: that is, The oak of weeping} 9. And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him. 10. And God said unto him, Thy name {is} Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel. 11. And God said unto him, I {am} God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; 12. And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land. 13. And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him. 14. And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, {even} a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon. 15. And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Bethel. 16. And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour. {a little...: Heb. a little piece of ground} 17. And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also. 18. And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin. {Benoni: that is, The son of my sorrow} {Benjamin: that is, The son of the right hand} 19. And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which {is} Bethlehem. 20. And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that {is} the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day. 21. And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar. 22. And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard {it}. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: 23. The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: 24. The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: 25. And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: 26. And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these {are} the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram. 27. And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which {is} Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. 28. And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years. 29. And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, {being} old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 361. So, here's the deal: let's talk about Esau, who's also known as Edom. Here's his backstory, fam. 2. Esau married women from the Canaanite families. He married Adah, who was a daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah, who was a daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite. 3. And Bashemath, who was Ishmael's daughter and Nebajoth's sister. {Bashemath: or, Mahalath} 4. And Adah had a son named Eliphaz with Esau, while Bashemath had a son named Reuel. 5. So, Aholibamah had Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. These are the kids of Esau that were born to him when he was living in Canaan. 6. So Esau gathered up his wives, kids, and everyone in his household, along with his livestock, pets, and all his possessions that he had acquired in Canaan. He decided to move away to a different place to avoid his brother Jacob's presence. (Note: 'persons' in Hebrew means 'souls')\" } 7. Their wealth was too great for them to live in harmony, and the land where they had settled couldn't sustain them and their livestock. 8. So Esau made his home in Mount Seir, and he became known as Edom. 9. So, here's the rundown of Esau, he's the big guy who fathered the Edomites, you know, those peeps living in mount Seir. Oh, FYI, Edomites means Edom in Hebrew. 10. Here's a list of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, who was born to Adah, Esau's wife, and Reuel, who was born to Bashemath, Esau's other wife. 11. Eliphaz had sons named Teman, Omar, Zepho (also known as Zephi), Gatam, and Kenaz. 12. Timna was kinda like a side piece to Eliphaz, who was Esau's son. And she ended up having a kid with Eliphaz named Amalek. So basically, Amalek was one of the sons of Adah, who was actually Esau's wife. 13. So, Reuel had a crew of sons: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. They were all from Bashemath, Esau's wifey. 14. These are the kids of Aholibamah, who was Anah's daughter and Zibeon's granddaughter. Aholibamah was Esau's wife and she gave birth to Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. 15. These were the OG leaders of Esau's crew: Eliphaz, Esau's oldest bro, was the top dawg. He had his homies Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Kenaz as his right-hand men. 16. Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these were the leaders who came from Eliphaz in the land of Edom; they were the sons of Adah. 17. These are the guys Reuel, who is Esau's son, had: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah were like the bosses. They were the important dudes in Reuel's crew in the land of Edom. Bashemath, who was Esau's wife, had these sons. 18. And these are the guys that Aholibamah, Esau's wife, had: Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. They were the leaders who descended from Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah and Esau's wife. 19. So, these are the descendants of Esau, commonly known as Edom, and these are their leaders. 20. These dudes were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in that land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, and Anah, 21. And there were Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan: they were the big shots of the Horites, the children of Seir from the land of Edom. 22. The kids of Lotan were Hori and Hemam, and Lotan had a sister named Timna. Hemam can also be called Homam. 23. And Shobal had these cool kids: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. Alvan could also be called Alian. Shepho's alternative name is Shephi. 24. These are the offspring of Zibeon: Ajah and Anah. Anah was the one who came across some cool mules while taking care of his dad Zibeon's donkeys in the wilderness. 25. The homies from Anah had these kids; Dishon and Aholibamah, who was Anah's daughter. 26. Here are the names of Dishon's children: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. Hemdan could also be called Amram. 27. Here are the kids of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan (also known as Jakan).\" } 28. These are the descendants of Dishan: Uz and Aran. 29. These were the major influencers of the Horite community - there was Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, and Anah. 30. Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, and duke Dishan were the big shots from the crew called Hori, among the other influential peeps in the land of Seir. 31. So, there were these kings who ruled over the land of Edom. Way before any king ruled over the children of Israel, ya feel me? 32. So like, this dude named Bela, Beor's son, was like the boss in Edom, you know? And his city, it was called Dinhabah and stuff. 33. Bela passed away, and then Jobab, Zerah's son from Bozrah, took over as the ruler. 34. And Jobab passed away, and Husham from the land of Temani took over as ruler in his place. 35. So, Husham passed away and then Hadad, the son of Bedad, became the ruler. Hadad led the victorious attack against the Midianites in the Moab region. His city was called Avith. 36. And Hadad passed away, and Samlah of Masrekah took over as ruler. 37. Then Samlah passed away, and Saul from Rehoboth took over as ruler near the river. 38. And like, Saul passed away, you know, and then Baalhanan, Achbor's son, took over as king, totally stepping into his shoes. 39. So yeah, Baalhanan, Achbor's son, passed away and Hadar took over as ruler. Hadar's city was called Pau, and his wife's name was Mehetabel, who was the daughter of Matred and the granddaughter of Mezahab. Just a heads up, after Hadar, things went down a whole different political path. 40. And these are the cool kids who were part of Esau's crew, representing their families, their territories, and their names. We got Timnah, the ultimate duke, Alvah, the boss duke, and Jetheth, the duke with serious style. (Alvah is also known as Aliah, just so you know.) 41. Dope Aholibamah, Elah the homie, Pinon the legend, 42. Duke Kenaz, Duke Teman, Duke Mibzar, 43. Duke Magdiel and duke Iram were the top guys of Edom, living in their own spots within the land they owned. Esau, the dad of the Edomites, was in charge. (The Edomites were from Edom, just so you know.)\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 361. Now these {are} the generations of Esau, who {is} Edom. 2.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 371. So Jacob lived in the land where his dad was just visiting, in Canaan. 2. So, here's the deal, this is the story of Jacob's fam. Joseph, who was just a kid of seventeen, was hangin' out with his bros and taking care of the flock. He was chillin' with the sons of his dad's wives, Bilhah and Zilpah. And one day, Joseph goes and tells his pops about the shady stuff they were up to. 3. Israel was totally vibing with Joseph and showed him mad love, since he was his favorite child and was born when Israel was getting up there in age. He even hooked Joseph up with this sick coat, decked out in all sorts of rad colors. 4. And when his siblings noticed that their dad liked him way more than them, they straight up hated him and couldn't even have a chill convo with him. 5. So Joseph had this dream, and he decided to share it with his bros. But instead of being stoked about it, they got even more salty and started hating on him even harder. 6. Yo, listen up, fam! Check out this dream I had, alright? 7. So listen up, I was out in the field, bundling up the wheat. And get this, my bundle of wheat stood up tall and proud. And guess what? Your bundles of wheat gathered around and bowed down to mine! 8. And his siblings were like, seriously, are you gonna be our ruler? Like, are you gonna boss us around? And they hated him even more because he would always talk about his dreams and what they meant. 9. So, like, Joseph had another dream and he was all like, 'Hey fam, listen up! I had this crazy dream where the sun, moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.'\" } 10. So he goes and tells his dad and siblings about it, and his dad isn't too thrilled. He's like, 'What's up with this dream you had? You really think me, your mom, and your siblings are gonna bow down to you? Like, seriously?' 11. And his siblings were totally jealous of him, but his dad totally took note of what was going on. 12. So his squad went to take care of their dad's animals in Shechem. 13. Israel was like, 'Yo Joseph, aren't your brothers supposed to be chillin' with the flock in Shechem? Go find them, I'll send you over.' Joseph was all like, 'For sure, here I am.'\" } 14. Yo, listen up! He told him, 'Hey, can you do me a solid and check in on your brothers and see how they're doing, along with the flock? Let me know how everything's going.' So he sent him away from Hebron and he made his way to Shechem. You feel me? 15. So this guy came across him, and it turns out he was just wandering around in the field. The guy approached him and was like, 'Hey, what are you looking for?' 16. And he was like, yo, where my bros at? Can you please let me know where they hang and chill with their flocks? 17. The guy was like, 'Yo, those dudes bounced! I overheard them saying, 'Let's hit up Dothan.'\" So Joseph was like, 'Bet,' and went to find his brothers, and ended up locating them in Dothan. 18. So, like, when they spotted him from a distance, way before he even got close to them, they got all schemey and planned to straight up kill the dude. 19. And they were like, listen, here comes the guy who thinks he's the ultimate expert in dreams. {dreamer: Hebrew meaning 'master of dreams'} 20. Yo, let's do something about this, like totally take him out and throw him into a pit. Then we'll be like, 'Oh no, some savage creature just chowed down on him!' It'll be so interesting to see what happens to his dreams after that. 21. Reuben heard what was up, so he saved him from their clutches and was like, 'Nah, let's not take this to the extreme and end his life.' 22. And Reuben was like, 'Yo, don't straight up kill him or anything, just chuck him into this random pit in the middle of nowhere, and don't you dare touch him! The plan is to save him from their hands and eventually reunite him with his dad.'\" } 23. So, like, Joseph went to hang with his bros and they straight up took off his cool rainbow coat he was wearing, you know, the one with all the colors. It was a pretty swag outfit, no cap. 24. So they grabbed him and tossed him into a pit, and guess what? The pit was totally dry, not a drop of water in sight. 25. So, they were just chilling, about to feast on some bread, when they suddenly spotted a gang of Ishmeelites coming from Gilead. These peeps were rollin' with their camels loaded up with spices, balm, and myrrh, all set to take it down to Egypt. 26. Judah was like, yo bros, what's the point if we kill our own brother and then hide the evidence? 27. Hey, let's sell him to the Ishmeelites instead of hurting him ourselves, because he's our own flesh and blood. His brothers agreed with the plan. 28. So, like, these Midianite merchant guys were passing by, right? And they saw Joseph stuck in this pit and were all like, 'Nah, we'll help the dude out.' But instead of setting him free, they sold him to the Ishmaelites for, like, twenty pieces of silver. And off they went, taking Joseph all the way to Egypt. 29. So Reuben went back to the pit where they had left Joseph, but guess what? Joseph wasn't there anymore! Reuben became totally distraught and tore his clothes in despair. 30. So he went back to his buddies and was like, 'Guys, the kid's gone! And now, where do I even go?' 31. So, like, they grabbed Joseph's sick coat, and then they straight up took a baby goat, killed it, and dunked the coat in its blood, man. 32. So they sent that sick jacket their brother wore and delivered it to their dad, saying, 'Yo, check it out. We found this. Can you confirm if it's your son's swag or what?' 33. He found out what happened and said, 'This is my son's jacket; a wild animal definitely attacked him and Joseph is undoubtedly torn apart!' 34. So Jacob, like, tore his clothes and put on some sackcloth and was totally mourning for his son for a long time. 35. And all his homies and all his besties came to support him; but he didn't want to feel better; and he was like, 'Nah, I'm gonna stay sad 'til I join my son in the afterlife.' So his dad cried a lot for him. 36. So, like, the Midianites totally sold him off to Egypt, to this dude named Potiphar, who was like a super important officer in Pharaoh's squad. And, yo, he was the head honcho of the whole guard crew. By the way, this word 'officer' can mean eunuch, but it also includes chamberlains, courtiers, and other high-ranking peeps. And 'captain of the guard' can also be translated as the chief marshal, chief of the slaughter men, or executioners. Pretty intense, right?\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 371. And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan. {wherein...: Heb. of his father's sojournings} 2. These {are} the generations of Jacob. Joseph, {being} seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad {was} with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report. 3. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he {was} the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of {many} colours. {colours: or, pieces} 4. And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him. 5. And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told {it} his brethren: and they hated him yet the more. 6. And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: 7. For, behold, we {were} binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf. 8. And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words. 9. And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me. 10. And he told {it} to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What {is} this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? 11. And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying. 12. And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem. 13. And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed {the flock} in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here {am I}. 14. And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. {see...: Heb. see the peace of thy brethren, etc.} 15. And a certain man found him, and, behold, {he was} wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? 16. And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed {their flocks}. 17. And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. 18. And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him. 19. And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh. {dreamer: Heb. master of dreams} 20. Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams. 21. And Reuben heard {it}, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him. 22. And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, {but} cast him into this pit that {is} in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again. 23. And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, {his} coat of {many} colours that {was} on him; {colours: or, pieces} 24. And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit {was} empty, {there was} no water in it. 25. And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry {it} down to Egypt. 26. And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit {is it} if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood? 27. Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he {is} our brother {and} our flesh. And his brethren were content. {were...: Heb. hearkened} 28. Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty {pieces} of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt. 29. And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph {was} not in the pit; and he rent his clothes. 30. And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child {is} not; and I, whither shall I go? 31. And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood; 32. And they sent the coat of {many} colours, and they brought {it} to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it {be} thy son's coat or no. 33. And he knew it, and said, {It is} my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces. 34. And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days. 35. And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him. 36. And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, {and} captain of the guard. {officer: Heb. eunuch: but the word doth signify not only eunuchs, but also chamberlains, courtiers, and officers} {captain...: or, chief marshal: Heb. chief of the slaughter men, or executioners} \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 381. So, there was this moment when Judah decided to separate himself from his brothers and headed over to this Adullamite dude named Hirah. 2. So, Judah noticed this Canaanite girl named Shuah and decided to get close to her and be intimate with her. 3. And she got pregnant and gave birth to a son; and he named him Er. 4. And then she got pregnant again and gave birth to a son, and she named him Onan. 5. And then she got pregnant again, and gave birth to a son. She named him Shelah. He was born in Chezib. 6. And Judah found a partner for his oldest son, Er, and her name was Tamar. 7. Er, who was the oldest son of Judah, did things that were seen as wrong by the LORD, so the LORD caused him to die. 8. And Judah told Onan, 'Yo bro, go sleep with your brother's wife and be her husband, so that you can have kids in his name.'\" } 9. And Onan realized that the offspring wouldn't be considered his own. So, when he slept with his brother's wife, he intentionally wasted it on the ground to prevent her from getting pregnant and continuing his brother's family line. 10. And what he did was not cool with the LORD, so he ended up taking him out too. {not cool...: In the Hebrew text, it says it was bad in the eyes of the Lord} 11. So Judah told his daughter-in-law Tamar, 'Stay at your father's place as a widow until my son Shelah grows up, because I'm afraid he might end up like his brothers who died.' So Tamar went and lived at her father's house. 12. After some time, Shuah's daughter, who was married to Judah, sadly passed away. Judah mourned her loss but eventually found solace and decided to go up to Timnath with his buddy Hirah the Adullamite to watch over his sheep and get some work done. (By the way, 'in process of time' just means a while had passed.) 13. Tamar heard the news that her father-in-law was heading to Timnath to shear his sheep. 14. And she changed out of her widow's clothes and put on a veil, wrapping herself up. Then she sat in a public place along the road to Timnath. She did this because she noticed that Shelah had grown up, but she wasn't being given to him as his wife. (This public place was known as the Door of Eyes or Enajim.) 15. When Judah saw her, he assumed she was a sex worker because she had her face covered. 16. And he saw her on the way and said, like, hey, can I come over to your place? (he didn't know she was his daughter-in-law). And she was like, what's in it for me if you come in? 17. And he was like, yo, I'll hook you up with a cute lil baby goat from my flock. And she was like, hold up, can you gimme something as a guarantee until you actually send it? You know, like a deposit or something? (btw, when it says 'kid', it means a baby goat, just a lil FYI) 18. And he was like, 'What can I give you as a sign of trust?' And she was all, 'Give me your cool ring, your stylish bracelets, and that rad staff you're holding.' So yeah, he handed them over, hooked up with her, and boom! She got pregnant. 19. Then she got up, left, took off her head covering, and put on the clothes for mourning. 20. So Judah sent his buddy from Adullam to pick up the stuff he left with that woman, but he couldn't find her. 21. So he asked the guys there, like, 'Where's that girl who was, like, standing out in the open on the side of the road?' And they were all 'Oh, there wasn't any girl like that in this place, at all.'\" } 22. So he went back to Judah and was like, 'Yo, I couldn't find her.' And the dudes from that spot were like, 'Nah, bro, there ain't no sex workers here.'\" } 23. Judah was like, 'Yeah, just let her have it so we don't look bad. I mean, I did try to give her this animal, but you couldn't find her. We don't want to be humiliated, right?' 24. So, like, after about three months, someone came and told Judah, like, 'Yo, Tamar your daughter-in-law has been, like, doing some shady stuff, you know? She's pregnant and it's, like, not a good situation.' And Judah was all, 'Bring her out, man, we gotta, like, punish her, maybe burn her.' 25. So, like, when she had this baby and all, she messaged her father-in-law and was all, 'Guess what, guess who made me preggo?' And she was like, 'Can you, like, figure out whose stuff these are? The fancy ring, the bracelets, and the cool staff.'\" } 26. And Judah was like, yo, I gotta admit, she's way more righteous than me. 'Cause, like, I didn't give her to my son Shelah. And, btw, he never hooked up with her again. 27. So, like, when it was time for her to give birth and all, surprise! There were, like, twins in her belly. 28. So, when she was in labor, the baby reached out its hand, and the midwife quickly tied a red thread around its hand, saying, 'This baby is the first one to come out.' 29. And then, like, as he pulled back his hand, his brother like, totally came out, and she was all like, 'Whoa, dude, how did you break out like that?' So they named him Pharez, which, like, means 'a breach' because, you know, he caused quite the commotion by breaking out like that. 30. And then his brother came out, and he had a dope scarlet thread on his hand. They called him Zarah.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 381. And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name {was} Hirah. 2. And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name {was} Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her. 3. And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er. 4. And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan. 5. And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him. 6. And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name {was} Tamar. 7. And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him. 8. And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother. 9. And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled {it} on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother. 10. And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also. {displeased...: Heb. was evil in the eyes of the Lord} 11. Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren {did}. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house. 12. And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. {in process...: Heb. the days were multiplied} 13. And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep. 14. And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place, which {is} by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife. {an open...: Heb. the door of eyes, or, of Enajim} 15. When Judah saw her, he thought her {to be} an harlot; because she had covered her face. 16. And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she {was} his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me? 17. And he said, I will send {thee} a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give {me} a pledge, till thou send {it}? {a kid: Heb. a kid of the goats} 18. And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that {is} in thine hand. And he gave {it} her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him. 19. And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood. 20. And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive {his} pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not. 21. Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where {is} the harlot, that {was} openly by the way side? And they said, There was no harlot in this {place}. {openly: or, in Enajim} 22. And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, {that} there was no harlot in this {place}. 23. And Judah said, Let her take {it} to her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her. {be shamed: Heb. become a contempt} 24. And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she {is} with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. 25. When she {was} brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these {are, am} I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose {are} these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff. 26. And Judah acknowledged {them}, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more. 27. And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins {were} in her womb. 28. And it came to pass, when she travailed, that {the one} put out {his} hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first. 29. And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? {this} breach {be} upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez. {How hast...: or, Wherefore hast thou made this breach against thee?} {Pharez: that is A breach} 30. And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 391. So, like, Joseph was taken to Egypt, ya know? And, get this, Potiphar, this big shot working for Pharaoh, who's like the boss, dude, and is in charge of the guards, he's an Egyptian, by the way, bought him from those Ishmeelites who brought Joseph down there. Crazy, right? 2. God was vibing with Joseph, and he was straight-up successful. He was living it up in his master's crib, which happened to be in Egypt. 3. And his boss noticed that God was on his side, and that God made everything he did successful. 4. And Joseph was totally blessed in his boss's eyes, so he worked for him and his boss promoted him as the head honcho of his crib. He trusted Joseph with everything he owned. 5. So, like, when Joseph was put in charge of everything in Potiphar's house, the whole place started thriving, thanks to God's blessing.

So, like, this guy totally trusted Joseph with everything he had, and he didn't even have to worry about anything, except for the food he ate. Joseph was, you know, really good-looking and attractive. 7. After all this happened, his boss's wife started checking out Joseph and straight up said, 'Wanna hook up?' 8. But he was like, no way, and he said to his master's wife, look, my master has no idea what's going on with me in the house, and he's entrusted me with everything he's got; 9. Yo, I'm the top dog in this crib, and my boss has trusted me with everything except you, because you're his wifey. So why would I even consider doing this messed up stuff and going against God? 10. One day, she kept on talking to Joseph, but he didn't give in to her or hang out with her. 11. So, like, at around that time, Joseph went into the house to handle his stuff, and, like, none of the guys who lived there were around. 12. Then she grabbed his clothes and said, 'Hook up with me!' But he made a quick exit, leaving his clothes behind. 13. So, like, she noticed that he, like, left his clothes with her and, you know, totally ran away, 14. So, she gathered her squad and had a real talk with them, like, yo, check it - this guy brought in a Hebrew dude to clown us. He tried to get all up in my business, but I straight up screamed at the top of my lungs, you feel me? {loud: aka great} 15. And then, when he heard me raising my voice and crying out, he quickly ditched his clothes with me and made a swift exit. 16. And she kept his outfit with her until her boss came home. 17. So she told him, 'Hey, listen up. The Hebrew servant you brought here? Well, he came into my space and started making fun of me.' 18. So, like, I was just expressing myself and calling out, and then he like totally bailed and left his clothes behind. 19. So, when his boss heard what his wife said, telling him that his servant did this to her, he got really mad. 20. So, Joseph's boss took him and threw him into prison, the spot where all the king's prisoners were held. And yup, he stayed there in the prison. 21. Yo, God had Joseph's back, and like, totally showed him love and kindness, and the prison guard was totally into him. It was lit, man. 22.

      "KJV: Genesis 391. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down thither. 2. And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian. 3. And his master saw that the LORD {was} with him, and that the LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand. 4. And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all {that} he had he put into his hand. 5. And it came to pass from the time {that} he had made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house, and in the field. 6. And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was {a} goodly {person}, and well favoured. 7.

The butler and baker, they were chilling in the Egyptian king's prison and all. 6. So Joseph walked up to them in the morning and saw that they were feeling down. 7. And he asked Pharaoh's squad that were chillin' with him in the crib of his boss's house, like, yo, why y'all lookin' all bummed out today? Why your faces lookin' mad negative? 8. So they were like, 'Yo, we had this wild dream but there's nobody who can explain it to us.' And Joseph was like, 'Bro, don't interpretations come from God? Tell me what went down, if you could, please.'\" } 9. So, like, the head butler spills his dreams to Joseph and he's all like, 'Dude, I had this dream where there was a huge vine right in front of me.'\" } 10. So, like, there were these three branches in the vine, and they were all budding and blooming and stuff, and then these bunches of grapes popped up and they were totally ripe and ready to, like, eat and enjoy. 11. So, like, I had Pharaoh's cup in my hand, right? And I grabbed these grapes and squeezed them into the cup. Then, I handed the cup back to Pharaoh, just like that. 12. Joseph was like, 'Listen up, fam. Here's what that dream means: those three branches represent three days. 13. In just three days, Pharaoh is gonna recognize your skills and put you back in your position. You'll even be trusted with handing Pharaoh his cup, just like you used to do when you were his butler. {reckon: or, consider} 14. But, like, when things are going great for you, do me a solid and remember me, show me some kindness, and, you know, put in a good word for me with Pharaoh. I'm just tryna get outta this place, ya feel me? 15. So like, I was totally taken from the Hebrew land, and honestly, I didn't even do anything to deserve getting thrown into the dungeon here. 16. So, like, the head baker saw that Joseph's interpretation was legit and he was like, 'Yo, Joseph, I had this dream too, man. And get this, bro, I saw three totally rad white baskets on my head – and by white I mean, like, full of holes, you know?' 17. So, like, the top basket had all kinds of yummy food for Pharaoh, and, you won't believe it, but the birds actually ate it right off my head. It was like their feast, you know? 18. And Joseph was like, 'Yo, I got you with the 411 on this dream interpretation. So, check it: those three baskets represent three days, my dude.' 19. In like, three days, Pharaoh is gonna be like, 'You're out, man!' and like, hang you on a tree for everyone to see. And then, birds are gonna come and feast on your flesh. Just saying. 20. So, like, on the third day, it was Pharaoh's birthday and he decided to throw this massive party for all his servants. During the party, he singled out the head butler and head baker from his crew. 21. And he totally hooked up the main butler, like, he got his butlership back and even let him hold Pharaoh's cup, no cap: 22. But yo, Joseph was straight up right 'bout his interpretation and this resulted in the chief baker gettin' executed by hanging. 23. But, like, the head butler totally forgot about Joseph and, like, didn't remember him at all.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 401. And it came to pass after these things, {that} the butler of the king of Egypt and {his} baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt. 2. And Pharaoh was wroth against two {of} his officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers. 3. And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph {was} bound. 4. And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them: and they continued a season in ward. 5. And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which {were} bound in the prison. 6. And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon them, and, behold, they {were} sad. 7. And he asked Pharaoh's officers that {were} with him in the ward of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye {so} sadly to day? {look...: Heb. are your faces evil?} 8. And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and {there is} no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, {Do} not interpretations {belong} to God? tell me {them}, I pray you. 9. And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine {was} before me; 10. And in the vine {were} three branches: and it {was} as though it budded, {and} her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 11. And Pharaoh's cup {was} in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand. 12. And Joseph said unto him, This {is} the interpretation of it: The three branches {are} three days: 13. Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. {lift...: or, reckon} 14. But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: {think...: Heb. remember me with thee} 15. For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. 16. When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also {was} in my dream, and, behold, {I had} three white baskets on my head: {white: or, full of holes} 17. And in the uppermost basket {there was} of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. {bakemeats...: Heb. meat of Pharaoh, the work of a baker, or, cook} 18. And Joseph answered and said, This {is} the interpretation thereof: The three baskets {are} three days: 19. Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. {lift...: or, reckon thee, and take thy office from thee} 20. And it came to pass the third day, {which was} Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. {lifted...: or, reckoned} 21. And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand: 22. But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. 23. Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 411. So, after two whole years had passed, Pharaoh had a dream. And guess what? He was standing by the river. 2. So, like, these super good-looking and chubby cows came out of the river and started grazing in a meadow. 3. So, like, there were seven more cows that came out of the river, but these ones looked sick and skinny. And they, like, stood next to the other cows by the edge of the river. 4. And the not-so-pretty and skinny cows totally devoured the seven good-looking and chubby cows. So Pharaoh woke up from his dream. 5. So, he dozed off again and had another dream: and, yo, check it - seven ears of corn popped up on one stalk, looking hella plump and dope. {rank: Hebrew for fat} 6. Yo, check it out, seven weak ears dried up from the east wind grew right after them. 7. So, like, the seven scrawny ears totally chowed down on the seven plump and good-looking ears. And then Pharaoh woke up, and woah, he realized it was all just a dream. 8. So the next morning, he was feeling really anxious, and decided to gather all the magicians and wise people of Egypt. Pharaoh told them about his dream, but sadly, none of them could figure out what it meant for Pharaoh. 9. So the head butler talked to Pharaoh and was like, 'Yo, I just realized I messed up, my bad.'\" } 10. Pharaoh got seriously mad at his dudes and locked me up in the captain of the guard's crib, me and the top baker dude: 11. So like, dude, we were just chilling one night and both of us had these crazy dreams. And get this, each dream had its own unique meaning! 12. So, there was this dope young dude with us, a Hebrew homie who worked as a servant for the captain of the guard. We spilled our dreams to him, and he straight up decoded them for each of us based on what we dreamt about. 13. So, like, what happened was, the guy totally explained exactly what it meant, and it turned out to be true, dude. He brought me back to my important job, and, you know, unfortunately, he ended up giving the other guy the boot. 14. So Pharaoh hit up Joseph and they pulled him out of jail real quick. He freshened up, got a fresh cut, switched up his outfit, and went to meet Pharaoh. 15. So Pharaoh was like, 'Yo Joseph, I had this crazy dream but nobody can make sense of it. But I heard you have mad skills in interpreting dreams. Like, you got that gift, ya know? So if you hear a dream, you can totally break it down.' 16. Joseph replied to Pharaoh, like, it's not really up to me, you know? God's got this and He'll totally give you a chill and peaceful answer, man. 17. So Pharaoh was like, 'Yo Joseph, check it, I had this dream where I was chillin' by the river bank:' 18. Yo, check it out, there were these seven cows that came out of the river, and dang, they were thicc and lookin' fly. They went to eat in a lush field. 19. And, like, woah, seven more cows showed up, man, and they were like, totally skinny and ugly and sickly-looking, like I've never seen anything so messed up in Egypt, dude. 20. So, like, the skinny and ugly cows totally chowed down on the first seven plump cows: 21. And after they devoured, it was like, impossible to tell that they had actually eaten them; but they still looked totally uncool, just like before. Then I woke up, man. 22. So, in my dream, I saw something pretty crazy – like, imagine this: there was this stalk, right? And hanging from it were these seven ears that were, like, perfect and totally awesome! 23. Yo, peep this: seven ears popped up, but they were all withered, thin, and straight up wrecked by the east wind. Like, they were smaller and shriveled, you know? 24. Then the skinny ears ate the seven good ears, and I explained this to the magicians, but no one could tell me what it meant. 25. So Joseph told Pharaoh, both of Pharaoh's dreams mean the same thing: God revealed to Pharaoh what's gonna happen soon. 26. So like, the seven healthy cows represent seven years, and the seven good ears of corn also represent seven years. It's like, the dream is all about the same thing, you know? 27. So, like, those seven skinny and unattractive cows that appeared after the other ones, they represent seven years, you know? And those seven dried-up ears of corn messed up by the east wind, they're like a sign of seven years of major famine. 28. So, this is what I've told Pharaoh: God is gonna make it crystal clear to him about what He's gonna do. 29. Yo, check it out! So, like, for the next seven years, Egypt's gonna totally be lit with plenty of everything all over the place, ya know? 30. And then, like, after that, there's gonna be seven years of straight-up famine, fam. Like, everyone's gonna forget about all the abundance and goodness in Egypt, 'cause this famine is gonna straight-up devour the whole land. 31. And there won't be any abundance in the land because of that intense famine; it's gonna be truly tough. Like, super heavy and serious. 32. And the reason the dream came to Pharaoh twice is because God is totally behind it and He's gonna make it happen real soon. God's got it all planned out! 33. So like, Pharaoh needs to find someone who's really smart and clever, and put them in charge of Egypt, you know? 34. Yo, Pharaoh should totally get on this move and like, hire some managers to take charge of the land. And during the seven years of plenty, he should like, claim a fifth of Egypt's land for real. 35. Yo, make sure to stock up on all the grub during the years when everything is going great. Store up that corn for Pharaoh and stash away food in the cities. 36. And that food will be saved for the land during the seven years of famine that will happen in Egypt, so that the land doesn't get messed up by the famine. (Mess up...: Hebrew, not get cut off) 37. Pharaoh and all his homies were totally vibin' with it. 38. And Pharaoh was like, guys, you gotta admit, this dude is something special. I mean, where else can we find someone with such incredible skills and, like, a true connection to the divine? 39. Pharaoh was like, 'Yo Joseph, God has totally given you all this insight and you are straight up the most clever and wise person we've got around here:' 40. You're gonna be the boss of my crib, and all my peeps will do as you say, no doubt. Only when it comes to the throne, I'll have a higher rank than you. {be ruled: which means have authority, or show respect}\" } 41. So Pharaoh's like, yo Joseph, check it, I've made you the big boss of all Egypt. 42. So Pharaoh, like, removed his own ring from his hand and totally placed it on Joseph's hand, and dressed him up in really sleek and stylish clothes made of fine linen. He even put a cool gold chain around Joseph's neck; it was like, super fancy, you know? (Fine linen can also mean silk, just FYI). 43. Then he let him ride in the swaggy second chariot he had, and everyone was like, 'Yo, show respect and bow down!' And he made him the ultimate boss of all Egypt. 'Respect, Father' was his new name, ya feel? 44. Pharaoh was like, hey Joseph, just so you know, I'm Pharaoh, and nobody in Egypt can do anything without you. Like, no one can even lift a finger or take a step without your say-so. 45. Pharaoh was like, 'Yo, Joseph, your new name is Zaphnathpaaneah,' and he hooked him up with Asenath, who was the daughter of Potipherah, the priest of On. Then Joseph became the real deal and had authority all over Egypt. Fun fact: Zaphnathpaaneah means 'A revealer of secrets' or 'The man to whom secrets are revealed' in Coptic. 46. So, Joseph was like, thirty years old when he straight-up stood in front of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And then Joseph left Pharaoh's presence and went all over Egypt, checking things out. 47. During the seven years of plenty, the earth was totally slaying the game with its abundance of crops. 48. And he like, collected all the grub, like the total eats of the seven years, that were in Egypt, and stashed it in the cities. He made sure to store the crops from all the fields surrounding each city in the same way. 49. Joseph snagged an insane amount of corn, like more than you could ever fathom, until he straight up lost count; like seriously, it was endless! 50. Before the famine went down, Joseph had two sons. Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah who was a priest in the city of On, gave birth to them. 51. And Joseph gave his firstborn son the name Manasseh, because he believed that God has helped him move past all the struggles and troubles he faced, as well as the burden of his family's past. Manasseh means 'Forgetting'. 52. And the second one, he named Ephraim. Why? Because God blessed me with prosperity even during the hard times in this place that has brought me suffering. Ephraimm means 'Fruitful', if you were wondering.) 53. And the amazing abundance that happened in Egypt for seven years finally came to an end. 54. And yeah, the seven years of like, severe shortage began to happen, just like Joseph predicted. And this shortage was happening everywhere, like all over the world. But in Egypt specifically, they had bread and were not affected. 55. So, like, when Egypt was totally out of food, everyone was freaking out and begging Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh was all like, 'Yo, just go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you to do, alright?' 56. So, like there was a really big famine going on everywhere, even in Egypt. And guess what? Joseph was like, 'Yo, let's open up all the storehouses and start selling food to the Egyptians.' But dang, the famine got even worse in Egypt. 57. So, like, all these countries were totally coming to Egypt, you know, to get some of that grain from Joseph. The famine was hitting hard, man, like, every single land was experiencing it.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 411. And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 2. And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 3. And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the {other} kine upon the brink of the river. 4. And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 5. And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. {rank: Heb. fat} 6. And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 7. And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, {it was} a dream. 8. And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but {there was} none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh. 9. Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 10. Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, {both} me and the chief baker: 11. And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 12. And {there was} there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. 13. And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged. 14. Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved {himself}, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. {brought...: Heb. made him run} 15. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and {there is} none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, {that} thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. {thou...: or, when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it} 16. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, {It is} not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 17. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 18. And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 19. And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness: 20. And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 21. And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they {were} still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. {eaten...: Heb. come to the inward parts of them} 22. And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: 23. And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, {and} blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: {withered: or, small} 24. And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told {this} unto the magicians; but {there was} none that could declare {it} to me. 25. And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh {is} one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he {is} about to do. 26. The seven good kine {are} seven years; and the seven good ears {are} seven years: the dream {is} one. 27. And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them {are} seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. 28. This {is} the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God {is} about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 29. Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt: 30. And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 31. And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it {shall be} very grievous. {grievous: Heb. heavy} 32. And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; {it is} because the thing {is} established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass. {established...: or, prepared of God} 33. Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 34. Let Pharaoh do {this}, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years. {officers: or, overseers} 35. And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 36. And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine. {perish...: Heb. be not cut off} 37. And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 38. And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find {such a one} as this {is}, a man in whom the Spirit of God {is}? 39. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, {there is} none so discreet and wise as thou {art}: 40. Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. {be ruled: Heb. be armed, or, kiss} 41. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. 42. And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; {fine...: or, silk} 43. And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him {ruler} over all the land of Egypt. {Bow...: or, Tender father: Heb. Abrech} 44. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I {am} Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt. 45. And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over {all} the land of Egypt. {Zaphnathpaaneah: which in the Coptic signifies, A revealer of secrets, or, The man to whom secrets are revealed} {priest: or, prince} 46. And Joseph {was} thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt. 47. And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 48. And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which {was} round about every city, laid he up in the same. 49. And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for {it was} without number. 50. And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. {priest: or, prince} 51. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, {said he}, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. {Manasseh: that is, Forgetting} 52. And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction. {Ephraim: that is, Fruitful} 53. And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. 54. And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread. 55. And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 56. And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt. {all the storehouses: Heb. all wherein was} 57. And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy {corn}; because that the famine was {so} sore in all lands. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 421. So like, when Jacob peeped that there was mad corn in Egypt, he was all like, 'Yo sons, why you just standing there starin' at each other?' 2. And he was like, yo, I've heard there's mad corn in Egypt. So, you should totally head down there and buy some for us, you know? That way, we won't starve and die. 3. So, like, Joseph's ten brothers headed down to Egypt to cop some corn. 4. But Jacob didn't let Benjamin, Joseph's brother, go with his other brothers because he was worried that something bad might happen to him. 5. So, like, the Israelites went to get some grain from the peeps who already had some, ‘cause there was, like, a major famine going on in Canaan. 6. So, like, Joseph was totally in charge of the whole land, and he was the one selling stuff to everyone. And then his brothers showed up and like, totally bowed down to him, putting their faces on the ground and all. 7. So Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted like he didn't know them and spoke sternly to them. He asked them, 'Where did you come from?' And they replied, 'We came from Canaan to buy food.' 8. And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn't recognize him. 9. So, Joseph totally remembered those dreams he had about them and straight up said, you guys are like spies or something, checking out the land in secret! 10. They were like, 'Nah, bro. We're here just to get some grub, not cause trouble, my dude.'\" } 11. We're all just some dudes, bro. Like, seriously, we ain't lying or anything, we're your faithful homies, not undercover agents or anything. 12. And he was like, no way, bro, you guys came just to scope out the land's beautiful view. 13. So, like, there's twelve of us, bros, and we're all sons of this one dude from Canaan. And, check it, the youngest dude is hanging out with our pops today, but one of us ain't here, man. 14. Joseph was like, yo listen up, remember when I told you that you guys were spies? Well, that's what I was talking about. 15. Alright, here's the deal: You ain't leaving here unless your little bro rolls through, I swear on Pharaoh's life. 16. Yo, send one of y'all to go get your brother. Meanwhile, the rest of y'all gonna be locked up so we can see if you're tellin' the truth or if y'all some spies. Swear on Pharaoh's life! 17. And he gathered all of them and kept them confined for three days. 18. And Joseph was like, yo listen up on the third day. If you wanna keep living, you gotta do this thing, coz I respect and fear God, you know? 19. If you guys are really real ones, then have one of your squad be locked up in your crib while the rest of y'all go and grab some food for the famines in your houses: 20. But like, bring your youngest bro to me, and then you'll totally prove what you're saying, and you won't get in trouble. And they actually did it, no joke. 21. So, like, they were talking to each other and being super honest, saying that they totally messed up when it came to their brother. They saw how much pain he was going through, pleading with them, but they totally ignored him. And now, they're facing all this trouble because of it. 22. And Reuben was like, 'Didn't I tell you not to do anything bad to the kid? But you didn't listen! Now, his blood is on your hands.'\" } 23. And they didn't realize that Joseph could understand them, because he was speaking to them through an interpreter. (The interpreter was the one translating their words for Joseph.) 24. Then he turned away from them and couldn't help but cry. After a moment, he went back to them and started talking with them. He decided to take Simeon from among them and tied him up right before their eyes. 25. So Joseph was like, 'Yo, fill up their bags with corn and put their money back in their bags, and give them some food for their journey.' And that's exactly what he did to them. 26. And they loaded their donkeys with the corn, and left from there. 27. And when one of them opened his backpack to give his donkey some food at the hotel, he noticed his money; because, you know, it was right there in his backpack. 28. And he was like, guys, my money is back in my bag! They were shook and scared, asking each other, yo, what did God just do to us? 29. So they went to their dad Jacob in Canaan and told him everything that happened to them. They were like, 30. Yo, this dude, who's like the boss of the whole land, straight up came at us with some harsh words and accused us of being spies from another country. Like, he didn't hold back at all... 31. And we were like, 'Yo, bro, we ain't no spies or anything, but we're just straight-up honest dudes, you feel me?' 32. So there's like twelve of us, bros, all from the same pops. But one of us isn't here and the youngest one, he's chilling with our pops back home in Canaan. 33. And the guy in charge told us, 'Look, this is how I'm gonna know if you guys are legit. Leave one of your bros here with me and take some food for your fam back home, then you can bounce and deal with the famine.' 34. And like, bring your little brother to me, then I'll know you're not like undercover agents or whatever, but legit dudes. And then I'll totally give your brother back to you, and you can do your thing in this land. 35. And when they emptied their bags, they found that every guy's cash stash was still in their bag. When they and their dad saw the money, they got freaked out. 36. Then their dad, Jacob, said to them, 'You've taken away my children! Joseph is gone, Simeon is gone, and now you want to take Benjamin away too? It feels like everything is going against me.'\" } 37. Reuben went to his old man and said, 'Yo, Dad, if I don't bring him back to you, go ahead and end my two bros. Trust me, hand him over to me, and I'll make sure he returns to you.'\"}\n",

      " 38. And he was like, 'Nah, my son can't roll with you guys. His brother died, so he's all alone now. If anything bad happens to him while you're out there, it's gonna crush me and bring me to utter despair.'\" } \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 421. Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another? 2. And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die. 3. And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt. 4. But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him. 5. And the sons of Israel came to buy {corn} among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 6. And Joseph {was} the governor over the land, {and} he {it was} that sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves before him {with} their faces to the earth. 7. And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. {roughly...: Heb. hard things with them} 8. And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. 9. And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye {are} spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 10. And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 11. We {are} all one man's sons; we {are} true {men}, thy servants are no spies. 12. And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 13. And they said, Thy servants {are} twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest {is} this day with our father, and one {is} not. 14. And Joseph said unto them, That {is it} that I spake unto you, saying, Ye {are} spies: 15. Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 16. Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether {there be any} truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye {are} spies. {kept...: Heb. bound} 17. And he put them all together into ward three days. {put: Heb. gathered} 18. And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live; {for} I fear God: 19. If ye {be} true {men}, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your houses: 20. But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. 21. And they said one to another, We {are} verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us. 22. And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore, behold, also his blood is required. 23. And they knew not that Joseph understood {them}; for he spake unto them by an interpreter. {he spake...: Heb. an interpreter was between them} 24. And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and communed with them, and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. 25. Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus did he unto them. 26. And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence. 27. And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it {was} in his sack's mouth. 28. And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, {it is} even in my sack: and their heart failed {them}, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What {is} this {that} God hath done unto us? {failed...: Heb. went forth} 29. And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that befell unto them; saying, 30. The man, {who is} the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and took us for spies of the country. {roughly...: Heb. with us hard things} 31. And we said unto him, We {are} true {men}; we are no spies: 32. We {be} twelve brethren, sons of our father; one {is} not, and the youngest {is} this day with our father in the land of Canaan. 33. And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye {are} true {men}; leave one of your brethren {here} with me, and take {food for} the famine of your households, and be gone: 34. And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye {are} no spies, but {that} ye {are} true {men: so} will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land. 35. And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money {was} in his sack: and when {both} they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 36. And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved {of my children}: Joseph {is} not, and Simeon {is} not, and ye will take Benjamin {away}: all these things are against me. 37. And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again. 38. And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 431. And there was, like, a super intense famine in the whole place. 2. So, like, when they finished eating all the corn they got from Egypt, their dad was like, 'Hey, go back and get us some more food, okay? Just a little bit.' 3. So Judah was like, dude, this guy straight up told us, 'I ain't gonna show my face unless your bro's with you.' He was serious, man. 4. Yo, if you let us bring our bro along, we're down to go and cop some food for you: 5. But, like, if you don't send {him}, we're totally not coming: 'cause the dude straight up told us we won't get to see his face unless your bro is with you, ya know? 6. Israel was like, yo, why you gotta do me dirty by telling the man about my brother? 7. So, like, this guy asked us some intense questions about our fam, you know? He was all like, 'Is your dad still around? Do you have another bro?' And we answered him exactly how he asked, ya know? But like, how could we have known that he would be all, 'Bring your bro with you'? Like, major plot twist! 8. So Judah was like, 'Hey Dad, let the boy come with us. We gotta bounce and survive, so that all of us, including you and the little ones, can stay alive.' 9. I got his back, you can count on me. If I don't bring him back to you, I'll take the blame forever. 10. If we hadn't stayed for so long, we would have definitely come back again by now. Like, this would be the second time. Or wait, actually, it's like the second time because of this. 11. Yo, listen up, my peeps! Israel, their dad, was like, 'Alright, if that's how it's gotta be, then here's the plan: Y'all grab the finest fruits we got, pack 'em up in your bags, and take 'em down to that man. Alongside, bring him a little gift, like a small jar of balm, some honey, spices, myrrh, and also some nuts and almonds.' 12. And make sure to bring twice the amount of money with you; and don't forget to take that money which was returned in the mouths of your sacks; maybe it was just a mistake: 13. Yo, grab your bro and get up. Let's go meet that dude again. 14. And may God have mercy on you in the eyes of the man, so that he will let your other brother and Benjamin go. If I lose my children, then so be it. 15. So the guys grabbed the gift and also took double the cash in their hands, along with Benjamin. They got up, headed down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 16. And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, 'Yo, bring these guys back to my crib and get them some food ready, because they're dining with me at noon. You know, like, prepare something tasty for them!' 17. So the guy did what Joseph told him to do, and he brought the dudes to Joseph's crib. 18. The guys were totally shook when they were brought into Joseph's crib. They were like, 'Yo, we got set up! Remember that cash that ended up back in our bags last time? Now he's gonna use that as an excuse to accuse us, come after us, and make us his slaves, along with our donkeys. 🙆‍♂️💸'} 19. Then they went up to the manager of Joseph's crib, and had a chat with him by the entrance to the crib. 20. And we were like, yo, we came all the way down here just to grab some grub, you know what I'm saying? We were starving and in need of some food, man. 21. So, like, when we got to the inn, we opened our luggage and, surprise, everyone's money was still in their bags, all accounted for and stuff. We brought it all back with us, no missing money or anything. 22. And like, we totally brought down some extra cash in our hands to buy some grub, but honestly, we have no clue who slipped the money into our bags, it's a total mystery! 23. And he was like, 'Yo guys, chillax! Don't be scared! Your God, and the God of your pops, just blessed you with some sick loot in your bags. By the way, I accidentally took your cash, but no biggie. Oh, and he let Simeon join y'all. Lit! (BTW, that 'your money came to me' part, yeah it means I accidentally took your moolah.) 24. So the guy took the dudes to Joseph's crib, hooked them up with some water to freshen up and washed their feet. And he also provided food for their donkeys. 25. And they prepared the gift for when Joseph arrived at noon, because they heard that they would have lunch together. 26. So, like, when Joseph got back home, they brought him this gift that they had in their hand, and then they totally bowed down before him, like, right to the ground. 27. And he was like, 'Hey, how's it going, you guys? Is your dad doing okay? You know, the old man you were talking about? Is he still alive and doing well?' 28. And they were like, 'Yo, our dad is actually doing really well, still kickin' it. So they lowered their heads and showed some respect. 29. Then he looked up and saw his bro Benjamin, his mom's kid, and asked, 'Yo, is this your lil bro you were telling me about?' And he replied, 'May God bless you, bro.' 30. And Joseph rushed, because he felt deep compassion for his brother. He looked for a place where he could cry, so he went into his room and sobbed there. 31. Then he quickly freshened up his face, headed out, controlled his emotions, and requested some food. 32. And they made separate meals for him, the Israelites, and the Egyptians who dined with him because it was considered wrong for Egyptians to eat bread with the Hebrews; it was something they found unacceptable. 33. And they all took their seats in front of him, with the oldest ones sitting first based on their birthright, and the youngest ones sitting according to their age. And everyone was amazed by each other's presence. 34. And he sent them some seriously good food from his own table: but Benjamin got five times more than anyone else. And they ate and had a lit time together.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 431. And the famine {was} sore in the land. 2. And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. 3. And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother {be} with you. {did...: Heb. protesting protested} 4. If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: 5. But if thou wilt not send {him}, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother {be} with you. 6. And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye {so} ill with me, {as} to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? 7. And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, {Is} your father yet alive? have ye {another} brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? {asked...: Heb. asking asked us} {tenor: Heb. mouth} {could...: Heb. knowing could we know} 8. And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, {and} also our little ones. 9. I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: 10. For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time. {this: or, twice by this} 11. And their father Israel said unto them, If {it must be} so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 12. And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry {it} again in your hand; peradventure it {was} an oversight: 13. Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 14. And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved {of my children}, I am bereaved. {If...: or, And I, as I have been, etc.} 15. And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. 16. And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring {these} men home, and slay, and make ready; for {these} men shall dine with me at noon. {slay: Heb. kill a killing} {dine: Heb. eat} 17. And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph's house. 18. And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. {seek...: Heb. roll himself upon us} 19. And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, 20. And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: {we...: Heb. coming down we came down} 21. And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, {every} man's money {was} in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. 22. And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. 23. And he said, Peace {be} to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. {I had...: Heb. your money came to me} 24. And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave {them} water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. 25. And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. 26. And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which {was} in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. 27. And he asked them of {their} welfare, and said, {Is} your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? {Is} he yet alive? {welfare: Heb. peace} {Is your...: Heb. Is there peace to your father?} 28. And they answered, Thy servant our father {is} in good health, he {is} yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. 29. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, {Is} this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. 30. And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought {where} to weep; and he entered into {his} chamber, and wept there. 31. And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. 32. And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that {is} an abomination unto the Egyptians. 33. And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. 34. And he took {and sent} messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him. {were...: Heb. drank largely} \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 441. Then he told his house manager, 'Yo, go fill their bags with grub, like as much as they can handle, and put each dude's dough back in their bags. Be discreet about it, tho. Ya feel me?' 2. And like, Joseph was all, 'Yo, put my fancy silver cup in the youngest bro's sack, you know. And also, throw his cash for the food in there too.' So, the dude did exactly what Joseph said, no cap. 3. When it started getting bright in the morning, they let the guys and their donkeys go. 4. So, like, after they left the city but weren't really far away, Joseph told his assistant, 'Dude, go catch up to those guys. And when you catch up to them, ask them why they're treating us with evil after we've been good to them?' 5. Umm, bro, isn't this the same cup that my lord, like, sips from and uses to, you know, get insights? By doing this, you guys have totally messed up and done something wrong, for real. (Or you could say, 'By doing this, you guys have straight up made a bad move.')\" } 6. And he caught up to them and he started talking to them, saying the exact same stuff. 7. And they were like, why is our dude saying that? No way, we can't go along with this: 8. Yo, check it! We totally brought back that cash we found in our bags, all the way from Canaan. So why would we even think of jacking your lord's silver or gold from his crib? 9. If any of your servants are found to have done this, they should face serious consequences, and we will willingly serve and obey you, my lord. 10. And he was like, okay, I'll do what you say. The person who has it will be my servant, and you all will be innocent. 11. So, like, they all quickly brought down their sacks to the ground and opened them up, you know? 12. So he looked through all of their bags, starting with the oldest and ending with the youngest. And guess what? The cup was discovered in Benjamin's bag! 13. So they're like, totally in shock, tearing their clothes and loading their ride, and all head back to the city. 14. So Judah and his squad pulled up to Joseph's crib, 'cause he was still chillin' there. And they all showed mad respect by bowing down before him like on the low. 15. And Joseph was like, yo, what's the deal with what you guys did? Don't you know that I can totally figure things out like a boss? Like, seriously, did you even think about that? 16. And Judah was like, 'Yo, what's good, my lord? What should we even say? How can we defend ourselves? God's totally exposed our wrongdoings. Check it, we're here as your servants, both us and the dude who has the cup.' 17. And he was like, nah fam, I ain't gonna do that. But the person who has the cup, they gonna be my servant. And as for y'all, you can peace out and go back to your pops without any worries. 18. So, Judah went up to him and was like, 'Hey, dude, can I like, whisper something in your ear without you getting all ticked off? 'Cause you're totally in charge, just like Pharaoh.' 19. So, the bossman asked his crew, like, yo, ya'll got a pops or a bro? 20. So, like, we told my dude, 'Yo, our dad is, like, super old and we have this little sibling who was born when our dad was, like, way past his prime, ya know? And it sucks, man, 'cause our other bro died and now he's the only one left from our mom, and our dad totally adores him. 21. And you told your crew, bring him over to me, so I can check him out with my own eyes. 22. And we were like, yo bro, the homie can't bounce without his old man. 'Cause if he leaves, his old man would straight up kick the bucket. 23. And you told your crew, unless your little bro joins the squad, you won't see me again. 24. And when we finally reached my father's place, we shared with him the message from my boss. 25. So our dad's like, yo, go get us some munchies, man. 26. And we were like, bro, we can't go down there without our youngest brother, you know? No way! We can't even see the dude's face unless our youngest brother is with us, man. 27. So, my dad, being all cool and chill, was like, 'Yo, my peeps, y'all know that my wifey gave birth to two dope sons, right?'\" } 28. Then they left my side, and I thought for sure they were completely lost. But from that moment on, I never laid eyes on them again. 29. And if you also snatch this away from me, and something bad happens to him, you'll make me really sad and sorrowful till the end of my days. 30. So, like, when I go back to my dad and the kid ain't with us, and, like, his whole life depends on the kid's life; 31. So basically, if dad sees that the boy ain't with us, he's gonna die. And us, the servants, we're gonna make dad so sad that he'll go all gray and down to the grave. 32. So, like, I promised my dad that I'd take responsibility for the kid, ya know? I told him, 'If I don't bring him back to you, then I'll forever be held accountable by you, pops.' 33. So like, listen, can you do me a solid favor? Can I be the one to take this guy's place and serve you like a loyal servant, and let this guy go hang with his bros? 34. Like, how am I supposed to face my dad if the homie ain't with me? I don't wanna witness the bad stuff that can happen to my old man.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 441. And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks {with} food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. {the steward...: Heb. him that was over his house} 2. And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. 3. As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. 4. {And} when they were gone out of the city, {and} not {yet} far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? 5. {Is} not this {it} in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. {divineth: or, maketh trial?} 6. And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. 7. And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: 8. Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? 9. With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. 10. And he said, Now also {let} it {be} according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. 11. Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. 12. And he searched, {and} began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 13. Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. 14. And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he {was} yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. 15. And Joseph said unto them, What deed {is} this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? {divine: or, make trial?} 16. And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we {are} my lord's servants, both we, and {he} also with whom the cup is found. 17. And he said, God forbid that I should do so: {but} the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. 18. Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou {art} even as Pharaoh. 19. My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 20. And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 21. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. 22. And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for {if} he should leave his father, {his father} would die. 23. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. 24. And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. 25. And our father said, Go again, {and} buy us a little food. 26. And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother {be} with us. 27. And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two {sons}: 28. And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: 29. And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. 30. Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad {be} not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life; 31. It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad {is} not {with us}, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 32. For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. 33. Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. 34.

And they, like, went near him. And he was like, 'Dudes, it's me, Joseph, your bro! Remember how you sold me out and sent me to Egypt? Yeah, that's me.'\" } 5. So like, don't be all sad and mad at yourselves for selling me out here, 'cause God totally sent me ahead of you to like, save lives and stuff. And seriously, don't be angry, like, in your eyes or anything. 6. So, like, for the past two years, there has been this major famine going on, and get this, it's gonna last for another five years! Can you believe it? Like, during these five years, there won't be any planting or harvesting happening at all. It's gonna be pretty tough, man. 7. God totally sent me ahead of you to make sure you guys have future generations and to save your lives through a major rescue mission. Like, He wanted to keep a small group of you safe and stuff, you know? 8. Okay, listen up fam, it wasn't you who sent me here, but God himself. He's the one who made me the big boss in Pharaoh's crib and in charge of everything in Egypt. 9. Hey, hurry up and go to my dad. Tell him, like, I'm Joseph and God has made me the ruler of all Egypt. He needs to come down to me ASAP, no time to waste. 10. So, like, you're gonna live in this rad place called Goshen, and it's gonna be super close to me. Like, you, your kids, your grandkids, all your animals, and everything you own will totally be there too. No worries! 11. And I will take care of you there, because there are still five years of famine ahead. I don't want you, your family, or anything you own to suffer from poverty. 12. Yo, check it out! You and my bro Benjamin can see with your own eyes that it's me, your boy, who's speaking to you right now. 13. Yo, make sure you fill my dad in on all the sick stuff that's been happening here in Egypt, and everything you've witnessed. And yo, don't waste any time. Hurry up and bring my dad down here already. 14. And he hugged his brother Benjamin so tight, and they both started crying on each other's shoulders. 15. Then he gave all his bros a heartfelt hug, shedding some tears of joy for them. And right after that, they all had a good convo together. 16. News got out that Joseph's brothers had arrived at Pharaoh's house, and Pharaoh and his crew were stoked about it. 17. Pharaoh was like, 'Yo, Joseph, tell your bros to load up their animals and hit the road to Canaan.' 18. Yo, gather up your pops and your whole crew and roll up to my crib. I got you covered with all the good stuff in Egypt, and we gonna feast like kings. 19. Yo, here's the deal: you gotta do what you've been told. Grab some wheels from Egypt for your kids and wives, bring your old man and come on over. 20. Don't just focus on your things, because the prosperity of all Egypt belongs to you. Don't hold back or hesitate in sharing the wealth. 21. So the Israelites did as Joseph told them, and he supplied them with wagons, just as Pharaoh had ordered. He also gave them plenty of food for the journey. 22. He gave each person some cool new clothes, but Benjamin got three hundred bucks and five outfit changes! 23. And he sent his father a DM like this: ten totally stacked donkeys loaded with the yummiest Egyptian stuff, and ten chill donkeys loaded with corn, bread, and meat for his dad on the journey. #donkeygoals 24. And then he told his bros to bounce, and they dipped. He was like, yo, make sure y'all don't start beefin' on the way. 25. So they left Egypt and arrived in the land of Canaan, where their father Jacob was. 26. So they went and told him, like, Yo dude, Joseph's still kickin' and he's like the boss man, running the whole show in Egypt. And Jacob was like, whoa man, I can't even handle this, he couldn't believe what he was hearing. 27. So they filled him in on everything Joseph had said to them. And when Jacob saw the cool rides Joseph had sent to pick him up, he felt a surge of hope and joy. 28. Israel was like, alright, I've had my fill. My son Joseph is still kickin', so I'm gonna pay him a visit before I kick the bucket.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 451. Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. 2. And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. {wept...: Heb. gave forth his voice in weeping} 3. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I {am} Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. {troubled: or, terrified} 4. And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I {am} Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. 5. Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. {nor...: Heb. neither let there be anger in your eyes} 6. For these two years {hath} the famine {been} in the land: and yet {there are} five years, in the which {there shall} neither {be} earing nor harvest. 7. And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. {to preserve...: Heb. to put for you a remnant} 8. So now {it was} not you {that} sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. 9. Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: 10. And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: 11. And there will I nourish thee; for yet {there are} five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty. 12. And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that {it is} my mouth that speaketh unto you. 13. And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. 14. And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. 15. Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him. 16. And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. {pleased...: Heb. was good in the eyes of Pharaoh} 17. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; 18. And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. 19. Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. 20. Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt {is} yours. {regard...: Heb. let not your eye spare, etc.} 21. And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. {commandment: Heb. mouth} 22. To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred {pieces} of silver, and five changes of raiment. 23. And to his father he sent after this {manner}; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way. {laden...: Heb. carrying} 24. So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. 25. And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, 26. And told him, saying, Joseph {is} yet alive, and he {is} governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he believed them not. {Jacob's: Heb. his} 27. And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: 28. And Israel said, {It is} enough; Joseph my son {is} yet alive: I will go and see him before I die. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 461. So Israel packed up all his stuff and headed to Beersheba. When he got there, he made some offerings to the same God his dad, Isaac, worshipped. 2. So, like, God came through to Israel in, like, a super intense dream and was all like, 'Jacob, Jacob.' And Jacob was like, 'Yo, I'm right here.'\" } 3. And God said, yo, I'm like, God, the same God that your dad worships. Don't trip about going to Egypt, 'cause I'm gonna hook you up and make your descendants a super dope nation. 4. I got your back, fam. I'll roll with you to Egypt and for sure bring you back. Joseph gonna be there to close your eyes when it's time. 5. So Jacob left Beersheba, and his sons, along with their kids and wives, helped him move using the wagons that Pharaoh sent for the journey. 6. So, they brought their livestock and all the stuff they acquired in Canaan and went to Egypt. Jacob and all his fam rolled up too. Like, they were together and all. 7. He brought all of his kids, grandkids, daughters, and granddaughters, along with all his descendants, to Egypt with him. 8. So, like, these are the names of the homies from Israel who went to Egypt: Jacob and his crew -- Reuben, who's the firstborn of Jacob. 9. And Reuben had these sons: Hanoch, Phallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 10. So the Simeon dudes were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, who had a Canaanite mom. (Jemuel could also be called Nemuel. Jachin could also be called Jarib. Zohar could also be called Zerah.) 11. So, like, Levi had three sons, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Oh, and just a heads up, Gershon is sometimes called Gershom. 12. Now Judah had five sons: Er, Onan, Shelah, Pharez, and Zerah. Unfortunately, Er and Onan passed away while they were in Canaan. Pharez, on the other hand, had two sons named Hezron and Hamul. 13. The bros of Issachar were Tola, Phuvah, Job, and Shimron. {Phuvah and Job: also known as Puah and Jashub} 14. Soooo, check out the fam of Zebulun, they got Sered, Elon, and Jahleel, holding it down! 15. These are the kids of Leah, the ones she had with Jacob when they were in Padanaram, and their sister Dinah was included too. In total, there were thirty-three children, counting both sons and daughters. 16. The dudes from the tribe of Gad were Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. (Ziphion can also be called Zephon, and Ezbon can also be called Ozni, and Arodi can also be called Arod.) 17. Asher had some cool kids named Jimnah, Ishuah, Isui, and Beriah. They also had a rad sister named Serah. Beriah's sons were Heber and Malchiel. 18. These are the kids of Zilpah that Laban hooked up with Leah, and she had them with Jacob. There were a total of sixteen of them. 19. Rachel's sons were Joseph and Benjamin, they were Jacob's wife. 20. In Egypt, Joseph had two sons named Manasseh and Ephraim. Their mother was Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, who was a priest or leader in the city of On. 21. The dudes from Benjamin were Belah, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. BTW, Ehi might also go by Ahiram, Muppim could be Shupham or Shuppim, and Huppim could be Hupham. 22. Here are the kids Rachel had with Jacob: there were a total of fourteen. 23. And Dan had a few kids, Hushim was one of them. {Hushim: or, Shuham} 24. These are the peeps from the tribe of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. Y'all got some cool names, fam! 25. Here's a rundown of Bilhah's kids that Laban hooked Rachel up with. She gave birth to them for Jacob, and they made a total of seven peeps in the fam. 26. So, when Jacob and his crew made the move to Egypt, there were a total of 66 peeps (excluding Jacob's sons' wives) who joined the gang. Just a little FYI, the term 'loins' actually refers to Jacob's thigh in the Hebrew language. No cap! 27. And Joseph had two sons while he was in Egypt. The total number of people from Jacob's family who came to Egypt was seventy. 28. Then he asked Judah to go ahead of him to Joseph, to lead him to Goshen. And they arrived in the land of Goshen. 29. So Joseph got his ride ready and went to meet his dad, Israel, in Goshen. When they finally saw each other, Joseph hugged his dad real tight and they both cried for a good while. 30. Israel said to Joseph, I am ready to pass away now that I have seen your face, knowing that you are still alive. 31. So Joseph was like, 'Hey bros and fam, I'm gonna head up and tell Pharaoh that our peeps from Canaan are here with me.' 32. The dudes are like shepherds, cuz that's their gig - taking care of animals and stuff. They've brought all their flocks, herds, and everything they own with them. It's what they do for a living, ya know? 33. And it's gonna happen, when Pharaoh hits you up and goes, 'Yo, what's your hustle?' 34. So basically, we've been dealing with livestock since we were young, and our parents too. It's the way we've always made a living. This is why we can settle down in Goshen. You see, the Egyptians aren't really into the whole shepherd thing, they find it repulsive.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 461. And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac. 2.

And he said, I {am} God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: 4. I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up {again}: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. 5. And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 6. And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: 7. His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt. 8. And these {are} the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 9. And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. 10.

All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls {were} threescore and six; {loins: Heb. thigh} 27. And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, {were} two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, {were} threescore and ten. 28. And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 29. And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. 30. And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou {art} yet alive. 31. And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, which {were} in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; 32. And the men {are} shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. {their trade...: Heb. they are men of cattle} 33. And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What {is} your occupation? 34.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 471. So Joseph went and told Pharaoh, like, 'Yo, my dad and my bros, along with their animals and stuff, have come out of Canaan and now they're chilling in Goshen.'\" } 2. So he grabbed five of his friends and introduced them to Pharaoh. 3. Pharaoh was like, 'Yo, what do you guys do for a living?' And they were like, 'We're sheep herders, just like our ancestors, bro.'\" } 4. So we told Pharaoh that we came here to stay for a while because there's no good grazing land for our animals in Canaan. The famine is really bad over there. So, could you please let us live in the land of Goshen? 5. So Pharaoh talked to Joseph and said, 'Hey, your dad and your bros are here with you now!' 6. Hey, Egypt is all yours! Settle your dad and bros in the nicest part of the land, specifically in Goshen. And if you come across some skilled dudes, put them in charge of my cattle. 7. So Joseph brought his dad Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh. And Jacob gave Pharaoh his blessings. 8. Pharaoh was like, yo Jacob, how many years you been clockin'? Like, how many years have you lived on this earth? 9. Yo, Pharaoh, just so you know, I've been on this journey called life for a hundred and thirty years. But man, these years have been rough and short compared to the long and blessed lives of my ancestors during their time on Earth. 10. So Jacob gave his blessings to Pharaoh and then left his presence. 11. So Joseph found a rad spot in Egypt for his dad and bros in the land of Rameses, just like Pharaoh told him to. They got their own little piece of land, the prime real estate in Egypt. 12. So Joseph made sure his dad, his brothers, and all their family had enough bread to eat, taking into account each family's needs, just like when you take care of a little child. 13. So, like, there was legit zero bread anywhere in the whole land. It was a major famine, you know? Even Egypt and Canaan were totally wiped out because of it. 14. So, like, Joseph collected all the cash he found in Egypt and Canaan from selling the corn, and then he brought it back to Pharaoh's crib. 15. So like, when there was no more money in Egypt and Canaan, all the Egyptians went to Joseph and asked him for bread. They were like, 'Dude, why should we die while you're here? We're broke AF.'\" } 16. Yo, Joseph was like, 'Yo, hook me up with your livestock and I'll trade you some cash since money's running low.'\" } 17. So, they brought their cows to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in return for horses, flocks, herds, and donkeys. He provided them with enough bread to feed all their animals for that entire year. 18. After that first year, they approached him again in the second year and were like, 'Listen up, dude! We ain't gonna hide it from you. We're totally broke! You've got all our cash and livestock. We've got nothing left except ourselves and our land.' 19. Why should we suffer and watch ourselves and our land die? Can you supply us with food and buy our land, so that we and our land can serve Pharaoh? And please give us seeds, so that we can survive and prevent the land from becoming desolate. 20. So, like, Joseph straight up bought all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh! See, the Egyptians were selling their fields and stuff, 'cause this crazy famine was wrecking them. And guess what? Boom! The land ended up belonging to Pharaoh. It was wild! 21. And so, like, he basically relocated all the peeps, moving 'em to different cities from one side of Egypt to the other. 22. He didn't buy any land from the priests because they already had their own piece of land that Pharaoh gave them, and they ate from it. That's why they didn't sell their property. 23. So Joseph was like, yo guys, check it out, I just got you and your land on behalf of Pharaoh. And I got some seeds for you too, so you can start planting and stuff. 24. When the harvest comes, you gotta give one-fifth to Pharaoh, and four-fifths are yours to keep. Use it for planting crops, feeding yourselves, taking care of your families, and making sure the little ones have enough to eat. 25. And they were like, dude, you totally saved our lives! We hope you're cool with us and we would be totally down to work for Pharaoh if that's cool with you, my lord. 26. So Joseph established a rule in Egypt that is still followed today, where Pharaoh receives one-fifth of everything produced, except for the land belonging to the priests. They do not belong to Pharaoh. 27. So basically, Israel was living it up in Egypt, specifically in this place called Goshen. They were doing pretty well for themselves, got some nice stuff, and their numbers were growing like crazy. 28. So Jacob stayed in Egypt for seventeen years, and he lived to be one hundred forty-seven years old in total. #justlivin'life 29. The day approached when it was time for Israel to pass away. So he called his son Joseph and said to him, 'If I have earned your favor, can you please promise me this? Place your hand under my thigh as a sign of trust and treat me with kindness and honesty. Please don't bury me in Egypt'. 30. But when I pass away, I want you to take me out of Egypt and lay me to rest alongside my ancestors. And he replied, saying, I will do exactly as you have requested. 31. And he was like, dude, promise me, and he was like, yeah, I promise. And Israel was all humble and respectful.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 471. Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they {are} in the land of Goshen. 2. And he took some of his brethren, {even} five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh. 3. And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What {is} your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants {are} shepherds, both we, {and} also our fathers. 4. They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine {is} sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen. 5. And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: 6. The land of Egypt {is} before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest {any} men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle. 7. And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 8. And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old {art} thou? {How...: Heb. How many are the days of the years of thy life?} 9. And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage {are} an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage. 10. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh. 11. And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 12. And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to {their} families. {according...: or, as a little child is nourished: Heb. according to the little ones} 13. And {there was} no bread in all the land; for the famine {was} very sore, so that the land of Egypt and {all} the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine. 14. And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house. 15. And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money faileth. 16. And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail. 17. And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave them bread {in exchange} for horses, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year. {fed...: Heb. led them} 18. When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide {it} from my lord, how that our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle; there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands: 19. Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give {us} seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate. 20. And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's. 21. And as for the people, he removed them to cities from {one} end of the borders of Egypt even to the {other} end thereof. 22. Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests had a portion {assigned them} of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their lands. {priests: or, princes} 23. Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, {here is} seed for you, and ye shall sow the land. 24. And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give the fifth {part} unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones. 25. And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. 26. And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, {that} Pharaoh should have the fifth {part}; except the land of the priests only, {which} became not Pharaoh's. {priests: or, princes} 27. And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and multiplied exceedingly. 28. And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years. {the whole...: Heb. the days of the years of his life} 29. And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: 30. But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. 31. And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 481. So, like, there was this time when someone came up to Joseph and was like, 'Yo dude, your dad's sick and stuff.' And then Joseph was all, Wordd?' and he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, and went to see his dad. 2. Someone went up to Jacob and said, 'Yo, check it, your son Joseph is heading your way.' And Israel, feeling pumped up, took a seat on the bed. 3. So Jacob was like, 'Yo Joseph, listen up! God, the Ultimate Power, straight up showed up to me in Luz, in Canaan, and blessed me big time.' 4. And then he told me, listen up, I'm gonna make you super successful and make you multiply like crazy. You're gonna become a huge community of people, and this land will be passed down to your descendants forever, like a never-ending possession. 5. And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you in Egypt before I came to Egypt, are now mine. They will be treated as if they were my own sons, just like Reuben and Simeon. 6. And the kids you have after them will be yours, and they'll be known by the name of their siblings when it comes to inheriting. 7. And like, dude, when I was coming back from Padan, Rachel passed away, you know, she died, in Canaan, on our journey. We were so close to reaching Ephrath, just a little way left. So, I buried her there on the road to Ephrath, which is actually Bethlehem. 8. And Israel saw Joseph's sons and was like, who dis? 9. So Joseph was like, 'Yo dad, these are my boys that God hooked me up with here.' And he was like, 'Yo, bring 'em over here and I'll give 'em my blessings.'\" } 10. Israel's eyes were getting old and he couldn't see very well. He brought them close to him and gave them a kiss and a warm hug. 11. And Israel was like, 'Yo Joseph, I never thought I'd see your face again, but yo, God just blessed me by letting me see your fam too.'\" } 12. And Joseph helped them up from his lap and respectfully bowed down with his face to the ground. 13. Then Joseph grabbed both of them. He raised Ephraim in his right hand, closer to Israel's left hand, and he held Manasseh in his left hand, closer to Israel's right hand. And he brought them close to him. 14. Israel reached out his right hand and placed it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger one. Then he placed his left hand on Manasseh's head, intentionally guiding his hands. This was because Manasseh was the firstborn. 15. And he gave Joseph his blessing, saying, the God that my fathers Abraham and Isaac worshiped, the God who has provided for me throughout my whole life until now, 16. May the Angel who saved me from all harm bless these young ones. May they carry my name, and the names of my forefathers Abraham and Isaac. May they thrive and multiply, just like fish in the ocean. 17. So, like, Joseph noticed that his dad was putting his right hand on Ephraim's head and it totally bothered him. He actually tried to move his dad's hand from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. Can you believe it? Joseph was not cool with that at all. 18. And Joseph was like, 'Hold up, dad. Nah, that's not it. Reuben is the oldest, so you gotta put your right hand on his head.'\" } 19. But his dad was like, nah, I already know, my dude, I already know. So, check it, he's totally gonna make it big and become a whole nation. But the real deal is, his younger bro is gonna be even greater than him, and his future descendants will multiply into a bunch of nations. Yeah, like a whole bunch! 20. And he gave them his blessing that day, saying, 'In you, Israel will utter this blessing: May God make you as successful as Ephraim and Manasseh.' And he placed Ephraim before Manasseh. 21. And Israel was like, 'Yo, Joseph, I'm about to kick the bucket, but don't sweat it. God's got your back and will bring you back to the land of your ancestors.'\"}``` 22. Plus, I hooked you up with an extra share compared to your siblings. I totally snatched it from the Amorites, using my trusty sword and bow.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 481. And it came to pass after these things, that {one} told Joseph, Behold, thy father {is} sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 2. And {one} told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. 3. And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 4. And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee {for} an everlasting possession. 5. And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, {are} mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine. 6. And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, {and} shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance. 7. And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet {there was} but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same {is} Bethlehem. 8. And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who {are} these? 9. And Joseph said unto his father, They {are} my sons, whom God hath given me in this {place}. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. 10. Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, {so that} he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. {dim: Heb. heavy} 11. And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. 12. And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. 13. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought {them} near unto him. 14. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid {it} upon Ephraim's head, who {was} the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh {was} the firstborn. 15. And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, 16. The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. {grow: Heb. as fishes do increase} 17. And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head. {displeased...: was evil in his eyes} 18. And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this {is} the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. 19. And his father refused, and said, I know {it}, my son, I know {it}: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. {multitude: Heb. fulness} 20. And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. 21. And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. 22. Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. \n",
      "Gen Z: Genesis 491. So Jacob got his boys together and was like, 'Yo, come here, I gotta spill some truth about what's gonna go down in the future.'\" } 2. Yo, fam, come through and listen up, all you descendants of Jacob; pay attention to your father Israel. 3. Reuben, you're like my OG, you've got that natural strength, the ultimate source of my power, the epitome of honor and authority, and totally boss with all that strength you’ve got! 4. You're all over the place, never gonna make it big; 'cause you totally crossed the line by hooking up with your dad's partner. Yeah, you messed up big time and now it's a total mess. 5. Simeon and Levi are like siblings; they've got some intense energy in their living spaces. Their swords can get pretty wild, you know, like powerful tools of aggression. 6. Yo, listen up. Don't get involved with their sneaky schemes, don't join their crew, 'cause they straight up killed a guy out of anger and wrecked a wall just 'cause they felt like it. 7. Their anger was seriously messed up, like, no vibes at all. And their wrath? Straight up savage and heartless. Gonna split them up within the Jacob fam and spread 'em out throughout all of Israel. 8. Yo, Judah, you're the one who's gonna be praised by your bros. You'll have control over your enemies and your siblings will show respect by bowing down to you. 9. Judah is like a young lion, fierce and full of courage. He has risen from conquering his enemies, my son. With the strength and wisdom of a lion, he crouches down and waits patiently, ready to defend his pride. Who dares to challenge him? 10. The ruler role will stay with Judah until Shiloh arrives, and everyone will come together under their leadership. 11. Tying his cool ride to the epic vine, and his cute donkey's baby to the super fancy vine; he cleansed his fit outfits in rad wine, and his clothes in the legit blood of grapes: 12. His eyes will be bloodshot from sipping on wine, and his teeth will be pearly white from enjoying milk. 13. Zebulun will chill by the seaside, rockin' it as a sick spot for ships, and his turf extends all the way to Zidon. 14. Issachar is like a chill donkey chilling out between two heavy loads: 15. And he thought, 'Wow, taking a break is pretty awesome, and this place is like, super nice!' So he willingly took on responsibilities and became a servant, like, paying tribute to someone. 16. Dan will be in charge of his people, like one of the tribes of Israel. 17. Dan's gonna be like a sneaky snake slithering around, a venomous serpent on the road, biting at the horse's heels, causing the rider to fall back. (FYI, the Hebrew word for 'adder' means 'arrow-snake'.) 18. I've been patiently waiting for Your rescue, LORD. 19. Yo, Gad is gonna get hit by a whole squad, but don't trip 'cause he gonna come out on top in the end. 20. Asher's food will be top-tier, with a major dough and high-class delicacies. 21. {\n",

Like, lowkey, those branches are kinda like his sisters, you feel me? 23. The archers really upset him, took shots at him, and had a lot of hatred towards him: 24. But his bow stayed strong, and his hands were made mighty by the powerful hands of the awesome {God} of Jacob; (from there came the shepherd, the rockstar of Israel:)\" } 25. By the God of your pops, who's got your back; and by the Almighty, who's gonna shower you with mad blessings from up in the sky, blessings from deep below, blessings from nurturing mammas and fertile wombs. 26.

OK, so check it out: Benjamin's gonna go all wolf mode--like, hungry and ready to feast. Come morning, he's gonna devour that prey like a champ. And by night, he'll be sharin' the spoils with the crew. 28. So, all these peeps are the twelve tribes of Israel, ya know? And this is what their dad said to them, and he gave 'em his blessings—each one got their own special blessing. 29. And he told them, and said to them, I'm about to join my people. When I pass away, make sure to bury me with my ancestors in the cave located in Ephron the Hittite's field, 30. So there's this cool cave in the field of Machpelah, you know? It's right before Mamre, in Canaan, totally owned by Abraham. He bought it from Ephron the Hittite for a legit burial spot, no joke. 31. Abraham and his wifey Sarah were laid to rest there, along with Isaac and his wifey Rebekah. And, just so you know, that's where I laid my girl Leah to rest too. 32. So, like, Abraham bought a field and a cave from the guys known as the children of Heth. 33.

      "KJV: Genesis 491. And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you {that} which shall befall you in the last days. 2.

Reuben, thou {art} my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 4. Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou {it}: he went up to my couch. {thou shalt...: Heb. do not thou excel} {he went...: or, my couch is gone} 5. Simeon and Levi {are} brethren; instruments of cruelty {are in} their habitations. {instruments...: or, their swords are weapons of violence} 6. O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall. {digged...: or, houghed oxen} 7.

      "Gen Z: Genesis 501. Then Joseph went to his dad, and he couldn't hold back his tears. He gave him a heartfelt hug and planted a kiss on his cheek. 2. So, Joseph told his squad of doctors to preserve his dad's body, and they went ahead and embalmed Israel. 3. And after forty days, they completed the embalming process, which is the customary practice. The Egyptians mourned for him for a total of seventy days. 4. And after Joseph finished mourning, he talked to Pharaoh's crew and said, 'Yo, if I've earned your respect, lemme speak up and make a request to Pharaoh, like, 5. So, my dad told me, 'Hey, listen up. I'm about to kick the bucket and I've already prepared my own grave in Canaan. That's where I want you to bury me. So, please let me go up there and give him a proper burial. Don't worry, I'll be back.'\" } 6. Pharaoh was like, 'Yo, go and give your pops a proper burial, just like you promised.' 7. So Joseph went to bury his dad, and all of Pharaoh's crew, along with the OGs of his crib and all the OGs of Egypt, went up with him. 8. And all of Joseph's fam, his siblings, and his father's fam were with him. They only left their young kiddos, their animals and their livestock back in the land of Goshen. 9. And like, there were like, a bunch of chariots and horsemen rollin' with him, and dude, let me tell you, it was a freaking massive crew! 10. So they arrived at the threshingfloor of Atad, which is on the other side of the river, and they began to mourn very intensely, expressing their sorrow with great sadness. They honored their father by mourning for a whole week. 11. So, like, when the peeps who lived in Canaan saw the Egyptians grieving at Atad, they were like, dang, this mourning is super intense. That's why they named the place Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. Abelmizraim means the mourning of the Egyptians, ya know. 12. And his sons followed his instructions just as he told them to do: 13. His sons took him to the land of Canaan and laid him to rest in the cave of the field of Machpelah. This cave was bought by Abraham as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite, near Mamre. 14. So like, after Joseph buried his father, he went back to Egypt with his brothers and all the peeps who went with them to bury him. 15. So, like, when Joseph's bros saw that their dad had passed away, they were like, 'OMG, Joseph's totally gonna hate us now and totally gonna pay us back for all the mean stuff we did to him.'\" } 16. So, like, they messaged Joseph and were all like, 'Yo, your dad straight up told us before he kicked the bucket, he was all like, Josephh, listen up, I'm charging you with a mission.'\" } 17. Yo, Joseph, could you please forgive your bros for the messed up stuff they did to you? They did some straight up evil. We're asking you, please forgive them for the mistakes made by the people who serve your dad's God. Joseph got all emotional and started crying when they talked to him like that. 18. And his siblings also went and bowed down before him; and they said, Look, we are here to serve you. 19. And Joseph was like, yo don't be stressed out. Cos like, am I, some regular dude, supposed to take over God's job or what? 20. But yo, you were hating on me, straight up evil thoughts and all. But, check it, God had a whole different plan in mind. He turned that negativity into a positive outcome, making it all happen just like it is today. And the result? Saving so many lives, man. 21. So don't be afraid, guys. I'll take care of you and your kiddos. He made them feel better and spoke with love to them. {kindly...: Heb. to their hearts} 22. So, like, Joseph stayed in Egypt along with his fam, you know, his dad's crew. And Joseph totally rocked the earth for a sweet 110 years, man! 23. And Joseph peeped Ephraim's grandkids who were three times removed: the kiddos of Machir, Manasseh's offspring, were chillin' on Joseph's lap. #familybonding 24. So, like, Joseph was talking to his bros and he was like, 'Yo, guys, I'm about to dip from this world'. But, like, don't trip, 'cause God's got your back! He's totally gonna come through and take you outta here, to the same land He promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ya know? 25. So, Joseph made the Israelite peeps promise, like, for real, that God's gonna come check them out, and when that happens, they gotta make sure to bring my bones up outta here. 26. So like, Joseph passed away when he was, like, a hundred and ten years old. And then they, like, preserved his body and put him in a fancy box in Egypt.\"} \n",
      "KJV: Genesis 501. And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him. 2. And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel. 3. And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days. {mourned: Heb. wept} 4. And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 5. My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. 6. And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. 7. And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 8. And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. 9. And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. 10. And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which {is} beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. 11. And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This {is} a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which {is} beyond Jordan. {Abelmizraim: that is, The mourning of the Egyptians} 12. And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: 13. For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. 14. And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. 15. And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. 16. And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, {sent: Heb. charged} 17. So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. 18. And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we {be} thy servants. 19. And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for {am} I in the place of God? 20. But as for you, ye thought evil against me; {but} God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as {it is} this day, to save much people alive. 21. Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. {kindly...: Heb. to their hearts} 22. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 23. And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third {generation}: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees. {brought...: Heb. born} 24. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 25. And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. 26.

      "Gen Z: Exodus 11. So, here's the deal. These are the names of the children of Israel who made their way to Egypt. Each person, along with their fam, rolled with Jacob. 2. Yo, fam! Check out these OG brothers: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 3. Issa, Zeb, and Benji, 4. Yo, it's Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 5. So, like, all the people who came from Jacob's fam were like seventy in total, 'cause Joseph was already livin' it up in Egypt, you know? Oh, and when it says 'loins', it actually means 'thigh' in Hebrew, just an FYI. 6. And Joseph passed away, along with all his squad, and everyone from that OG crew. 7. So, like, the Israelite kids were totally productive and grown big time, and they multiplied like crazy, becoming super strong; and the whole land was, like, totally packed with them. 8. So basically, there was this new ruler in Egypt who had no clue who Joseph was. 9. Yo, listen up fam, check this out: Them Israelites, man, they be mad deep and straight up powerful compared to us, ya know? 10. Alright, listen up, let's handle this situation smartly; otherwise, they might increase in numbers and if a war breaks out, they might team up with our enemies and end up leaving our land. 11. So they appointed supervisors to make them suffer under heavy workloads. And they constructed cities of wealth, Pithom and Raamses, for Pharaoh. 12. But like, the more they messed with the Israelites, the more they multiplied and thrived. And, it totally annoyed them because of the big Israelite fam. 13. So, like, the Egyptians totally forced the Israelites to work super hard and be slaves and stuff:  14. And they made life miserable for them with tough, grueling work. They forced them to work with morter, bricks, and all sorts of labor in the fields. Every task they were given was filled with harshness and severity. 15. So, like, the pharaoh dude in Egypt had a chat with these two Hebrew midwives, ya know? One was named Shiphrah and the other was called Puah. Pretty simple, right? 16. And he was like, when you're helping the Hebrew ladies give birth and you see them on the birthing stools, if it's a boy, you gotta like, kill him. But if it's a girl, then she can keep on living. 17. But the midwives were totally in awe of God, and they were like, 'Nah, no way are we gonna do what the king of Egypt told us to do!' They made sure to keep all the baby boys safe and sound. 18. So the Pharaoh summoned the midwives and asked them, like, why did you let those baby boys live? What's the deal? 19. So the midwives told Pharaoh, like, the Hebrew women are just different from the Egyptian women, you know? They're so energetic and give birth really quickly, even before we get a chance to show up. 20. So God totally blessed the midwives, and the population blew up and became super strong. 21. So, like, because the midwives were pretty scared of God and stuff, He was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna give you guys some fancy houses.' 22. So Pharaoh told everyone, like, hear me out guys, I want you to throw all the baby boys into the river, but, like, save all the baby girls, okay? \n",

And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt {already}. {loins: Heb. thigh} 6. And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. 7. And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. 8. Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. 9. And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel {are} more and mightier than we: 10. Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and {so} get them up out of the land. 11. Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. 12. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. {But...: Heb. And as they afflicted them, so they multiplied, etc} 13. And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: 14. And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, {was} with rigour. 15. And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one {was} Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 16. And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see {them} upon the stools; if it {be} a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it {be} a daughter, then she shall live. 17. But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. 18. And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? 19. And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women {are} not as the Egyptian women; for they {are} lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. 20. Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. 21. And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. 22. And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 21. So this guy from the Levi fam ended up marrying a girl from the same fam. 2. And the woman got pregnant and had a baby boy. When she saw how awesome he looked, she kept him hidden for three months. 3. So, when she couldn't hide him anymore, she grabbed a fancy raft and gave it a makeover with some sticky stuff. Then, she tucked the baby inside and gently placed it among the reeds by the river's edge. 4. And his sis was like watching from a distance, curious to see what was gonna happen to him. 5. So like, the Pharaoh's daughter went to the river to take a dip, with her girls nearby. And guess what? She spotted this cool floating thing in the reeds. She was like, 'Go grab that thing,' and sent one of her girls to get it. 6. And when she looked inside, she saw the baby crying. It touched her heart, and she said, 'This is one of the Hebrews' kids.' 7. So the sister was like, 'Hey Pharaoh's daughter, should I find a Hebrew lady to take care of the baby for you?' 8. Pharaoh's daughter was like, 'Sure, go ahead.' So the maid dipped and hit up the child's actual mom. 9. Pharaoh's daughter was like, 'Yo, take this kid and raise him for me, and I'll hook you up with some cash.' So the woman grabbed the baby and did the nursing thing. 10. As the kid grew up, the woman took him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he officially became her son. She named him Moses, and explained that it was because she saved him from the water. 11. So, like, back in the day when Moses became all grown up and stuff, he went out to hang with his homies, and he saw how much they were struggling with their loads. And guess what? He caught this Egyptian dude hitting a Hebrew, who was actually part of his squad. Can you believe it? 12. So, he like, checked out both sides, and when he realized there was no one around, he straight up took down the Egyptian bro and buried him in the sand. 13. So, like, the next day this guy goes out and, whoa, he sees these two Hebrew dudes going all out, arguing and stuff. And he's like, yo dude who started it, why you gotta be hitting your bro like that? 14. And he was like, 'Yo, who made you the boss and the judge over us? Are you trying to end me like you did to that Egyptian dude?' And Moses got scared and was like, 'Dang, this is gonna get out, isn't it?' 15. So, like, when Pharaoh found out about what Moses did, he was totally out for blood. But Moses bailed and escaped Pharaoh's wrath, and ended up chilling in Midian. And you know what? He just plopped himself down by a well and kicked it there. 16. So, this dude who was like a priest in Midian had these seven daughters and they went to draw some water and fill up the troughs to water their dad's flock. (By the way, the word priestt' could also mean 'prince' here.) 17. So, like, the shepherds were there and they were all being annoying and stuff, but then Moses was like, 'Nah fam, I got you!' He came to the rescue, helped them out, and made sure their sheep were taken care of. No worries, fam. 18. When they arrived at their dad Reuel, he was like, 'How'd you guys get here so fast today?' (P.S. Reuel is also known as Jethro or Jether) 19. They were like, OMG, this totally fine Egyptian guy saved us from those shepherds and even hooked us up with enough H2O for everyone and watered the whole flock. Like, power moves! 20. He was like, 'Yo, where's that guy at? Why did y'all leave him? Go get him so he can grab a bite to eat.' 21. Moses was totally vibing with the guy and decided to hang out. The guy was like, 'Bro, you're cool. Have my daughter Zipporah as a gift.' 22. And she had a baby boy, and he gave him the name Gershom. Because he felt like an outsider in a totally unfamiliar place. (Gershom means 'a stranger here') 23. So, like, after a while, the pharaoh of Egypt passed away, and the Israelite peeps were totally fed up with being enslaved. They couldn't take it anymore, ya know? They cried out in desperation, and their cries reached God because of the super harsh slavery and all. 24. And God was like: I hear you, fam. And God was like, 'yo, I remember the deal I made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' 25. And God saw the Israelites and was like, 'Hey, I'm feeling them vibes.' \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 21. And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took {to wife} a daughter of Levi. 2. And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he {was a} goodly {child}, she hid him three months. 3. And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid {it} in the flags by the river's brink. 4. And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. 5. And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash {herself} at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 6. And when she had opened {it}, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This {is one} of the Hebrews' children. 7. Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 8. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. 9. And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give {thee} thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. 10. And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. {Moses: that is, Drawn out} 11. And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 12. And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that {there was} no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 13. And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 14. And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. {a prince: Heb. a man, a prince} 15. Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. 16. Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew {water}, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. {priest: or, prince} 17. And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. 18. And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How {is it that} ye are come so soon to day? {Reuel: called also Jethro, or, Jether} 19. And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew {water} enough for us, and watered the flock. 20. And he said unto his daughters, And where {is} he? why {is} it {that} ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. 21. And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. 22. And she bare {him} a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. {Gershom: that is, A stranger here} 23. And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 24. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 25. And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto {them}. {had...: Heb. knew} \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 31. Yo, Moses was looking after Jethro's flock, who was his father-in-law and a priest of Midian. He took the flock to a chill spot in the desert and ended up at God's mountain, also known as Horeb. 2. So like, the LORD's angel showed up to him in this sick flame of fire that was like coming out of this bush. And he looked, right, and like, the bush was legit on fire but it wasn't getting destroyed or anything. It was wild. 3. So Moses was like, 'Yo, I gotta check this out. Why is this bush on fire but not getting roasted?' 4. And when the LORD peeped that he was curious to check it out, God hit him up from the epicenter of the bush and was like, Mosess, Moses.' Then he was like, 'Here I am.' 5. And he was like, yeah bro, don't come closer, take off your shoes, dude. This place you're standing on is like, super sacred and stuff. 6. Yo, he was like, 'Just so you know, I'm your dad's God. The same God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' Moses was totally shook and covered his face 'cause he was too scared to even look at God. 7. Yo, God was like, I totally peeped the struggles of my squad in Egypt and heard their cries because of their bosses. Trust me, I know they're going through some tough times. 8. So like, I'm totally here to rescue them from those Egyptians and take them to this amazing land, dude! It's like super lush and abundant, overflowing with milk and honey, you know? It's where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites are hanging out, by the way. 9. So, listen up, guys! The Israelites are reaching out to me, and let me tell ya, I've totally noticed how the Egyptians are treating them, all oppressive and stuff. 10. Hey, listen up! Time to make moves - I'm about to send you straight to Pharaoh's doorstep. Your mission? Free the children of Israel from Egypt, no less! 11. Yo, God, why me? Like, who am I to go to Pharaoh and free the Israelites from Egypt? 12. And he was like, totally down to hang with you. And here's how you'll know I sent you: Once you've rescued the peeps from Egypt, you'll worship God on this sick mountain. 13. So Moses was like, yo God, listen up. When I go to the Israelites and tell them, 'Hey, the God our ancestors believed in sent me to you', and they're like, 'What's His name, dude?'. What should I tell 'em? 14. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, I'm all about that self-existence, I just am who I am, you know? So tell the Israelite kids that I'm the one who sent you, like, I exist and stuff.' 15. Yo, Moses, God got another message for ya. Tell the Israel squad that the OG LORD God of your fam - Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - sent me to deliver a message. This is gonna be my name forever, a constant reminder for all future generations. 16. Yo, go and gather all the OGs of Israel and tell 'em: The LORD God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, came through and appeared to me. He said, 'I've legit checked out what's been going down with you in Egypt.' 17. I promise to rescue you from all the tough times in Egypt and take you to a dope land filled with the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. It's gonna be lit, flowing with milk and honey! 18. And they'll totally listen to what you're saying, and you're gonna roll up, along with the OGs of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you're gonna be like, 'Yo, the LORD God of the Hebrews has been vibing with us, and now we're asking you, can we dip for a three-day trip into the wild, just to make some sacrifices to the LORD our God?' 19. I'm totally confident that the king of Egypt won't set you free, not even with a massive display of force. {or, but with a strong show of power} 20. And then I'm gonna flex, and hit Egypt with all my epic miracles that I'm gonna pull off right in the middle of it. And once that's done, he's gonna finally let you bounce. 21. And I'll make sure these peeps get mad respect from the Egyptians: and trust, when you bounce, you won't be left empty-handed: 22. Every girl can ask her friend or the girl staying in her house for some cool silver and gold accessories and trendy clothes. Then you can totally make your sons and daughters look fly by decking them out with those stuff, and snag all the sweet loot from the Egyptians. (the Egyptians: or, Egypt) \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 31. Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, {even} to Horeb. 2. And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush {was} not consumed. 3. And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. 4. And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here {am} I. 5. And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest {is} holy ground. 6. Moreover he said, I {am} the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God. 7. And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which {are} in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 8. And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 9. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. 10. Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. 11. And Moses said unto God, Who {am} I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? 12. And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this {shall be} a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. 13. And Moses said unto God, Behold, {when} I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What {is} his name? what shall I say unto them? 14. And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. 15. And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this {is} my name for ever, and this {is} my memorial unto all generations. 16. Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and {seen} that which is done to you in Egypt: 17. And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. 18. And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. 19. And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. {no...: or, but by strong hand} 20. And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. 21. And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty: 22. But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put {them} upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians. {the Egyptians: or, Egypt} \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 41. And Moses was like, umm, listen up, what if they don't believe me or listen to what I gotta say? They gonna be like, 'Nah, dude, the Big Guy upstairs didn't show Himself to you.' 2. And God was like, 'Yo, what's that thing you holding?' And he was like, 'Bro, it's a rod.' 3. Then he was like, 'Yo, throw it on the ground.' So he tossed it down, and it transformed into a snake. Moses straight up dipped and ran away from that thing. 4. So God said to Moses, just reach out your hand and grab it by the tail. And Moses did it, he reached out his hand, grabbed it, and it turned into a cool staff in his hand: 5. So they'll believe that the LORD God, the OG God of their ancestors – Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob – actually pulled up on you. 6. Then God told him to like, put his hand in his hoodie pocket, you know? So he did it and when he pulled it out, his hand was all covered in nasty leprosy, like super white and gross. 7. And he was like, 'Yo, put your hand back into your hoodie.' So dude put his hand back in and took it out, and yo, it was totally back to normal, like his other skin and stuff. 8. So like, if they don't believe you or listen to the first sign, they'll totally believe the second sign, you know? 9. If they don't even believe these two signs or listen to you, take some water from the river and pour it on the dry ground. Then that water you take from the river will totally turn into blood on the dry ground. 10. So Moses was like, 'Yo, God, I gotta be real with you. I ain't exactly the smoothest talker, never have been, even after you spoke to me. I struggle to find the right words and get my point across.' (Just so you know, 'eloquent' means a person who's good with words and 'heretofore' means since yesterday or even the day before that.) 11. And the LORD was like, 'Yo, who created our mouths? Like, who's responsible for making people unable to speak or hear or see or even go blind? Oh, right, it's me, the LORD. 12. So, like, go now and don't worry, I'll totally be with you and teach you what to say. 13. And he was like, yo Lord, just send someone already, like whoever you want to send bro. You know what I'm sayin', like you make the call or whatever. 14. So like, God got pretty mad at Moses, and He was all like, 'Yo, isn't Aaron your bro? I know he's a smooth talker and stuff. Plus, check it out, he's on his way to see you, and he's gonna be stoked when he sees you.' 15. Just talk to him and give him the words to say. I'll be there speaking through both of you, teaching you what to do. 16. He's gonna be your hype man for the squad, straight up. He'll be your voice when dealing with the people, kinda like your personal PR manager. You'll be his support, like a legit ride-or-die, and he'll hold you down like your personal divine connection. 17. Yo, grab this rod and work some insane miraculous stuff with it. 18. So Moses bounced back and went to his father-in-law Jethro. He was like, 'Yo, let me dip and go back to my peeps in Egypt. I need to check if they're still kicking.' Jethro was cool about it and told Moses to peace out. 19. Yo, Moses, listen up! The big man upstairs, the LORD, spoke to you when you were chillin' in Midian. He told you to head back to Egypt, 'cause all those dudes who wanted to take you out are now six feet under. 20. So Moses grabbed his wife and his kids, and they rode on a donkey as they went back to Egypt. And Moses made sure to bring along God's magical rod as well. 21. God was like, 'Yo, Moses, when you head back to Egypt, make sure you show Pharaoh all those cool miracles I gave you the power to do. But just a heads up, I'm gonna make sure Pharaoh's heart is stubborn so he won't let the people go.' 22. Yo, go tell Pharaoh that the LORD says Israel is like my OG child, the firstborn and all that. 23. Yo, listen up! I'm telling you, release my son so he can do his thing serving me. But if you straight up refuse to let him go, just know, I'm about to take out your firstborn, no joke. 24. So, like, this thing happened when this dude was staying at an inn, and then the LORD showed up and, like, had major beef with him and wanted to, you know, kill him. 25. So Zipporah grabbed a sharp tool and cut off her son's foreskin, then threw it at his feet. She said to Moses, 'You are truly a husband covered in blood to me.' 26. Bruh, he was like, Peacee out, dude.' And then she's all like, 'Dude, you're such a bloody hubby now because of that whole circumcision thing.' 27. And God was like, 'Yo Aaron, head to the wilderness and link up with Moses.' So Aaron dipped and they linked up at God's mountain, and they were like, 'Bro, good to see you!' and hugged it out. 28. So Moses told Aaron everything that the LORD had said to him and all the cool things he wanted Aaron to do. 29. So Moses and Aaron were like, 'Let's round up all the OGs of the Israelite squad:' 30. Yo, Aaron was like straight up speaking all the words that the LORD had spoken to Moses, and he even flexed with some mad signs in front of the people, you know? 31. And the people were like, totally convinced: and when they heard that the LORD had come through for the children of Israel, and that he was all like concerned about their struggles, then they were low-key in awe and showed mad respect by bowing their heads and worshiping. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 41. And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee. 2. And the LORD said unto him, What {is} that in thine hand? And he said, A rod. 3. And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 4. And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: 5. That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee. 6. And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand {was} leprous as snow. 7. And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his {other} flesh. 8. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. 9. And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour {it} upon the dry {land}: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry {land}. {shall become: Heb. shall be and shall be} 10. And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I {am} not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I {am} slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. {eloquent: Heb. a man of words} {heretofore: Heb. since yesterday, nor since the third day} 11. And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? 12. Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. 13. And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand {of him whom} thou wilt send. {wilt: or, shouldest} 14. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, {Is} not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. 15. And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. 16. And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, {even} he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. 17. And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs. 18. And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which {are} in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. {Jethro: Heb. Jether} 19. And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life. 20. And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. 21. And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. 22. And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel {is} my son, {even} my firstborn: 23. And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, {even} thy firstborn. 24. And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him. 25. Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast {it} at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband {art} thou to me. {sharp...: or, knife} {cast...: Heb. made it touch} 26. So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband {thou art}, because of the circumcision. 27. And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. 28. And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. 29. And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: 30. And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people. 31. And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 51. So Moses and Aaron entered, and they told Pharaoh, This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: Let my people go, so they can throw a lit celebration for me in the wilderness. 2. Pharaoh was like, who even is this LORD dude? Why should I listen to him and let Israel bounce? I have no clue who this LORD is, and I'm definitely not giving Israel freedom. 3. So they were like, 'Yo, the God of the Hebrews totally showed up, fam. Let's bounce and take, like, a three-day trip to the desert and offer sacrifices to the LORD our God. If we don't do this, we might catch some crazy plague or get rekt by swords.' 4. So the king of Egypt was like, why are you, Moses and Aaron, letting the people slack off from their work? Go back to your own responsibilities. 5. Yo, Pharaoh was like, check it out, there's a huge crowd here and y'all out here giving them a break from their hard work. 6. So Pharaoh like, straight up told the bosses and their peeps to get to work on this day, no delays or playing around, 7. You ain't gotta provide the people with straw to make bricks no more, like you used to. Just let 'em go and gather their own straw. 8. So, like, the deal is that those guys should still make the same number of bricks as before, not even one less because they're just chilling and complaining, saying that they wanna dip and worship their God. 9. Yo, give the dudes more tasks to hustle on, so they can grind it out and not waste time on dumb talk. #NoTimeForNonsense 10. So, like, the people in charge, you know, the taskmasters and officers, they went to talk to the people and were like, 'Yo, Pharaoh said he ain't gonna give you any straw, just so you know.' 11. Hey, go and grab some straw wherever you can find it, but don't worry, they won't reduce the amount of work you have to do. 12. So, all the people were scattered throughout the whole land of Egypt, looking for stubble instead of straw. 13. The bosses were like, 'Yo, hustle up and get your stuff done, your daily grind, just like when we had all the resources we needed. In a day's work, get it done!' 14. So, like, the bosses that Pharaoh put in charge of the Israelites totally gave them a hard time. They got punished and were all like, 'Why didn't you finish making bricks yesterday and today, like you used to?' 15. So, like, the leaders of the Israelites went up to Pharaoh and straight up asked him, 'Dude, seriously, why are you treating us like this?' 16. They didn't give us any straw, and now they're telling us to make bricks. And guess what? Your workers are beating us. But it's not our fault, it's your people's fault. 17. But he's like, dude, you're wallowing in laziness, seriously: that's why you're all like, 'Let's bounce and make a sacrifice to the LORD.' 18. So like, get to work ASAP! But yo, they're not gonna hook you up with any straw, but still, you gotta make sure to deliver those bricks, alright? 19. So, like, the leaders of the Israelite peeps realized that things were getting pretty bad when they were told they couldn't even reduce the amount of bricks they had to make each day. 20. So Moses and Aaron ran into each other, blocking the path, after they left Pharaoh's place: 21. And they were like, OMG, may the LORD low-key see what you did and judge you, because you, like, totally made Pharaoh and his squad hate us even more! They wanna come at us with their swords and, like, slay us. Such a total disaster, man! #Frustrated 22. So Moses goes back to God and is like, 'Yo, why are you treating these people so badly? What's the point of sending me here?' 23. Ever since I went to Pharaoh to convey your message, he has been straight up causing trouble for these peeps. And to be real, it seems like you haven't even come through to save your people at all. Like nada, zip, zero. #disappointed \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 51. And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness. 2. And Pharaoh said, Who {is} the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. 3. And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. 4. And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. 5. And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now {are} many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. 6. And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying, 7. Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves. 8. And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish {ought} thereof: for they {be} idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go {and} sacrifice to our God. 9. Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words. {Let there...: Heb. Let the work be heavy upon the men} 10. And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 11. Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished. 12. So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw. 13. And the taskmasters hasted {them}, saying, Fulfil your works, {your} daily tasks, as when there was straw. {your daily...: Heb. a matter of a day in his day} 14. And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, {and} demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore? 15. Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? 16. There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants {are} beaten; but the fault {is} in thine own people. 17. But he said, Ye {are} idle, {ye are} idle: therefore ye say, Let us go {and} do sacrifice to the LORD. 18. Go therefore now, {and} work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 19. And the officers of the children of Israel did see {that} they {were} in evil {case}, after it was said, Ye shall not minish {ought} from your bricks of your daily task. 20. And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 21. And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. {to be...: Heb. to stink} 22. And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou {so} evil entreated this people? why {is} it {that} thou hast sent me? 23. For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. {neither...: Heb. delivering thou hast not delivered} \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 61. And God was like, 'Yo, Moses, get ready to witness the epicness I'm about to unleash on Pharaoh. He's gonna be so shook that he'll be forced to let my people go, like, real forcefully and kick them all out of his territory with some serious power moves.' 2. And God like, talked to Moses and was all like, I am the LORD, you know, the almighty one and stuff, like JEHOVAH n' all. 3. So, like, I showed up to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, ya know? But, like, they didn't really know me by my name JEHOVAH. It wasn't, like, part of our vibe back then, you know what I'm saying? 4. And just FYI, I made a really tight agreement with them, promising to hook them up with the land of Canaan, you know, that spot where they were just wanderin' around like total newbies. 5. And yo, I've totally heard the struggle of the Israelite peeps, kept under the Egyptians' control. And you know what? I haven't forgotten about the covenant I made with them! 6. Yo, listen up Israelites! I'm the LORD and I'm about to flex on those Egyptians. I'm gonna free you from their heavy burdens, deliver you from their slavery, and save y'all with my mighty power and epic judgments. 7. And I'm gonna make you my peeps, like, you'll be my squad, and I'm gonna be your ultimate plug, you know? You'll totally realize that I'm the LORD your God, the one who's totally freeing you from all that slave labor in Egypt. 8. And I'll totally hook you up with that promised land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It's gonna be all yours, no doubt. I'm the boss, BTW. (Hebrew meaning high-five) 9. So Moses was like, 'Yo, fam, listen up' to the children of Israel. But they were not about to listen because they were hella stressed out and dealing with some seriously messed up oppression, you feel? Like, their spirits were crushed and they were caught up in this wickedly unfair situation. {anguish: You know, feeling totally cramped and trapped} 10. So, like, God talked to Moses and was all like, 11. Yo, go and talk to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and tell him to let the Israelites bounce outta his turf. 12. So, like, Moses was talking to God and he was all like, 'Dude, the Israelites aren't even listening to me! How am I supposed to get Pharaoh to listen when I'm not all eloquent and stuff?' 13. So, like, the LORD was talking to Moses and Aaron, and He was all like, 'Yo, I've got a mission for y'all. You gotta go to the children of Israel and Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and tell 'em to get the Israelites outta Egypt.' 14. These are the OG leaders of their families: The squad of Reuben, the oldest of Israel's sons; Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These are the fams of Reuben. 15. And Simeon's crew was lit, with Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul repping hard. Shaul's mom was a Canaanite, no cap. These were the homies rollin' with Simeon. 16. So, these are the names of the sons of Levi, you know, following their generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. And Levi lived for, like, a hundred and thirty-seven years, which is pretty impressive. 17. The squad of Gershon; Libni and Shimi, reppin' their own fams. 18. So, there were four dudes called Kohath's sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived for a solid 133 years. Like, that's a decent run, you know? 19. The fam of Levi had two chill dudes called Mahali and Mushi, who were the sons of Merari. That's the whole fam vibe sorted, yo. 20. And Amram decided to marry his aunt Jochebed, his father's sister. They had two sons named Aaron and Moses. Amram lived to be a super impressive one hundred and thirty-seven years old! 21. Izhar had some cool kids like Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. 22. And Uzziel had three sons: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Zithri. 23. And then Aaron got together with Elisheba, who was Amminadab's daughter and Naashon's sister, and they became a couple. They had four kids named Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 24. And the squad of Korah was lit with Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph in the fam gang. This be the crew of the Korhites, no cap. 25. And then Eleazar, Aaron's son, married one of the daughters of Putiel, and they had Phinehas. These are the OG leaders of the Levites, representing their fams. 26. So, like, these dudes Aaron and Moses, the LORD was all like, yo, tell the children of Israel to bounce from Egypt with their squads. 27. Yo, these are the peeps who talked to Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, and convinced him to let the Israelite kids bounce from that place. Moses and Aaron were the ones making it happen. 28. So, like, one day when the Big Man upstairs, the LORD, was talking to Moses in, like, Egypt land, 29. So, like, God totally spoke to Moses and was all like, 'Yo, I'm the LORD, dude!' And He told Moses to go talk to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and spill all the tea about everything I'm telling you, like, no holding back, man. 30. So, Moses was like, 'Yo, God, you see, my way of speaking isn't the greatest, like I ain't got that smooth tongue. How can I expect Pharaoh to listen to me then? Like, it's gonna be tough, you know?'} \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 61. Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land. 2. And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I {am} the LORD: {the LORD: or, JEHOVAH} 3. And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by {the name of} God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. 4. And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. 5. And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. 6. Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I {am} the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments: 7. And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 8. And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I {am} the LORD. {swear: Heb. lift up my hand} 9. And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. {anguish: Heb. shortness, or, straitness} 10. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 11. Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 12. And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who {am} of uncircumcised lips? 13. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. 14. These {be} the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these {be} the families of Reuben. 15. And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these {are} the families of Simeon. 16. And these {are} the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi {were} an hundred thirty and seven years. 17. The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families. 18. And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath {were} an hundred thirty and three years. 19. And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these {are} the families of Levi according to their generations. 20. And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram {were} an hundred and thirty and seven years. 21. And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 22. And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. 23.

These {are} that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. 27. These {are} they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these {are} that Moses and Aaron. 28. And it came to pass on the day {when} the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt, 29. That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I {am} the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. 30. And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I {am} of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me? \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 71. Yo, Moses, listen up! Check it out, I'm about to elevate your status in Pharaoh's eyes. You'll be like a legit god to him, and your bro, Aaron, will be your hype man, spreading your divine message. 2. You gotta say everything that I tell you: and Aaron, your bro, will talk to Pharaoh, and be like, 'Yo, let the peeps of Israel bounce from your land.' 3. And I'll make Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and crank up the number of epic miracles and mind-blowing tricks I'll perform in Egypt. 4. But Pharaoh ain't gonna listen to you, so I can flex my power over Egypt and rescue my squad, the Israelites, outta Egypt with some epic judgments. 5. And like, the Egyptians are gonna be woke AF and realize that I, God, am the absolute boss when I flex on Egypt and free the Israelite fam from their grip. 6. So Moses and Aaron totally followed what the LORD told them to do, no questions asked. They were all about that divine obedience, and they nailed it! 7. So like, Moses was, like, 80 years old, and Aaron was, like, 83 years old, when they talked to Pharaoh. 8. So, like, God starts talking to Moses and Aaron, right? He's all like, 9. So, like, when Pharaoh comes up to you and is all like, 'Yo, show me a sick trick', you gotta be like, Aaronn, bro, grab your rod and throw it down in front of Pharaoh'. And bam! It'll turn into a full-on snake, dude. 10. So, Moses and Aaron straight up walked into Pharaoh's crib and they totally did what the LORD had ordered: Aaron straight up dropped his staff in front of Pharaoh and his squad, and boom! It turned into a freaking snake. 11. So Pharaoh was like, 'I need some extra brain power!' and he called in the wise guys and the sorcery squad - those Egyptian magicians who were all about their enchantments. And guess what? They totally did the same tricks, like, no big deal. 12. So, like, everyone threw down their rods and they became snakes. But Aaron's rod, you know, totally swallowed up their rods. 13. And God made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, so he didn't listen to them, just like God said. 14. Yo, the LORD was like, Mosess, listen up! Pharaoh's heart is straight up rock solid, dude's straight up refusing to let the people bounce.' 15. Go to Pharaoh in the morning, he's heading to the water. Stand by the river's edge until he arrives, and don't forget to bring the rod that turned into a serpent in your hand. 16. Yo, tell him this: the LORD God of the Hebrews hit me up and sent me to you, saying, let my peeps bounce so they can worship me in the wild. But dude, you ain't been listenin' so far. 17. Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD says: I'm about to show you that I'm the real deal. Check it, I'm gonna smack the waters in the river with my rod and bam! They're gonna turn into blood. 18. And like, all the fish in the river are gonna die and the whole river is gonna smell SO bad! The Egyptians are gonna be super grossed out and totally not wanna drink the water anymore. 19. And God talked to Moses and said, 'Yo Aaron, grab your rod and wave your hand over all the water in Egypt - the streams, the rivers, the ponds, even the pools - and turn it all into blood. Let blood flow across the whole land of Egypt, even in wooden and stone containers.' 20. So Moses and Aaron did what the LORD said, and Moses raised his staff and struck the water in the river. Everyone, including Pharaoh and his peeps, saw how the river turned into blood. 21. So, like, all the fish in the river died, and it turned super nasty and stinky, and the Egyptians couldn't even drink the water from the river. And to top it off, the whole land of Egypt was covered in blood, man. 22. The sorcerers of Egypt also did it with their totally magical moves, but Pharaoh's heart stayed stubborn and he didn't even pay them any attention, just like the LORD predicted. 23. Then Pharaoh dipped and bounced to his crib, and he didn't even bother with this. 24. So, like, all the Egyptians were totally digging around the river looking for drinkable water because they couldn't even drink the water that was in the river. 25. And after a whole week, once the LORD hit that river, it was a wrap. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 71. And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 2. Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. 3. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 4. But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, {and} my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 5. And the Egyptians shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. 6. And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they. 7. And Moses {was} fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh. 8. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 9. When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast {it} before Pharaoh, {and} it shall become a serpent. 10. And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 11. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 12. For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 13. And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 14. And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart {is} hardened, he refuseth to let the people go. 15. Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. 16. And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. 17. Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I {am} the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that {is} in mine hand upon the waters which {are} in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. 18. And the fish that {is} in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. 19. And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and {that} there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in {vessels of} wood, and in {vessels of} stone. {pools...: Heb. gathering of their waters} 20. And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that {were} in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that {were} in the river were turned to blood. 21. And the fish that {was} in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 22. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said. 23. And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also. 24. And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 25. And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 81. So, like, God was talking to Moses, and He told him to go talk to Pharaoh. And He was like, 'Tell Pharaoh this message from Me: Let my people go, so they can worship Me.' 2. And, like, if you're not down to let my peeps go, get ready for a serious frog invasion happening all over your territory, man: 3. And the river's gonna be flooded with frogs, like, there's gonna be a ton of 'em. They're gonna be all up in your house, in your room, even on your bed. They'll be in your servants' houses too, and all over your people. They'll even find their way into your kitchen and your baking equipment, like ovens and dough mixers. Yeah, it's gonna be wild. 4. And like, there will be frogs, everywhere... like, on you, your peeps, and all your squad. 5. So, God told Moses, like, go tell Aaron to, like, stretch out his hand with his staff or whatever over the streams, rivers, and ponds, and make frogs appear all over Egypt. 6. So Aaron totally flexed and put his hand over the waters in Egypt. And then boom! Frogs started popping up everywhere, and they took over the whole land of Egypt. 7. And the magicians used their magic tricks and conjured up a bunch of frogs all over Egypt. 8. So, Pharaoh hit up Moses and Aaron and was like, 'Yo, can you ask the LORD to get rid of these annoying frogs? They're buggin' me and my crew. And if you make it happen, I’m down to let the people bounce and do their sacrifice thing for the LORD.' 9. Yo, Pharaoh, listen up. When do you want me to ask the big guy upstairs to do something about these frogs infesting your crib and your peeps'? I mean, can we at least keep 'em in the river? It's all up to you, man. Just say the word and I'll make it happen. 10. And he was like, 'Yeah, tomorrow.' And he was like, 'Okay, cool. Let it happen just like you said, so you know that there's no one else as awesome as the LORD our God.' 11. And the frogs will peace out from you, your cribz, your squad, and your homies; they'll just chill in the river, y'know. 12. So Moses and Aaron bounced outta Pharaoh's crib, and Moses straight up hit up the big man upstairs 'cause of those mad annoying frogs he unleashed on Pharaoh. 13. So, like, God totally did what Moses said, and the frogs all died out of people's houses, the towns, and the fields. 14. And they piled them up in big stacks: and the whole place smelled awful. 15. But when Pharaoh realized he had a break, he stubbornly refused to listen to them, just like the LORD said. 16. Yo, the Big Guy upstairs told Moses to tell Aaron to flex his rod and smack the dust of the land. That way, it's gonna turn into lice all over Egypt. 17. So Aaron did his thing, he raised his hand with his rod and BAM, he smacked the earth's dust and it turned into a swarm of lice. Not just on people, but on animals too! The whole land was infested with lice, from one end to the other throughout Egypt. 18. So the magicians tried their tricks to summon lice, but totally failed: the result? People and animals were both infested with lice. 19. So like, the magicians were all like, 'Yo Pharaoh, this is totally God flexing His power', but Pharaoh was like, so stubborn and didn't even listen to them, just like how the LORD said it would be. 20. And God was like, 'Yo, Moses, wake up early in the morning and go stand in front of Pharaoh. Dude's heading to the water and here's what you gotta say to him: God says, 'Let my people go, so they can worship me.' 21. Yo, if you don't free my peeps, brace yourself 'cause I'm about to unleash hella flies on you, your crew, your whole squad, and even up in your crib. The Egyptians gonna have their houses straight up infested with flies, and even the ground gonna be crawling with 'em. 22. And like, on that day, I'm gonna make this place called Goshen where my peeps live totally fly-free, just so you'll know I'm the Lord and I'm in charge of everything. Solid, right in the middle of the earth. 23. Yo, I'm gonna separate my peeps from your peeps: this lit sign will show up tomorrow. 💥 24. And God made it happen; a bunch of annoying flies invaded Pharaoh's house, his servants' houses, and the entire land of Egypt. The land was messed up because of all those pesky flies buzzing around everywhere. 25. So Pharaoh hit up Moses and Aaron like, 'Ay, go do your sacrifice thing for your God right here in Egypt, you know?' 26. And Moses was like, nah we can't do that, you feel me? We can't offer up the disgusting things that the Egyptians worship to the LORD our God. Like, imagine if we did that in front of them, they'd totally come at us with stones, no cap. 27. We're gonna trek through the wilderness for like three days and offer a sacrifice to the LORD our God, just like He tells us to do. 28. So Pharaoh was like, 'Okay, I'll let you guys bounce and do your worship thing in the wilderness, but don't go too far, and hey, put in a good word for me, alright? Keep me in your prayers, fam.' 29. So Moses was like, 'Yo, I'm about to dip and talk to the big man upstairs. Gonna ask the LORD to make those pesky fly swarms buzz off from Pharaoh, his peeps, and his squad by tomorrow. But Pharaoh better stop playin' games and not keep holding back the peeps from going to do their worship thing for the LORD.' 30. So Moses bounced out of Pharaoh's crib and straight up pleaded with the LORD. 31. So, like, God totally did what Moses said and, like, got rid of all those annoying flies from Pharaoh, his peeps, and even his servants. Seriously, not a single fly was left. 32. And Pharaoh was like, totally stubborn once again, refusing to set the people free. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 81. And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 2. And if thou refuse to let {them} go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: 3. And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs: {kneadingtroughs: or, dough} 4. And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. 5. And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. 6. And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 7. And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. 8. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. 9. And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, {that} they may remain in the river only? {Glory...: or, Have this honour over me, etc} {when: or, against when} {to destroy: Heb. to cut off} 10. And he said, To morrow. And he said, {Be it} according to thy word: that thou mayest know that {there is} none like unto the LORD our God. {To morrow: or, Against to morrow} 11. And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. 12. And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. 13. And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. 14. And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank. 15. But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 16. And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 17. And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 18. And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. 19. Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This {is} the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said. 20. And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 21. Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms {of flies} upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms {of flies}, and also the ground whereon they {are}. {swarms...: or, a mixture of noisome beasts, etc} 22. And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms {of flies} shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I {am} the LORD in the midst of the earth. 23. And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be. {a division: Heb. a redemption} {to morrow: or, by to morrow} 24. And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm {of flies} into the house of Pharaoh, and {into} his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm {of flies}. {corrupted: or, destroyed} 25. And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. 26. And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? 27. We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us. 28. And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me. 29. And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms {of flies} may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. 30. And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 31. And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms {of flies} from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. 32. And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 91. Yo, Moses, listen up. God is telling you to slide into Pharaoh's DMs and hit him with this message: Godd, the ultimate squad leader of the Hebrews, wants his peeps to be free from bondage so they can flex their worship game for him.' 2. Like, if you're gonna keep refusing to let {them} go and just cling onto them,  3. Yo, check it out! The Lord's power is gonna affect all your animals out in the field like cows, horses, donkeys, camels, oxen, and sheep. It's gonna be a seriously bad disease, dudes. 4. Yo, the LORD's gonna straight up separate the animals of Israel from those of Egypt, and none of the children of Israel's animals will die or anything. No worries, fam. 5. And God was like, 'Yo, listen up! Tomorrow I'm gonna make some epic moves happen in this place, you feel me? 6. And the LORD did that thing the next day, and all the cows in Egypt died: but not a single cow belonging to the children of Israel died. 7. So Pharaoh hit 'em up and guess what? None of the Israelites' cows were dead. But Pharaoh's heart stayed stubborn, and he still refused to let the people bounce. 8. So, God was like, 'Hey Moses and Aaron, grab some ashes from the furnace and have Moses sprinkle it toward the sky in front of Pharaoh.' 9. And like, Egypt is gonna be covered in this super tiny dust that's gonna cause like these nasty boils and blisters to appear on people and animals all over the place, throughout the whole land of Egypt. 10. They grabbed some ashes from the furnace and stood in front of Pharaoh. Then Moses sprinkled it up towards the sky, and boom, everything started breaking out in gnarly boils on people and animals alike. 11. So, like, the magicians couldn't even handle Moses, man! They were totally covered in gross boils, just like all the other Egyptians. 12. So, like, God totally made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he, like, didn't listen to Moses and them, just as God said, you know? 13. So like, God was straight up talking to Moses and was all like, 'Dude, wake up early in the morning and go stand in front of Pharaoh. Then say to him, 'Yo, this is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, is saying: Let my people bounce so they can worship me.' 14. Because I'm about to unleash all my epic disasters on you, your crew, and your peeps. Just so you realize that there's no one cooler than me in the entire world. 15. Yo, I'm about to flex and bring down some serious fire! Gonna hit you and your squad with sick plagues, and you'll be wiped off the face of the earth. 16. And for real, I deliberately brought you into existence to flex my strength through you and make sure everyone knows my name all over the world. (Btw, when it says 'raised', it means like, 'made you stand'.) 17. Why are you still acting all high and mighty, refusing to let my people go? 18. Yo, listen up! Tomorrow, at this exact time, I'm gonna make it rain super intense hail, like nothing Egypt has ever seen before, not even since the beginning! 19. So, like, go and gather all your animals and stuff that you have in the field. If you don't bring them home, then hail will come down on them and they'll, like, die and stuff. 20. The dude who respected the word of the LORD, like, totally made his servants and his animals bounce into the houses, man: 21. And anyone who didn't pay attention to what the LORD said, well, they just left their peeps and their animals out in the field. #oops #shouldhavebeenlistening 22. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, raise your hand up to the sky so there can be massive hail all over Egypt. It's gonna hit people, animals, and every single plant in the whole land, bro.' 23. So Moses like, straight up lifted his staff towards the sky, and then BOOM, the LORD sent some major thunder and hail, with fire blazing on the ground too. And yep, the LORD made it rain hail like crazy all over Egypt. 24. It was wild, guys! There was this crazy storm with hail and fire mixed in, like the gnarliest combo ever. Seriously, nothing like it had ever happened in Egypt before. Absolute madness, man! 25. So like, this super intense hailstorm hit Egypt and wrecked everything in sight - plants, trees, and even people and animals out in the open. It was really wild, man. 26. In the Goshen region, where the Israelite fam were, there wasn't any mad hailstorm goin' on. 27. So Pharaoh hit them up, and was like, 'Yo, Moses and Aaron, I messed up big time. The big man upstairs is totally in the right, and me and my crew are wicked, no cap.' 28. Yo, like, ask the Lord (cuz seriously, it's getting old) to stop with all the booming thunder and hailstorms, and I'll give you the green light to bounce. No more delays, I promise. (Those thunder... things were intense, man!) 29. Yo, Moses told him, once I dip out of the city, I'm gonna raise my hands up to the LORD and you'll see, the thunder will chill and there won't be any more hail. This is gonna prove to you that the earth belongs to the LORD. 30. But, like, I totally know that you and your squad aren't gonna be showing any respect to the LORD God just yet. 31. And like, dude, the flax and the barley got totally messed up, bro. 'Cause the barley was in that stage where it's all sprouted and the flax was flowering, man. 32. But the wheat and the rye were totally unharmed because they hadn't fully grown yet. They were still hidden, like in the dark. 33. So Moses left the city and approached the LORD, raising his hands up high. And then, like, the crazy thunderstorms and hail stopped, and no more rain fell on the ground. 34. And when Pharaoh peeped that the rain and the hail and the mega loud thunders were done, he like, totally sinned even harder, and straight up toughened his heart, along with his whole crew. 35. But like, Pharaoh's heart was all stubborn and stuff, and he was like, 'No way, I'm not letting the Israelite kids go!' Just as the LORD had said through Moses, you know? \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 91. Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 2. For if thou refuse to let {them} go, and wilt hold them still, 3. Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which {is} in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: {there shall be} a very grievous murrain. 4. And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all {that is} the children's of Israel. 5. And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land. 6. And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. 7. And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. 8. And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. 9. And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth {with} blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. 10. And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth {with} blains upon man, and upon beast. 11. And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 12. And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses. 13. And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 14. For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that {there is} none like me in all the earth. 15. For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. 16. And in very deed for this {cause} have I raised thee up, for to shew {in} thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. {raised...: Heb. made thee stand} 17. As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? 18. Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now. 19. Send therefore now, {and} gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; {for upon} every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. 20. He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 21. And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field. {regarded...: Heb. set not his heart unto} 22. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. 23. And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. 24. So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 25. And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that {was} in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field. 26. Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel {were}, was there no hail. 27. And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD {is} righteous, and I and my people {are} wicked. 28. Intreat the LORD (for {it is} enough) that there be no {more} mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. {mighty...: Heb. voices of God} 29. And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; {and} the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth {is} the LORD'S. 30. But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. 31. And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley {was} in the ear, and the flax {was} bolled. 32. But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they {were} not grown up. {not grown...: Heb. hidden or, dark} 33. And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. 34. And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 35. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses. {by Moses: Heb. by the hand of Moses} \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 101. And God was like, yo Moses, go talk to Pharaoh, 'cause I made him and his squad stubborn on purpose, so I can flex my miracles in front of him, you know? 2. So you can pass on the story to your kid and your grandkid and let them know all the epic stuff I did in Egypt, the mind-blowing miracles I performed. It's all to show you that I'm the ultimate boss, the LORD. 3. So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and told him, like, the LORD God of the Hebrews is like, 'Dude, how much longer are you gonna keep being all stubborn and not show some respect? Just let my people go, so they can do their thing and serve me, ya feel? 4. Yo, if you keep frontin' and won't let my squad bounce, check it, tomorrow I'm unleashing swarms of locusts straight to your turf. 5. So basically, they're gonna be all over the place, like you won't even be able to see the ground. And they'll chow down on whatever's left after the crazy hailstorm, including all the trees in your fields. (FYI, 'face' in Hebrew means 'eye') 6. And they'll totally pack your crib, and your servants' cribs, and all the cribs in Egypt, mate. Like, this is legit stuff that not even your oldies or their oldies have ever witnessed, from back in the day till now. And then he bailed on Pharaoh, just like that. 7. Pharaoh's squad was like, yo, how much longer we gonna let this dude mess with us? Let the homies bounce and do their thing for the LORD their God. Don't you realize that Egypt is already wrecked? 8. So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he told them, 'Okay, go and worship the LORD your God. But tell me, who exactly is going? Like, who's in the squad?' 9. So Moses was like, 'Yo, everyone's coming on this trip. Young, old, sons, daughters, flocks, herds - we're all going! Gotta throw a lit feast for the LORD.' 10. And he was like, 'May the LORD be with you all, just as I'll let you and your little ones go. Be careful though, because danger is right in front of you.' 11. Nah, it's all good. You guys should just bounce and do your thing for the LORD, like you wanted to. Then Pharaoh straight up kicked them out of his crib. 12. So God said to Moses, yo dude, reach out your hand over Egypt, 'cause we 'bout to bring some locusts up in here. They gonna munch on all the plants that got left by the hail, no chill. 13. So Moses whipped out his staff and held it up in Egypt, and the LORD brought a sick east wind that lasted the entire day and night. And when morning came, the east wind brought in a swarm of locusts! 14. And so, like, these locusts straight up covered all of Egypt and like, they chilled out all over the place, man. It was, like, super intense; there had never been locusts like that before, and there won't be any like them ever again. 15. Like, they totally covered the whole earth and it got super dark because they ate up all the plants and fruits that were left after the hailstorm. Literally no green stuff was left on the trees or in the fields throughout the entire land of Egypt. 16. So Pharaoh was like, 'Yo Moses and Aaron, come here ASAP!' And he was like, 'Guys, I totally messed up big time. I sinned against the LORD your God and against you.' 17. So, like, I really messed up this one time, but can you, like, ask God to forgive me and just, like, remove this punishment of death? 18. So he bounced outta Pharaoh's presence and straight-up pleaded with the LORD. 19. Then God totally unleashed a sick strong west wind that straight up yeeted the locusts and chucked them into the Red Sea, leaving zero locusts anywhere in Egypt. Not a single one, fam! 20. But like, God totally made Pharaoh's heart super stubborn, so he wouldn't even let the Israelite squad bounce. 21. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, raise your hand towards the sky so that darkness can cover all of Egypt. And it's gonna be, like, super intense darkness, you can legit feel it, you know? Like, it's gonna be next level darkness.' 22. So Moses, like, raised his hand to the sky, and then like, a super intense darkness covered the whole land of Egypt for three whole days, man: 23. They didn't even see each other, or leave their spots for three whole days. But all the peeps of Israel had mad light in their cribz. 24. So Pharaoh hit up Moses and was like, 'Yo, go do your thing and worship the LORD, but keep your animals in check and don't forget to bring your little ones with you.' 25. Moses was like, yo, we need some sacrifices and burnt offerings so we can worship the LORD our God. It's essential, you know? Like, hook us up with that. {us: Heb. into our hands} 26. Our cows are coming along too, none of them are staying behind, 'cause we gotta bring 'em to serve the Lord our God. And we have no clue what else we're gonna need to serve the Lord until we get there. 27. But God, like, totally made Pharaoh's heart super stubborn, so he straight up refused to let the people go. 28. Pharaoh was like, 'Yo, get outta my sight and don't ever come back! If you show your face around here again, you're gonna be toast.' 29. And Moses was like, 'Yo, you got some good points there. I'm outta here, won't be seeing your face again'. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 101. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him: 2. And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I {am} the LORD. 3. And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. 4. Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast: 5. And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: {face: Heb. eye} 6. And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. 7. And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? 8. And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: {but} who {are} they that shall go? {who...: Heb. who and who, etc} 9. And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we {must hold} a feast unto the LORD. 10. And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look {to it}; for evil {is} before you. 11. Not so: go now ye {that are} men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. 12. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, {even} all that the hail hath left. 13. And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all {that} night; {and} when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 14. And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous {were they}; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. 15. For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. 16. Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. {called: Heb. hastened to call} 17. Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only. 18. And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 19. And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt. {cast: Heb. fastened} 20. But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go. 21. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness {which} may be felt. {even...: Heb. that one may feel darkness} 22. And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 23. They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. 24. And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you. 25. And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. {us: Heb. into our hands} 26. Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. 27. But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. 28. And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in {that} day thou seest my face thou shalt die. 29.

      "Gen Z: Exodus 111. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, I got one more big bad thing coming for Pharaoh and Egypt. After that, he's definitely gonna let you all bounce. And when he finally lets y'all go, he's gonna straight up kick y'all out for real.' 2. Yo, listen up fam! Go tell everyone to ask their homies for some bling, both the guys and the girls, like silver and gold jewelry. 3. God made the Egyptians really like the Israelites. And Moses was super popular in Egypt, everyone loved him, even the Pharaoh's servants and the regular people. 4. Yo, Moses was like, listen up peeps! The LORD has spoken and he's like, around midnight, I'm gonna make a grand exit right in the heart of Egypt, you know? 5. Yo, listen up! In Egypt, all the oldest peeps, from the main homie Pharaoh's firstborn to the firstborn of even the lowest servants, gonna pass away. And don't forget, even the firstborn animals ain't spared. 6. And there's gonna be, like, a huge cry all over Egypt, like, totally unprecedented, never gonna happen again. 7. But no dog will even bark at any of the Israelites, whether they are human or animal. This is so you'll understand that the LORD sets the Egyptians and Israelites apart from each other. 8. And all your homies will come to me and show me respect, saying, Peacee out, take all your followers with you.' And then I'll bounce. And he left Pharaoh, mad as hell. 9. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, just so you know, Pharaoh ain't gonna listen to you. I'm just tryna flex my mad miracles all over Egypt'. 10. So like, Moses and Aaron totally pulled off all these mind-blowing miracles right in front of Pharaoh.

And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses {was} very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. 4. And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: 5. And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that {is} behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts. 6. And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. 7. But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. 8. And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. {that follow...: Heb. that is at thy feet} {a great...: Heb. heat of anger} 9. And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 10. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 121. So, like, God straight up starts talking to Moses and Aaron while they're still in Egypt, and this is what He said: 2. Yo fam, this month is gonna be the start of all months, like the OG month of the year, you know what I'm sayin'? 3. Yo, tell all the Israel peeps this: On the tenth day of this month, each bro gotta snatch a lamb for his crib, depending on his fam lineage. One lamb per fam, ya dig? (Lamb can also mean a kid, FYI) 4. If there aren't enough people in the house to finish off the lamb, let the guy and his next door friend team up and split it based on everyone's appetite. Each person should eat their fair share of the lamb. 5. Make sure your lamb is absolutely flawless, a young male that's only a year old. Whether from the sheep or the goats, take it out for the sacrifice. 6. And you gotta keep it going until the fourteenth day of that same month: and the whole squad of Israel peeps gonna slay it in the evening. {in...: Heb. between the two evenings} 7. And they gotta take some of the blood and smack it on the two side posts and on top of the door frame of the houses, where they gonna chow down. 8. And they gotta chow down on that meat, cooked up with some fire, and have it with some unleavened bread; and don't forget the bitter herbs, they gotta eat it all together. 9. Don't eat it raw or boiled with water, but grill it up! Cook the whole thing - head, legs, and all the guts. 10. And don't leave anything behind until morning; whatever's left, you gotta burn it up with fire before morning hits. 11. So, like, here's how you should eat it: be ready to go, with your jeans on and your favorite kicks, and hold your phone in one hand ready to leave quickly, okay? Don't waste time, it's the LORD'S passover vibes. 12. Yo, tonight I'm gonna roll through Egypt and teach them a lesson. I'm gonna take out all the firstborn, no matter if they're human or animal. And guess what? I'm not just gonna mess with the people, but I'm also gonna show those Egyptian gods who's boss. It's time for some serious judgment, and let me tell you, I'm the LORD, so I call the shots. (Or should I say, the princes?) 13. And the blood will be like a signal on the houses where you {are}: and when I see the blood, I'll skip over you, and the plague won't come to wreck you when I strike Egypt. {to destroy...: Heb. for a destruction} 14. So, like, this day is gonna be super memorable and you gotta celebrate it as a lit feast for the LORD throughout all your future generations. It's gonna be a never-ending celebration, like an epic tradition that never goes out of style. 15. Yo, for a whole week, y'all better be chowing down on that flatbread, no yeast allowed! Just make sure to ditch any leavening in your crib on day one. 'Cause if anyone dares to munch on that leavened bread from day one all the way 'til day seven, they gonna be straight up exiled from the Israel fam. 16. On the first day, there's gonna be a super chill gathering, and on the seventh day, there's gonna be another super chill gathering for you. You gotta take a break from work on those days, except for getting your grub on, that's totally cool and necessary. (btw, mann' means soull' in Hebrew) 17. And you gotta celebrate the unleavened bread feast, 'cause on this exact day, I saved your crew from Egypt. So, make sure y'all keep on celebrating this day for all future generations, 'cause it's gonna be a forever tradition. 18. On the first {month}, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, you gotta chow down on some unleavened bread till the twenty-first day of the month in the evening. 19. For a whole week, you gotta make sure there's no leaven in your crib. 'Cause anyone who eats leavened stuff gonna be straight-up banned from the Israel fam, whether they're new in town or OG native. 20. Don't chow down on anything leavened! Only munch on that unleavened bread, no matter where you're at. 21. So Moses gathered all the OGs of Israel and was like, yo, get a lamb or a kid if you prefer, for each of your fams, and go slay that passover sacrifice. 22. And you gotta grab some hyssop and dip it in the blood in the bowl, then go ahead and sprinkle the blood on the doorway and the side posts. And nobody can leave their crib until the next morning. 23. Yo, the LORD gonna straight up come through and wreck those Egyptians. But when He peeps the blood on the doorframe and the two side panels, He gonna pass right over that door, not letting the destroyer come in to wreck your houses and mess with y'all. 24. And you gotta keep doing this thing, like, forever, both for yourself and for your future kids, okay? 25. And, like, when you finally reach the land that the LORD is hooking you up with, just as he promised, you gotta keep doing this whole service thing, ya know? 26. So, like, one day when your kids are all like, 'Yo, what's the deal with this whole service thing?' 27. So you gotta be like, 'Yo, this is the lit sacrifice for the LORD'S passover, when He flexed and passed over the houses of the fam Israel in Egypt. He straight up clapped the Egyptians and saved our crib. And the whole fam showed respect and worshiped. 28. So, like, the Israelites bounced and totally followed the instructions from the LORD that Moses and Aaron had passed on to them. They were totally obedient, no doubt! 29. So, like, this totally happened, bro: In the middle of the night, the LORD totally went all supernatural and struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt. Yeah, from the super important firstborn son of Pharaoh all the way down to the firstborn prisoner stuck in the dungeon, and even the firstborn animals got affected, man. (BTW, dungeon means like, house of the pit in case you didn't know) 30. Then Pharaoh and all his peeps, along with everyone in Egypt, panicked real hard in the middle of the night. It was a total freakout, yo! There wasn't a single crib in the whole place where someone didn't end up biting the dust. 31. So, like, God summonsed Moses and Aaron in the middle of the night and was all like, 'Yo, get up and get outta here with the people of Israel. Go serve the LORD, just like you said you would.' 32. Yo, grab your homies and all your animals like you said, dip out of here, and show some love by blessing me too. 33. The Egyptians were totally pressuring everyone to leave the land ASAP because they thought we were all gonna kick the bucket. 34. So, like, the people snagged their dough before it had time to rise, and they wrapped up their kneading tools in their clothes and carried them on their shoulders. You know, just sayin', 'kneadingtroughs' is another word for dough, if you catch my drift. 35. So, like, the Israelites totally listened to Moses, right? And they just straight up asked the Egyptians for all their fancy bling - you know, silver and gold jewels, and even some stylish clothes! 36. And the Lord made the Egyptians think the Israelites were pretty cool, so the Egyptians totally hooked them up with whatever they needed. And guess what? The Israelites ended up taking a bunch of stuff from the Egyptians. 37. And the fam of Israel bounced from Rameses to Succoth, with like 600k dudes on foot, not counting the kiddos. 38. And, like, a bunch of different people went with them, and they brought along a ton of animals, like, a ridiculous amount of cows and stuff. 39. So, they made some plain cakes from the dough they brought from Egypt. They didn't add any yeast because they had to hurry and leave Egypt, and they didn't have time to prepare any proper food. 40. So, like, the Israelite squad, right, they were chillin' in Egypt for a solid four hundred and thirty years. 41. And after waiting for a long, long time, exactly four hundred and thirty years to be precise, it finally happened! On that very day, all the squads of the LORD dipped out of Egypt like peace out, homies! 42. Yo, this is a lit night to remember for the LORD 'cause He brought the Israelites outta Egypt. Like, it's THE night for all future generations of the children of Israel to celebrate and remember. #NightOfObservation 43. And God was like, yo Moses and Aaron, this is the rule for Passover: No random person can grub on that feast: 44. But, like, if you purchase a servant with cash, ya know, and then you, like, go and circumcise him, well, then he can, uh, totally have a bite of it. 45. Don't let any outsiders or hired help chow down on it, okay? 46. You gotta chow down on that food all in one crib, don't take any of that meat outside the house, and make sure you keep those bones intact, no flexin'. 47. Everybody in the Israel crew gotta keep it. {keep...: Like, actually do it} 48. If someone new comes to chill with you and wants to celebrate Passover, make sure all the dudes get circumcised first, then they can join in. Treat them like they're one of the homies from the land, because only the circumcised ones can feast on it. 49. Everyone, whether they're a local or visitor, abides by the same rules. 50. And all the Israelite fam did exactly as the LORD told Moses and Aaron, no questions asked. 51. And on that very day, the LORD led the cool peeps of Israel out of Egypt with their squads. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 121. And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, 2. This month {shall be} unto you the beginning of months: it {shall be} the first month of the year to you. 3. Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth {day} of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of {their} fathers, a lamb for an house: {lamb: or, kid} 4. And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take {it} according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. 5. Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take {it} out from the sheep, or from the goats: {of...: Heb. son of a year} 6. And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. {in...: Heb. between the two evenings} 7. And they shall take of the blood, and strike {it} on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. 8. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; {and} with bitter {herbs} they shall eat it. 9. Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast {with} fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. 10. And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. 11. And thus shall ye eat it; {with} your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it {is} the LORD'S passover. 12. For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I {am} the LORD. {gods: or, princes} 13. And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye {are}: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy {you}, when I smite the land of Egypt. {to destroy...: Heb. for a destruction} 14. And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. 15. Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 16. And in the first day {there shall be} an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save {that} which every man must eat, that only may be done of you. {man: Heb. soul} 17. And ye shall observe {the feast of} unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. 18. In the first {month}, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even. 19. Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land. 20. Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. 21. Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. {lamb: or, kid} 22. And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip {it} in the blood that {is} in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that {is} in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning. 23. For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite {you}. 24. And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. 25. And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. 26. And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? 27. That ye shall say, It {is} the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped. 28. And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 29. And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that {was} in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle. {dungeon: Heb. house of the pit} 30. And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for {there was} not a house where {there was} not one dead. 31. And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, {and} get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. 32. Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also. 33. And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We {be} all dead {men}. 34. And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. {kneadingtroughs: or, dough} 35. And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: 36. And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them {such things as they required}. And they spoiled the Egyptians. 37. And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot {that were} men, beside children. 38. And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, {even} very much cattle. {a mixed...: Heb. a great mixture} 39. And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual. 40. Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, {was} four hundred and thirty years. 41. And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt. 42. It {is} a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this {is} that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations. {a night...: Heb. a night of observations} 43. And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This {is} the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 44. But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. 45. A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. 46. In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 47. All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. {keep...: Heb. do it} 48. And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof. 49. One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you. 50. Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. 51. And it came to pass the selfsame day, {that} the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 131. And God spoke to Moses, like, dude, listen up, 2. Yo, set apart for me all the firstborn, no matter if they be human or animal, from the children of Israel. They belong to me, straight up. 3. Yo, listen up fam! Moses was like, yo peeps, never forget this day when we totally bounced outta Egypt, straight outta enslavement! Like, the Lord totally flexed his power and saved us from that {place}, so we gotta ditch the leavened bread. No more of that, aight? {bondage: Hebrew for servants, FYI} 4. Yo fam, today is the day you dipped out in the month called Abib. 5. And when the LORD takes you to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites, just like he promised your ancestors, a place that's all abundant and awesome, make sure you celebrate this occasion every year. 6. For a whole week, you gotta stick to unleavened bread, and on the seventh day, it's time to throw down and celebrate for the LORD. 7. You gotta eat that unleavened bread for a whole week, and don't even think about having any leavened bread around. No leaven allowed anywhere in your crib. 8. And on that day, you gotta tell your kid like, 'Yo, this happened 'cause the LORD straight up saved me when I peaced out of Egypt.' 9. And this is gonna be like a cool accessory on your hand, and like a dope reminder right between your eyes, so that you always keep God's law on your lips, 'cause you know, the Lord totally flexed and rescued you from Egypt with some serious power moves. 10. So make sure to keep following this tradition every year at the right time. 11. And when the LORD takes you to the Canaanites' land, just like he promised to you and your ancestors, and gives it to you, 12. You gotta dedicate anything that's the firstborn or opens the womb to the LORD, whether it's a person or an animal. The dudes belong to the LORD. 13. So, like, if your firstborn donkey happens, you know, you gotta trade it for a lamb. And if you're not down with that, then you gotta break its neck, bro. Oh, and by the way, any firstborn human in your fam, you gotta redeem them too. Just a heads up, you can also replace 'lamb' with 'kid' if you're into that. 14. And when your kid asks you in the future like, 'Yo, what's up with this?' you gotta tell them, 'Yo, the LORD straight up flexed His power and got us outta Egypt, where we were all trapped, you feel? Like, that's how it went down, fam. Tomorrow is another day, just so you know.' 15. So, like, when Pharaoh was being super stubborn about letting us leave, the LORD went ahead and took out all the firstborn in Egypt, both peeps and animals. That's why I make sacrifices to the LORD with all the male animals that are born first. But when it comes to my own kids, I redeem them instead. 16. And wear it as a symbol on your hand and between your eyebrows, to always remember that the Lord rescued us from Egypt through His awesome power. 17. So, like, when Pharaoh finally let the peeps go, God didn't lead them through the land of the Philistines, even though it was, like, closer and stuff. 'Cause God was like, 'Maybe if they see some war action, they'll freak out and want to go back to Egypt, you know?' 18. But God guided the peeps, like, on this wild journey through the wilderness by the Red Sea and the Israelites went all decked out, like, five in a row, as they left Egypt. You know, they were organized and ready to go. 19. So Moses grabbed Joseph's bones because he had made a serious promise to the Israelites. He said, 'Don't worry, God's got your back. And when you bounce from this place, make sure my bones come along too.' 20. Then they left Succoth and set up camp in Etham, right on the edge of the wilderness. 21. And God was there for them, guiding their path during the day with a rad cloud, and lighting up their nights with a lit fire, so they could travel both day and night. 22. He didn't get rid of the sick clouds during the day or the lit fires at night in front of the crowd. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 131. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, {both} of man and of beast: it {is} mine. 3. And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this {place}: there shall no leavened bread be eaten. {bondage: Heb. servants} 4. This day came ye out in the month Abib. 5. And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. 6. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day {shall be} a feast to the LORD. 7. Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters. 8. And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, {This is done} because of that {which} the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt. 9. And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. 10. Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year. 11. And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, 12. That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males {shall be} the LORD'S. {set...: Heb. cause to pass over} 13. And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. {lamb: or, kid} 14. And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What {is} this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: {in...: Heb. to morrow} 15. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem. 16. And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt. 17. And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not {through} the way of the land of the Philistines, although that {was} near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 18. But God led the people about, {through} the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt. {harnessed: or, by five in a rank} 19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you. 20. And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. 21. And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night: 22. He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, {from} before the people. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 141. Yo, God hit up Moses and was like, 2. Yo, tell the Israel fam to turn up and chill near Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baalzephon. They gotta camp right by the sea, no doubt. 3. Pharaoh gonna be like, 'Yo, those Israel kids stuck up in this place, the wildness got 'em trapped'. 4. I'm gonna make Pharaoh stubborn so he'll chase after them. And I'll show off my power to Pharaoh and his crew, just so the Egyptians can see that I'm the big boss. And, yup, that's exactly what happened. 5. So, like, word got to the king of Egypt that the people bounced, and Pharaoh and his squad got all mad and started hating on the people. They were like, 'Why did we let Israel go? What were we thinking?' 6. Then he got his whip and gathered his squad: 7. And he flexed with six hundred epic chariots, and snagged all the sick chariots of Egypt, with captains slaying the game on each one of them. 8. And God made Pharaoh king of Egypt stubborn, and he went after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel left confidently. 9. So, like, the Egyptians totally went after them, with all their horses and chariots and stuff, along with their horsemen and their whole army, and caught up with them at the sea, near this place called Pihahiroth, just before Baalzephon. 10. So Pharaoh came closer, and the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians marching behind them. They were really scared and started crying out to the LORD. 11. Yo, they were like, Mosess, seriously?! Were there not enough graves in Egypt? Did you really bring us out here in the wilderness just to die? Why you gotta do us like that and take us out of Egypt?' 12. Hey, remember when we told you back in Egypt to leave us alone so we could just serve the Egyptians? We thought it would be better to be their servants than to die out here in the wilderness. 13. And Moses was like, 'Hey, don't even trip, you guys! Just chill out and watch as the LORD saves us today. Like, seriously, you won't even see those Egyptians again, ever. It's gonna be lit!' 14. God's got your back, so chillax and let Him handle it. 15. God was like, yo Moses, why you crying out to me? Instead, talk to the Israelite squad and tell 'em to keep it moving: forward! 16. Okay, so here's the game plan: take your rod, flex it up and extend your hand over the sea, like you're about to drop a sick beat. Then watch the magic happen as the sea splits into two, creating a rad pathway for the kids of Israel to strut their stuff on dry ground, right through the middle of the sea. 17. So, get this, I'm gonna make the Egyptians' hearts super stubborn, and they're gonna chase after the Israelites. And here's the best part: I'm gonna totally flex on Pharaoh and his crew, including his sick chariots and epic horsemen. It's gonna be legendary! 18. And all those Egyptians will realize that I am the LORD, once I show my power over Pharaoh, his cool chariots, and his squad of horsemen. 19. So, like, this angel from God, who was leading the Israel peeps, bounced to the back and started following them. And you won't believe it, but the cloud thingy that was guiding them, it moved from in front of them and stood behind them. Crazy, right? 20. So this big cloud thing appeared between the Egyptian camp and the Israelite camp. It was all dark and spooky for the Egyptians, but for the Israelites, it actually lit up the night. This crazy cloud kept the Egyptians and Israelites separate all through the night, so there was no chance of them getting close to each other. 21. So Moses totally raised his hand and flexed it over the sea, and then the LORD was like, 'Yo, I got this!' He made this epic strong wind blow all night from the east, and guess what? It actually made the sea pull a reverse Uno card, transforming it into solid ground and splitting the waters in half. Talk about a total power move! 22. So, like, the Israelites totally walked through the sea on this, like, super dry ground! And get this - the water, it was like a wall on their right and left. How epic is that?! 23. So like, the Egyptians were totally chasing after them, and they even went into the sea with all of Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and horsemen. 24. Then, like, in the early morning, the LORD peeped on the Egyptian crew through the fire and cloud thingy, and totally wrecked them. 25. And they popped the wheels off their fancy chariots, causing them to move painfully slow. The Egyptians were like, 'Yo, let's bounce and run away from Israel because the Lord is totally backing them up, fighting against us.' 26. So, God said to Moses, yo dude, extend your hand over the sea and let the water come back, totally drenching those Egyptians, their fancy chariots, and those horse dudes. 27. So Moses straight-up extended his hand over the sea, and when morning arrived, the sea was like, 'I'm back, baby!' And the Egyptians were like, Peacee, I'm out!' But then the LORD straight-up wrecked the Egyptians right in the middle of the sea. {overthrew: Like, shook off} 28. Then the water came back and totally wrecked the chariots, and the horse guys, and all of Pharaoh's squad that followed them into the sea; not a single one of them made it out alive. 29. So, the Israelites straight up walked on dry ground through the middle of the sea, fam. The water was like a solid wall on their right and left, keeping them safe and sound. 30. So, like, God totally saved Israel from the Egyptians on that epic day, and when Israel looked, they saw those Egyptians lying dead on the beach by the sea. It was crazy! 31. And Israel saw how epic the LORD's moves were against the Egyptians. The people were shook and had mad respect for the LORD and straight up believed in the LORD and his homeboy Moses. #miraclehands \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 141. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. 3. For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They {are} entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. 4. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I {am} the LORD. And they did so. 5. And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 6. And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: 7. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 8. And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand. 9. But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses {and} chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon. 10. And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. 11. And they said unto Moses, Because {there were} no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? 12. {Is} not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For {it had been} better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. 13. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. {for the...: or, for whereas ye have seen the Egyptians to day} 14. The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. 15. And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 16. But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry {ground} through the midst of the sea. 17. And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 18. And the Egyptians shall know that I {am} the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 19. And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: 20. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness {to them}, but it gave light by night {to these}: so that the one came not near the other all the night. 21. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go {back} by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry {land}, and the waters were divided. 22. And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry {ground}: and the waters {were} a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 23. And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, {even} all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 24. And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, 25. And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. {that they...: or, and made them to go heavily} 26. And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. 27. And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. {overthrew: Heb. shook off} 28. And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, {and} all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. 29. But the children of Israel walked upon dry {land} in the midst of the sea; and the waters {were} a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 30. Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. 31. And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses. {work: Heb. hand} \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 151. So Moses and the squad of Israel straight up dropped this fire song for the LORD, and they were like, 'Yo, I'ma sing for the LORD 'cause He straight up smashed it! Like, He totally wiped out the horse and its rider straight into the sea!' 2. GOD is like, my ultimate power and jam, you know? He's, like, totally saved me and stuff. He's my homie, my ride or die, you feel me? And I'm gonna hook Him up with a sweet spot to chill. He's my OG, my numero uno, and I'm gonna give Him all the props. 3. Yo, the LORD is like a total warrior, man! His name is the LORD, no cap. 4. Yo, God straight up yeeted Pharaoh's whips and his whole crew into the sea. Even their top dogs got dunked in the Red sea. 5. They got totally covered and went straight to the depths, sinking like a stone to the bottom. 6. God, your right hand is flexing with power, totally obliterating the enemy. 7. And when you flexed your absolute greatness, you totally wrecked those haters who tried to come at you. You unleashed your furious anger, obliterating them like they were nothing but dry grass on a summer day. 8. And, like, your breath caused the waters to come together, the floods stood up in a big pile, and the deep parts of the sea froze. 9. The hater was like, 'I'm gonna chase after them, catch up to them, and snatch their goods. I'm gonna get what I want, and I'll even whip out my sword and obliterate them with my own hand.' 10. You like totally used your cool wind and the sea was all like whoosh and covered them: they sank like heavy metal in the mega waters. 11. Yo, who even compares to You, LORD? Like seriously, no one can match Your glory, Your holiness, and the way You rock our world with amazing miracles. I mean, talk about setting the bar high! No other gods even come close, ya feel?! 12. You like totally extended your right hand, and the earth just like swallowed them up. 13. You, in your kindness, have led the people you have saved. You have guided them with your power to your sacred dwelling place. 14. When the peeps hear it, they'll be shook: sadness will grip the folks in Palestina. 15. Yo, the Edom dudes gonna be shook; the Moab bad boys gonna be trembling like crazy; everyone in Canaan gonna be straight up melting. 16. They're gonna be freaking out and totally shook when they see how powerful you are, like frozen in place. You're gonna keep them motionless until your people can cross over, Lord, the ones you've totally bought and saved. 17. You gotta take them in and plant them in the dope mountain that's all yours, where you wanna chill, in your holy crib that you built with your hands, Lord. 18. God's gonna be in charge forever and ever, no cap. 19. So like, Pharaoh's whole squad of horses and chariots rolled into the sea, with all the horsemen and stuff. And then, God made the sea go wild and the water came crashing down on them. But the Israelites, man, they straight up walked right through the sea on dry land. No getting wet or nada. 20. And Miriam, the OG prophetess, who happens to be Aaron's sister, grabbed a sick timbrel and led a lit female squad out there, with timbrels and busting out moves. 21. Miriam was like, 'Yo, sing your hearts out to the LORD! He totally crushed it and made those horses and their riders drown in the sea.' 22. So Moses totally led the Israel fam away from the Red Sea and they ventured into this wild place called Shur; and they were trekking through the wilderness for like three whole days, and man, they couldn't find any water anywhere. It was a serious struggle, dude. 23. So they arrived at Marah, but the water there was, like, super undrinkable, too bitter to handle. That's why they ended up naming the place Marah, which basically means bitterness. 24. The peeps were like, Moses, seriously? How we gonna hydrate tho? 25. And he was like, OMG, he called out to the LORD and the LORD was like, 'I gotchu!' He showed him this lit tree, and when he threw it into the water, the water became all sweet and refreshing. Then, right there, he established some cool rules and regulations for them, and also like, tested them, you know? 26. And like, listen up! If you really pay attention to what the LORD your God is saying, and you do what's right in His eyes, and you obey His commandments and keep all His rules, then you won't have to deal with any of the diseases that the Egyptians had to face. Because, y'know, I'm the LORD, the one who heals you and stuff. 27. So they arrived at Elim, which had like, twelve water wells and seventy palm trees, and they set up camp there by the water. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 151. Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 2. The LORD {is} my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he {is} my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him. 3. The LORD {is} a man of war: the LORD {is} his name. 4. Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. 5. The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone. 6. Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. 7. And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, {which} consumed them as stubble. 8. And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, {and} the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea. 9. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. {destroy: or, repossess} 10. Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. 11. Who {is} like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who {is} like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful {in} praises, doing wonders? {gods: or, mighty ones?} 12. Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. 13. Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people {which} thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided {them} in thy strength unto thy holy habitation. 14. The people shall hear, {and} be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. 15. Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. 16. Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be {as} still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, {which} thou hast purchased. 17. Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, {in} the place, O LORD, {which} thou hast made for thee to dwell in, {in} the Sanctuary, O Lord, {which} thy hands have established. 18. The LORD shall reign for ever and ever. 19. For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry {land} in the midst of the sea. 20. And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. 21. And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 22. So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. 23. And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they {were} bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. {Marah: that is Bitterness} 24. And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 25. And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, {which} when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, 26. And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I {am} the LORD that healeth thee. 27. And they came to Elim, where {were} twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 161. So, they packed up and left Elim, and all the Israelites headed to the wilderness of Sin. It's like this spot between Elim and Sinai. They arrived there on the fifteenth day of the second month after leaving Egypt. 2. So, basically all the kids of Israel started complaining about Moses and Aaron while they were chilling in the wilderness:  3. The Israelites were like, 'Ugh, we wish we had died back in Egypt, where we had all the good food and stuff. You just had to bring us out here to the wilderness to starve us all to death.' 4. So, like, God was talking to Moses, right? And He was like, 'Yo Moses, check it out, I'm gonna make it rain bread from heaven for you and the peeps. But here's the deal, they gotta go out and gather just enough for each day. This way, I can test them and see if they'll follow my laws or not.' 5. And like, listen up, on the sixth day, they gotta prep twice as much 'cause that's what they're gonna bring in, ya know? It's gonna be like double the amount of what they gather normally every day. 6. So Moses and Aaron were like, 'Yo, all you peeps of Israel, listen up! When the sun goes down, that's when you'll know for sure that the LORD has totally freed you from the clutches of Egypt. 7. And in the morning, y'all gonna witness the epicness of the LORD. Like seriously, He's listening to all your complaints and stuff. So, like, what's the deal? Why y'all murmuring against us? Who do y'all think we are? 8. So Moses was like, God is gonna hook you up with some meat at night and bread in the morning, cause He knows y'all be complaining. But don't get it twisted, your complaints ain't about us, they're directed at the big man upstairs. 9. So, Moses talked to Aaron and was like, yo, go tell all the Israelite peeps to gather 'round before the LORD. 'Cause He's heard y'all complainin'. 10. So Aaron was like talking to all the kids of Israel, and they like turned their heads towards the wilderness, and boom, the epic glory of the LORD showed up in this cloud thing. 11. So, like, God started talking to Moses, and this is what He said, 12. I caught wind of the gossip among the Israelite squad: tell them this, 'When night falls, you'll feast on some meat, and when morning comes, you won't go hungry because you'll have plenty of bread. And by that, you'll realize that I'm the boss, the LORD your God.' 13. So like, when it got dark, all these quails showed up and totally covered the camp. And when morning came, there was dew everywhere around the whole crew. 14. And like, when the dew was all evaporated, yo, there it was, straight up in the wilderness, this like tiny round thing, hella small, just like the hoar frost on the ground. 15. And when the Israelites saw it, they were like, 'Whoa, dude, what is this stuff?'. And they were like, 'It's totally manna, bro!'. See, they had no clue what it was. So Moses was like, 'Yo, guys, this right here is the bread that the LORD has hooked you up with, so eat up!'. 16. Yo, this is what the LORD wants y'all to do: Gather up enough food for each person in your crew, one omer per person. Make sure you count everyone in your squad and snag enough for everyone in their own tents. Let's do this! 17. So the Israelites did it, and they all collected different amounts, some more, some less. 18. And when they measured it with an omer, the one who gathered lots didn't have any extra, and the one who gathered little didn't go hungry; they each gathered according to what they needed to eat. 19. And Moses was like, yo, don't even think about saving any of that for tomorrow, fam. 20. But they didn't listen to Moses, and some of them didn't finish the food and kept it until the next morning. It got all gross and maggots started coming out of it, and Moses got super angry at them. 21. So like, they would pick it up every morning, each person getting enough for their meal, and like, when it got hot outside, it would just totally melt away. 22. So like, on the sixth day, they hauled in double the bread, two omers for each person. And all the big shots of the crew went up to Moses and spilled the tea. 23. And he was like, yo listen up, this is what the LORD has spoken. Tomorrow is the chill rest day, it's all about the holy sabbath for the LORD. So go ahead and bake whatever you wanna bake today and cook whatever you wanna cook. And if you have any leftovers, just save 'em for tomorrow morning, no biggie. 24. They left it until morning, just like Moses said, and it didn't smell bad or have any worms in it. 25. And Moses was like, yo, grab some grub today 'cause it's the Lord's chill day, fam. Ain't no food in the field today, so get it now. 26. You gotta collect that stuff for six straight days, but on the seventh day, AKA the sabbath, there's gonna be nothing available. 27. So, like, on the seventh day, some peeps went out to gather, but they couldn't find any. 28. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, seriously, how much longer are you gonna keep ignoring my commandments and laws? 29. Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs, the LORD, hooked you up with the sabbath day. So on the sixth day, he's making sure you've got enough bread for two days. Here's the deal: everyone needs to stay put in their own spot on the seventh day, no one should be out and about. 30. And then everyone just chilled out on the seventh day. 31. So the Israelites named it Manna: it looked like coriander seeds, white in color; and it tasted like honey-flavored wafers. 32. Moses was like, yo listen up fam, God wants us to save a portion of this stuff, like an omer, for the future peeps. It's gonna be a reminder of the bread that kept us alive when we were wanderin' in the wilderness, after we dipped outta Egypt. 33. Yo Aaron, grab a pot and fill it up with that fresh manna, then stash it before the LORD as a timeless keepsake for your fam. 34. Aaron did what the LORD told Moses and placed it in front of the Testimony for safekeeping. 35. So, like, the Israel peeps had manna for a solid 40 years, until they finally reached a place with actual people. Manna was their jam, until they made it to the borders of Canaan, you know? 36. So, like, an omer is, like, one-tenth of an ephah. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 161. And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which {is} between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 2. And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 3. And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, {and} when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. 4. Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. {a certain...: Heb. the portion of a day in his day} 5. And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare {that} which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. 6. And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: 7. And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what {are} we, that ye murmur against us? 8. And Moses said, {This shall be}, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what {are} we? your murmurings {are} not against us, but against the LORD. 9. And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. 10. And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. 11. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12. I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD your God. 13. And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. 14. And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness {there lay} a small round thing, {as} small as the hoar frost on the ground. 15. And when the children of Israel saw {it}, they said one to another, It {is} manna: for they wist not what it {was}. And Moses said unto them, This {is} the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. {It is...: or, What is this? or, It is a portion} 16. This {is} the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, {according to} the number of your persons; take ye every man for {them} which {are} in his tents. {for every...: Heb. by the poll, or, head} {persons: Heb. souls} 17. And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. 18. And when they did mete {it} with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. 19. And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 20. Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. 21. And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. 22. And it came to pass, {that} on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one {man}: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. 23. And he said unto them, This {is that} which the LORD hath said, To morrow {is} the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake {that} which ye will bake {to day}, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. 24. And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. 25. And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day {is} a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field. 26. Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, {which is} the sabbath, in it there shall be none. 27. And it came to pass, {that} there went out {some} of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. 28. And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? 29. See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 30. So the people rested on the seventh day. 31. And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it {was} like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it {was} like wafers {made} with honey. 32. And Moses said, This {is} the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. 33. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. 34. As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 35. And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. 36. Now an omer {is} the tenth {part} of an ephah. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 171. So, like, all the Israelites, they were all traveling together, right? They left this place called the wilderness of Sin, after going through a bunch of other places, because the LORD told them to. And then they stopped at this place called Rephidim, you know? But, uh-oh, there was no water for the people to drink! Can you believe that? 2. So the people started complaining to Moses, saying, 'Yo, give us some water to drink.' And Moses was like, 'Why you all gotta be complaining to me? Why you tryna test the LORD?' 3. So everyone was super thirsty and started complaining to Moses, like, 'Why'd you bring us out of Egypt if you're just gonna let us, our kids, and our animals die of thirst? 4. So, Moses hit up the big man upstairs, like, 'Yo, what am I supposed to do with these people? They're about to straight up kill me.' 5. Then God was like, 'Yo Moses, lead the way in front of the people. Grab some of the older peeps from Israel and don't forget that stick you used to hit the river. Hold onto it and start walking.' 6. Yo, listen up! So basically, I'm gonna be chilling on this rock in Horeb, right in front of you. And all you gotta do is give that rock a good smack, and boom! Water will come gushing out of it, quenching the thirst of the people. And guess what? Moses totally pulled it off, with all the elders of Israel watching the whole spectacle go down. 7. So, he named that place Massah and Meribah, all because the Israelites were complaining and testing the Lord, questioning whether He was really with them or not. (Massah means 'Temptation' and Meribah means 'Chiding' or 'Strife') 8. And then, Amalek showed up and started fighting with Israel in Rephidim. 9. And Moses was like, yo Joshua, pick some dudes and let's go battle Amalek. Tomorrow, I'ma be chilling on the hilltop, holding God's rod in my hand. (BTW, Joshua used to be called Jesus, just so you know) 10. Joshua totally followed Moses' instructions and like, went to battle against Amalek. And Moses, Aaron, and Hur, they all went up to the top of the hill, you know? 11. So like, when Moses lifted his hand up, Israel totally dominated, but when he put his hand down, Amalek took the lead. 12. Moses' hands were getting tired, so they grabbed a stone and made him sit on it. Aaron and Hur stood on either side, supporting his hands, and they didn't let them waver until the sun went down. 13. So Joshua totally wrecked Amalek and his crew with some serious sword skills. 14. Yo, God was like, 'Yo, Moses, write this down in a book as a reminder and make sure Joshua hears it, 'cause I'm straight up gonna wipe out any memory of Amalek from the face of the earth.' 15. So Moses totally set up this sick altar and was like, 'Yo, we calling this Jehovahnissi, which means, like, The LORD my banner'. Like, He's our ultimate squad leader, guiding us with His righteous vibes, you feel me? 16. He's like, 'Yo, hear me out. The Lord totally swears that there's gonna be this epic war with Amalek, like, forever! Amalek's got beef with the Lord's throne, so it's on, dude!' \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 171. And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and {there was} no water for the people to drink. 2. Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD? 3. And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore {is} this {that} thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? 4. And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me. 5. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. 6. Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 7. And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not? {Massah: that is, Temptation} {Meribah: that is, Chiding, or, Strife} 8. Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 9. And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand. {Joshua: called Jesus} 10. So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 11. And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 12. But Moses' hands {were} heavy; and they took a stone, and put {it} under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. 13. And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. 14. And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this {for} a memorial in a book, and rehearse {it} in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 15. And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi: {Jehovahnissi: that is, The LORD my banner} 16. For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn {that} the LORD {will have} war with Amalek from generation to generation. {Because...: or, Because the hand of Amalek is against the throne of the LORD, therefore, etc} {the LORD hath...: Heb. the hand upon the throne of the LORD} \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 181. When Jethro, the cool priest of Midian and Moses' father in law, heard about all the epic stuff God did for Moses and the Israel peeps, and how the LORD totally saved Israel from Egypt; 2. So, like, Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought Zipporah, Moses' wife, back to him after Moses had sent her away. 3. And she had two sons; one of them was named Gershom, which means 'a stranger there,' because he said, 'I felt like an outsider in a foreign place.' 4. And the other guy's name was Eliezer, because my dad's God totally had my back and saved me from Pharaoh's sword. Eliezer, like, means 'My God is an help', just so you know. 5. So Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, pulled up with his fam - sons and wife - to chill with Moses out in the wild, where he had set up camp at the mountain of God: 6. And he was like, yo Moses, listen up. It's me, your father-in-law Jethro, sliding into your DMs. I just pulled up with your wife and her two sons, no cap. 7. So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, gave him a respectful greeting, and they exchanged greetings and asked about each other's well-being. Then they went into the tent to hang out. 8. So Moses was like, telling his father-in-law all about how the LORD totally wrecked Pharaoh and the Egyptians because of Israel, and all the crazy stuff they went through on their journey, and how the LORD miraculously saved them. It was real intense, man. 9. And Jethro was stoked AF for all the epic goodness that the LORD had done to Israel, like totally saving them from those crazy Egyptians! 🙌 10. And Jethro was like, woah, shoutout to the Big Guy, the LORD, for saving you from those Egyptians and from Pharaoh, freeing the people from their grip. 11. Dude, I totally get it now. Like, the LORD is legit the biggest boss among all the gods. He totally outshines them with his rad attitude and way above their level of pride. Can't mess with that, man. 12. So Jethro, Moses' father in law, decided to have a little BBQ party for God. Aaron and all the cool elders of Israel showed up to chill and have some grub with Moses' father in law, all in the presence of God. 13. The next day, Moses started settling people's disputes. And all the people lined up to seek judgment from Moses, waiting all day long. 14. When Moses' father-in-law saw everything he was doing to the people, he was like, 'Bro, what's up with this? Why are you doing everything by yourself while everyone else is just waiting around all day? Like, seriously?' 15. So Moses was like, yo, pops, these peeps keep coming to me with all their questions to seek advice from The Big Guy Upstairs: 16. When they have a problem, they hit me up; and I'm out here settling disputes, making sure they're in the know about God's rules and laws. It's like being the official mediator, keeping things fair between them. 17. Yo, Moses' father-in-law was like, 'Bro, what you're doing ain't cool.' 18. You're totally gonna burn out, both you, and everyone around you: 'cause this is way too much for you to handle on your own. You're not gonna be able to pull it off by yourself. (Yo, you're gonna fade away for real, fade away) 19. Yo, listen up! I got some advice for you. God's got your back, so make sure you're representing the people in front of God. Bring their issues directly to Him, bro! 20. And you gotta teach them all the rules and laws, and show them how to live their lives and the things they gotta do. 21. You gotta choose some capable dudes from the crowd, dudes who respect God and always keep it real, dudes who hate being greedy. And put them in charge as leaders of large groups, leaders of smaller groups, leaders of even smaller groups, and leaders of super tiny groups. 22. And let them be the ones to make decisions for the people all the time: big cases they should bring to you, but for the small stuff, they can handle it themselves. That way, you won't be so overwhelmed, and they'll help share the load with you. 23. If you do what God says and He's totally down with it, then you'll be able to handle it and all of your squad will be chill and go to their own turf without any drama. 24. So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 25. So Moses picked some really capable dudes from all over Israel and put them in charge as leaders. They were like head honchos, ruling over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 26. And they were like, constantly judging and stuff: the really complicated cases they took to Moses, but for every little thing they handled it themselves. 27. So Moses said goodbye to his father-in-law and he went back home to his own land. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 181. When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, {and} that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 2. Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back, 3. And her two sons; of which the name of the one {was} Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: {Gershom: that is A stranger there} 4. And the name of the other {was} Eliezer; for the God of my father, {said he, was} mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh: {Eliezer: that is, My God is an help} 5. And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 6. And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. 7. And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of {their} welfare; and they came into the tent. {welfare: Heb. peace} 8. And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, {and} all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and {how} the LORD delivered them. {come...: Heb. found them} 9. And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 10. And Jethro said, Blessed {be} the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 11. Now I know that the LORD {is} greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly {he was} above them. 12. And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God. 13. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. 14. And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What {is} this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? 15. And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God: 16. When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make {them} know the statutes of God, and his laws. {one...: Heb. a man and his fellow} 17. And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest {is} not good. 18. Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that {is} with thee: for this thing {is} too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. {Thou wilt...: Heb. Fading thou wilt fade} 19. Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God: 20. And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. 21. Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place {such} over them, {to be} rulers of thousands, {and} rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 22. And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, {that} every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear {the burden} with thee. 23. If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee {so}, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. 24. So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said. 25. And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. 26. And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. 27. And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 191. In like, the third month, after the kiddos of Israel dipped out of Egypt, they straight up landed in the middle of nowhere, Sinai fam. 2. So they left Rephidim and arrived at the desert of Sinai. They set up camp in the middle of nowhere, and that's where Israel stayed, right in front of the mountain. 3. So Moses went up to talk with God, and the LORD called out to him from the mountain. He said, 'Hey, here's what you gotta tell the house of Jacob and the children of Israel:' 4. Y'all saw the epic stuff I pulled off with the Egyptians, and how I totally carried you like a boss on eagles' wings to bring you closer to me. 5. So, like, if you truly listen to me and follow my rules, you'll be, like, so special to me, better than anyone else. 'Cause, honestly, the whole earth is mine, you know? 6. And you guys will be like a kingdom of priests and a super holy group. These are the words that you should totally say to the children of Israel. 7. So Moses like, showed up and gathered all the older dudes of the crew, and straight up spilled all the words that the LORD told him, right in front of them. 8. And everyone was like, 'Yeah, we're totally down with everything the LORD said, we'll do it all.' Then Moses was like, Wordd!' and told the LORD what the people said. 9. God was like, 'Yo, Moses! I'mma roll through in a dope cloud so the whole squad can hear me when I talk to you and have faith in what you say, 100%. Then Moses went and relayed all the peeps' words to God. 10. God was like, yo Moses, go talk to the peeps and tell 'em to get cleaned up today and tomorrow by washing their clothes. 11. Get ready for the third day because that's when the LORD is gonna roll up on Mount Sinai and everybody's gonna see it go down. 12. Yo, make sure you all stay in your own zone. Don't even think about stepping foot on that mountain or getting too close to it. Anybody who does will straight up get executed, no questions asked. 13. No one better lay a finger on it, or they're gonna get stoned or shot, whether they're an animal or a human! They ain't gonna survive! When that trumpet makes a long sound, everyone better come up to the mountain. (BTW, trumpet can mean cornet too, if you didn't know!) 14. So Moses came down from the mountain to the peeps, and made them all holy and stuff; and they cleaned their fits. 15. And he said to the squad, Get yourselves together by the third day: no flexing on your partners, bro. 16. So, like, after three days in the morning, there were mad thunders, lightnings, and a super thick cloud on the mountain. And the sound of the trumpet was crazy loud, causing everyone in the camp to freak out. 17. So Moses took the people out of the camp to meet up with God, and they all gathered at the foot of the mountain. 18. So like, Mount Sinai was, like, totally covered in smoke because, you know, the LORD came down on it in like, fire. And the smoke, it was going up just, you know, like a big furnace and the whole mountain was, like, shaking like crazy. 19. When the trumpet's sound was blastin' loud, gettin' louder and louder, Moses spoke up and God answered him with a voice. 20. So, God totally appeared on Mount Sinai, right at the tip-top of the mountain. And He called Moses to come up there and Moses was like, 'Sure thing!' and went all the way up. 21. Yo, Moses, listen up. The LORD told him to go down and warn the people not to get too close to the LORD, otherwise they might straight up die. (charge here means to like, seriously contest or challenge Him) 22. Yo, the priests gotta make sure they're all clean and pure before they get close to the LORD, otherwise His wrath might just come down on them. 23. So, Moses was like, 'Yo, God, the people can't go up Mount Sinai. You told us to put boundaries around it and make it holy, remember?' 24. And God was like, 'Yo, go down there and then come back up with Aaron. But make sure the priests and the people don't try to break through and come up to me, because I might just go all out on them.' 25. So Moses went down to the people and started talking to them. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 191. In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they {into} the wilderness of Sinai. 2. For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come {to} the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. 3. And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; 4. Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and {how} I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself. 5. Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth {is} mine: 6. And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These {are} the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. 7. And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. 8. And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. 9. And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. 10. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 11. And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 12. And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, {that ye} go {not} up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: 13. There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether {it be} beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. {trumpet: or, cornet} 14. And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. 15. And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at {your} wives. 16. And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that {was} in the camp trembled. 17. And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. 18. And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. 19. And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 20. And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses {up} to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. 21. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. {charge: Heb. contest} 22. And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. 23. And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. 24. And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. 25. So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 201. So, like, God totally said all this cool stuff, like, 2. I'm the Almighty, your God, who rescued you from Egypt, from a life of slavery. 3. Don't put any other gods before me, period. 4. Don't go making any carved statues or any images of stuff in the sky, on the ground, or underwater. 5. Yo, don't go worshipping other gods or being their servants, 'cause I, the LORD your God, am like super possessive. I keep an eye on those who hate me, and I make sure their kids and grandkids pay for their wrongdoings for, like, the next three or four generations. 6. And like, being super kind to thousands of peeps who like, totally love me and do whatever I say. 7. Don't use God's name as a meaningless phrase, because God won't let you get away with it. 8. Yo, don't forget to vibe on the sabbath day and keep it super sacred. 9. Yo, work hard and grind for six days, and complete all your tasks, fam: 10. Btw, the seventh day is, like, the chill day of the LORD your God. You and your squad, including your fam, your helpers, and even your pets, gotta take a break and not hustle or do any tasks, yo. Also, any outsiders who are hangin' with you should join in on the downtime within your crib. 11. So, like, God totally created everything we see - the sky, the earth, the ocean, and all the living things - in just six days. And then, on the seventh day, He was like, 'I'm gonna take a break'. And because of that, He blessed the seventh day and made it all holy and stuff. 12. Respect your mom and dad, so you can live that long and blessed life on the land God gave you. 🙌 13. Don't take somebody's life, not cool. 14. Don't cheat on your bae. 15. Don't be a thief, fam. 16. Don't go spreading fake news about your homie. 17.

And like, everyone saw the sick thunder and lightning and the crazy loud trumpet noise, and the whole mountain was smokin'! And yo, when the people saw all that, they straight up dipped and stood far away, man. 19. And they were like, 'Yo Moses, you talk to us and we'll listen, but like, don't let God talk to us directly 'cause that's mad scary and we might straight up die.' 20. So, listen up, peeps! Moses was like, 'No worries, fam! God is pulling a test on you to make sure you stay on the right path and don't mess up.' 21. And the peeps stood far away, and Moses slid into the dark vibes where God {was}. 22. And God was like, yo Moses, go tell the peeps of Israel that they saw me straight up chatting with them from heaven. 23. Don't even think about creating silver or gold gods to replace me, alright? Like, just don't. It's a big no-no. 24. Yo, make an earth altar for me and make sacrifices there, offering up your burnt offerings, peace offerings, sheep, and oxen. Whenever I put my name on a spot, I'll show up and bless you. 25. Yo, if you wanna construct an altar for me, don't use no fancy stone carvings. Keep it raw, bro.

Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness {of any thing} that {is} in heaven above, or that {is} in the earth beneath, or that {is} in the water under the earth: 5. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God {am} a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth {generation} of them that hate me; 6. And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 7. Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 8. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 10. But the seventh day {is} the sabbath of the LORD thy God: {in it} thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that {is} within thy gates: 11. For {in} six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them {is}, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 12.

And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God {was}. 22. And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 23.

An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee. 25. And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. {build...: Heb. build them with hewing} 26.

      "Gen Z: Exodus 211. So, like, these are the rules you gotta lay out for them, okay? 2. If you decide to hire a Hebrew homie, they'll work for you for six years straight. But on the seventh year, they dip without paying you a dime. 3. If he rolled solo, he gotta bounce solo: but if he had a wifey, she gotta roll with him. {solo: Hebrew term for with his body} 4. If his boss gave him a partner and they have kids together, the partner and their children belong to the boss, and he can leave on his own. 5. And if the servant is like, 'Yo, I'm all about my master, my wife, and my kids, I ain't bouncin' outta here': 6. So the boss will take him to the judges, like, at the door or by the door post and the boss will pierce his ear with a tool, yo, and he gonna serve him forever. 7. If someone sells his daughter to work as a maidservant, remember that she won't be free like the manservants. 8. If she doesn't make her master happy, who promised to marry her, he should let her go and someone else can buy her. He can't sell her to another country because he was dishonest with her. 9. And if he's like, engaged her to his son, he should treat her like his own daughter, ya know? 10. If he decides to take another {spouse}, he must not neglect providing for her basic needs and fulfilling his marital obligations. 11. But if he doesn't do these three things for her, then she can leave without paying anything. 12. If someone kills another person, they will definitely be sentenced to death. 13. And if a dude isn't plotting, but God puts him in his sights, then I'll set up a spot where he can take shelter. 14. But if a dude intentionally tries to kill his neighbor sneakily, you gotta drag him away from my holy place so he can meet his demise. 15. If anyone attacks their parents, they'll totally face the ultimate consequence of death. 16. If anyone kidnaps and sells another person or if they are caught with them, they will definitely face the death penalty. 17. If anyone disses their parents, they are straight up done for. Like, seriously, they're gonna get the death penalty. Real talk, no exaggeration or anything. Don't mess with fam, bro. #respect 18. And if dudes are like fighting, and one hits the other with a stone or with a fist, and the dude doesn't die but like stays in bed chillin': neighbor, or you know, someone nearby. 19. If the person gets back up and goes out with their homies, the one who hit them will be off the hook, but they gotta compensate for lost time and make sure they're completely healed up. And no, I don't mean in a video game way, I mean like physically healed, bro. No cheat codes here. 20. If someone hits their servant or maid with a rod and causes their death, they will definitely be held accountable and face consequences. {consequences: Hebrew avenged} 21. But if he sticks around for a day or two, he won't be penalized, because he's just settling his dues. 22. If dudes get in a fight and accidentally harm a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry but without any further harm, they should face punishment based on what the woman's husband decides and also pay a fine determined by the judges. 23. And if there's any trouble that happens, then you gotta make up for it by giving a life for a life, 24. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot, 25. Eye for an eye, injury for injury, punishment for punishment. 26. If a person hurts the eye of their servant or maid so badly that it's permanently damaged, they must set them free as compensation for their eye. 27. If someone knocks out their servant's tooth, whether it's a guy or a girl, they have to set them free as compensation for the tooth. 28. If an ox violently injures and kills a person, whether male or female, the ox must without a doubt be stoned to death. Its flesh is not to be consumed, but the owner of the ox will be acquitted of any responsibility. 29. But yo, if that ox has a history of straight up ramming people with its horns and the owner knows about it but didn't do anything to prevent it, and the ox ends up killing someone, then that ox is getting stoned and the owner's gotta face the consequences and be put to death too. 30. If he's asked to pay up, he's gotta cough up whatever amount is demanded to set himself free. 31. If he has hurt a son or a daughter, the consequences will be determined by this judgment. 32. Yo, if an ox goes and pushes a dude or a chick who's like a servant, then the ox gotta pay up thirty shekels of silver to their boss, and they gotta stone the ox. It's like straight up consequences for causing harm, you know. 33. If someone digs a hole and doesn't bother covering it up, and then an ox or donkey falls into it; 34. If you accidentally mess up someone's stuff, you gotta fix it and compensate them. Then, whatever got wrecked becomes the property of the person who lost it. 35. So, like, if one person's ox, like, hurts another person's ox so badly that it, like, dies, then they gotta sell the live ox and split the cash between them. And, yeah, they also gotta split the dead ox as well. Nothing complicated, just fair and square, you know. 36. If it's found out that the ox has a history of charging and the owner didn't control it, then they gotta make it right by giving an ox in return; and the dead animal becomes the owner's responsibility. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 211. Now these {are} the judgments which thou shalt set before them. 2. If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing. 3. If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him. {by himself: Heb. with his body} 4. If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself. 5. And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free: {shall...: Heb. saying shall say} 6. Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever. 7. And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. 8. If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. {please...: Heb. be evil in the eyes of, etc} 9. And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters. 10. If he take him another {wife}; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. 11. And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free without money. 12. He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death. 13. And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver {him} into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. 14. But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die. 15. And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death. 16. And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. 17. And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to death. {curseth: or, revileth} 18. And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with {his} fist, and he die not, but keepeth {his} bed: {another: or, his neighbour} 19. If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote {him} be quit: only he shall pay {for} the loss of his time, and shall cause {him} to be thoroughly healed. {the loss...: Heb. his ceasing} 20. And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished. {punished: Heb. avenged} 21. Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he {is} his money. 22. If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart {from her}, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges {determine}. 23. And if {any} mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, 24. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25. Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. 26. And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake. 27. And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake. 28. If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox {shall be} quit. 29. But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death. 30. If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 31. Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him. 32. If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned. 33. And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 34. The owner of the pit shall make {it} good, {and} give money unto the owner of them; and the dead {beast} shall be his. 35. And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead {ox} also they shall divide. 36. Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall be his own. \n",

Or a goat, if it was a goat and not a sheep. 2. If someone catches a thief breaking in and ends up killing them, they won't be held responsible for it. 3. If it's daylight and he's caught, there will be consequences. He's gotta make things right or face the consequences. If he's broke, he'll have to be sold to pay off his theft. 4.

If someone does something wrong, like taking someone's ox, or ass, or sheep, or clothes, or anything that someone claims is theirs, both sides will bring their case before the judges. Whoever the judges find guilty will have to pay double to their neighbor. 10. If someone gives their neighbor an animal to take care of, like a donkey, or a cow, or a sheep, and it dies, or gets injured, or goes missing, and no one witnessed it happening: 11. So, like, if someone swears by the LORD that they didn't take their neighbor's stuff, they gotta make an oath.

And if someone stole it from him, he's gotta give it back to the owner, like, no questions asked. 13. If it's torn up, bring it as proof and don't fix what got torn. 14. If someone borrows something from their friend and it gets damaged or dies while the owner isn't around, they definitely gotta make it right and fix the situation. 15. If the owner is present, he does not have to compensate for any damages; if it's something that he borrowed, it's his responsibility to return it as it was. 16. If a guy tries to get with a girl who's not engaged yet and they hookup, he's gotta make things right and marry her for real. 17.

And I'm gonna be super mad, like, seriously heated, and I'll totally wreck you with my sword. Plus, your wives will be left without husbands, and your kids without dads. It's gonna be intense, no doubt. 25. If you lend money to any of my peeps who are struggling, don't be all greedy and charge them crazy interest. Be cool and don't make their debt worse. 26. If you ever borrow your friend's clothes as collateral, make sure to give it back to them before the sun sets down: 27. That's just his outfit, man, his clothes for his body. Where's he gonna crash? But yo, when he calls out to me, I got his back. 'Cause I'm all about that kindness. 28. Don't diss the deities and don't trash-talk the leader of your squad. {gods: or, judges} 29.

If you come across your enemy's ox or donkey that's lost, you gotta return it to them, no doubt. 5. If you spot the ride of someone you're not cool with collapsed under its load, and you're thinking of not lending a hand, think again. You gotta join forces and help them out, no doubt. 6.

Only Moses will approach the LORD, but the others gotta keep their distance—no one else can go up there with him. 3. So Moses came and shared with the people everything that the LORD had said, including all the rules and laws. And all the people responded together, saying, 'We're totally down to do everything the LORD wants!' 4. So Moses wrote down everything the LORD said and got up really early in the morning. He made an altar under the hill and built twelve pillars to represent the twelve tribes of Israel. 5. So he picked some cool dudes from the gang of Israel, who were down to offer up some lit burnt offerings and sacrifice some chill peace offerings of oxen to the LORD. 6. So Moses, like, took half of the blood and put it in these, like, fancy bowls, and then he sprinkled the other half of the blood on the altar. 7. And he grabbed the covenant book and started reading in front of everyone. And they were like, 'We got you, God! We're gonna do everything you said and be totally obedient!' 8. And Moses, like, yoinked the blood and sprinkled it on the peeps, and was like, check it out y'all, this blood is the real deal covenant that the LORD made with you about all these words. 9. So Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the OG seventy of Israel's elders all went up: 10. And they, like, totally saw God, right? And under His feet, it was this epic sapphire floor, like so shiny and blue, and it looked like the whole sky was crystal clear. 11. And he didn't harm the leaders of the Israelites, they actually saw God and had a chill time eating and drinking together. 12. Yo, Moses! Listen up! Come chill with me on this epic mountain, and I'll hook you up with some legit stone tablets, a sick code of laws, and commandments that I've personally written. Your job? Spread the wisdom and teach 'em to the people. 13. So Moses and his bro Joshua were like, Timee to climb this lit mountain where God's at' 14.

And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him. 3. And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will we do. 4. And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel. 5. And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD. 6.

And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be obedient. 8. And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled {it} on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you concerning all these words. 9.

And they saw the God of Israel: and {there was} under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in {his} clearness. 11. And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink. 12. And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach them. 13. And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God. 14. And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur {are} with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them. 15. And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. 16.

      "Gen Z: Exodus 281. Yo, Moses, listen up! Grab your bro Aaron and his squad, the sons of Israel. They're gonna help me out as priests: Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, Aaron's boys. 2. And you gotta create some dope threads for your bro Aaron, to flex and look fly. 3. You gotta talk to all the smarts out there, the ones I've filled with lots of wisdom. They're gonna make some fresh outfits for Aaron to set him apart and so he can do his thing as the main priest for me. 4. So here's the deal: they gotta make these dope threads for Aaron, your bro, and his squad. We talkin' a fancy breastplate, an ephod, a rad robe, a sick embroidered coat, a snazzy mitre, and a sick girdle. All these lit garments are gonna be holy AF, ya know? 'Cause Aaron and his boys gotta look fresh when they serve as priests and do their thing for me. 5. And they'll grab some gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen. 6. They gotta make the ephod, word up, outta some fire gold, blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, alongside some sick linen skillfully woven. 7. Like, the two shoulderpieces of the clothing should totally like, be connected at the two edges, and yeah, they should be joined together, you know? 8. The hip accessory on the ephod should also be made of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, just like the rest of it. (The hip accessory can have cool embroidery too, if you want!) 9. So, like, get two sick onyx stones and carve out the names of each and every one of the children of Israel, fam: 10. On one stone, there were six names, and on the other stone, there were six names of the remaining ones, based on when they were born. 11. Yo, carve those two stones like an epic stone engraver, just like those super detailed signet rings. But here's the dope part - you gotta engrave them with the names of all the Israelite homies. Then, slide those bad boys into fancy gold settings, like some boujee jewelry. 12. And you gotta put those two lit stones on the shoulders of the ephod to remember the children of Israel, ya know? And Aaron's gotta flex those names, representin' 'em to the LORD on his sick shoulders as a reminder. 13. And you gotta flex some gold bling on your accessories; 14. And you gotta have these sick gold chains at the ends, man. They gotta be made all fancy with some dope twisted patterns, and then you gotta attach those sick chains to the fancy jewelry pieces. 15. Make the judgment bling with some sick craftsmanship, just like how you made the ephod. Use gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen for this fire piece. 16. It's gonna be a perfect square, twice its size. It'll measure one arm's length in both directions. 17. And you gotta put four rows of stones on it, like, gems n' stuff. The first row is gonna have a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle. It's gonna be all fancy and shiny, man. Oh, and by the way, 'sardius' means 'ruby' 18. And the second row will have an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond, lowkey flexin' with those fancy gems. 19. And the third row had this lit ligure, a cool agate, and a dope amethyst. 20. Yo, in the fourth row, we got some lit gemstones, like beryl, onyx, and jasper. These bad boys gonna be surrounded by some sick gold fillings, ya feel me? 21. And the stones will have the names of the Israel fam, like, twelve of them, yo! Just like how those cool rings have carvings, each stone will have the name of one of the twelve tribes, you feel me? 22. And you gotta add some dope gold chains to the collar of the vest, bro. Make sure they're all fancy and twisted in a sick design. 23. And you gotta make two sick gold rings for the breastplate, and put those dope rings on opposite sides of it. 24. And you gotta, like, attach those two super cool gold chains onto the two rings that are on the ends of the breastplate, ya know? 25. And you'll attach the other ends of the two fancy chains to the two connectors, and place them on the cool shoulder pieces of the ephod in front. 26. And you gotta make two sick gold rings and put them on the sides of the sweet breastplate, right on the edge, near the ephod. 27. You gotta make two more lit gold rings and put them on the sides under the ephod, at the front, opposite to the other ring, above the swaggy belt of the ephod. 28. And they gotta attach the breastplate to the ephod using some blue string, making sure it's above the fancy belt thingy on the ephod, so that the breastplate doesn't come loose from the ephod. 29. And Aaron will wear the names of the Israel fam in his swaggy breastplate when he enters the holy spot, as a dope reminder to the LORD always. 30. And, like, you gotta place the Urim and the Thummim in the judgment breastplate, ya know? They gotta be right on Aaron's heart when he's in front of the LORD. Aaron's gotta carry the judgment of the Israelites on his heart in front of the LORD all the time. 31. And like, you gotta make the ephod's robe totally blue, okay? 32. And there gotta be a gap up there, right in the middle: it's gotta have like a cool woven design all around the gap, kinda like a sick armor vest, so it doesn't get torn. 33. And on the bottom edge of it, you'll make pomegranates in blue, purple, and scarlet all around. And there'll be golden bells interspersed amongst them along the edge. 34. Like, there's this sick bell made of gold and a totally rad pomegranate, and they're both, like, attached to the edge of this epic robe. 35. Aaron's gotta rock his ministry vibes with all his sound as he enters the divine spot before the LORD. He's gotta keep it chill when he steps out, or else he'll be straight up gone. 36. You gotta create a sick gold plate and carve on it, like, some epic designs just like those fancy ring engravings. It's gonna say 'HOLINESS TO THE LORD', ya feel me? 37. And you should totally accessorize with a cool blue lace, so that it's all fancy on the mitre; make sure it goes right smack on the front of the mitre, no doubts! 38. And Aaron will have something on his forehead, to take the blame for the holy stuff, the special gifts from the Israelites. It will always be on his forehead, so that they will be cool with the LORD. 39. And you gotta flex that fresh af coat made outta fancy linen, and you gotta craft that lit AF hat, also made outta fine linen. Oh, and don't forget to slay with that 🔥 needlework belt, fam. 40. So, like, make some really cool outfits for Aaron's sons. They gotta have rad coats, trendy girdles, and, like, stylish bonnets to rock. It's all about flexing that glory and beauty, you know? 41. And you'll, like, totally dress up Aaron, your bro, and his squad with him. Then, you gotta anoint them, consecrate them, and make them pure AF so they can do their thing as priests for me. Ya know, perform all those holy duties and stuff. {consecrate...: Heb. fill their hand} 42. Yo, you gotta make them some sick linen shorts to cover up their 🍑 - from the waist all the way down to the thighs, fam. 43. And when Aaron and his sons go into the hangout spot or approach the stage to do their thing, they should always wear these dope clothes, so they don't mess up and suffer the consequences, like, no way. It's a forever rule for Aaron and his fam, for real. \n",

      "Gen Z: Exodus 291. So here's what you gotta do to make them holy and serve me as priests: Grab a really young bull and two flawless rams. 2. And like, you gotta make them unleavened bread, and cakes without yeast mixed with oil, and wafers without yeast smeared with oil, and make them all with wheat flour. 3. And you gotta gather them all up and toss 'em in one basket, then bring the whole basket over with the bullock and the two rams. 4. Yo, bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the hangout spot, the tabernacle. Then, give 'em a proper rinse with some water. 5. And yo, grab the fresh fits and slide 'em on Aaron. Put the coat, the robe of the ephod, the ephod, and the breastplate on him. And make sure you secure that dope belt of the ephod around his waist, no cap: 6. And you're gonna like, totally slap the mitre on his head, and then place the holy crown on top of the mitre. It's gonna be so lit! 7. Then you gotta grab the anointing oil and pour that thing over his head, giving him a fresh anointing. 8. And you gotta bring his sons, and dress them in some sick threads. 9. And you gotta hook them up with dope belts, Aaron and his homies, and put those cool hats on them: and they're gonna be priests forever, and you gotta make Aaron and his squad official. 10. Yo, you gotta bring a bullock in front of the tabernacle with all the peeps gatherin', and Aaron and his homies gotta lay their hands on the bullock's head, ya feel? 11. You gotta slaughter that bullock right in front of the LORD, ya know? Just do it at the entrance of the tabernacle where everyone gathers. 12. And you gotta take some of the bull's blood, and with your finger, dab it on the horns of the altar. Then pour the rest of the blood right at the base of the altar. 13. So you gotta grab all the internal fat, including the layer over the liver, which seems to be the midriff according to anatomy experts, plus both kidneys and their fat. Then set it all on fire on the altar. 14. Bro, you gotta incinerate the bullock's flesh, skin, and dung outside the camp. It's, like, an offering to make up for sinning. 15. Yo, grab a ram and have Aaron and his squad lay hands on its head. 16. And like, you gotta totally take out the ram, right? Then, you grab some of its blood and sprinkle it all around the altar, man. 17. Yo, you gotta chop up that ram into pieces, clean out its insides and legs, and then put 'em back together with its head. Like, stack 'em up or somethin'. It's all part of the deal. 18. You gotta light up the whole ram on the altar, it's like a big sacrifice for the LORD. It's gonna create some awesome vibes, like a fire offering for the LORD. 19. Then you gotta grab the other ram, and Aaron and his crew will lay their hands on its head, dude. 20. So, like, you gotta slay the ram and grab some of its blood. Then you gotta apply that blood to the top of Aaron's right ear, and his sons' right ears too. And you also gotta put it on the thumb of their right hand and the big toe of their right foot. Oh, and don't forget to sprinkle that blood all around the altar. 21. Yo, grab some of that blood from the altar and mix it with the anointing oil. Then, spray it all over Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes too. This way, they'll be super holy, along with their clothes and their sons' clothes too. 22. And don't forget, grab some of the juicy fat and the booty, and the fat that's hiding the guts, and the cool-looking liver skin, and the two kidneys, and the fat on top of them, and also the right shoulder; 'cause this ram is gonna be lit for the ceremony: 23. And like, there's this whole vibe with this one loaf of bread, and this cake of oiled bread, and this wafer from the basket of the unleavened bread that's in front of the LORD, you know? 24. You gotta hand over everything to Aaron and his crew, and then give 'em a little wave as an offering to the big man upstairs. Shake it, shake it, ya know? 25. You'll take them from their hands and burn them on the altar as a burnt offering, creating a pleasant smell for the Lord. It's a fire offering to the Lord. 26. Now grab the ram's chest from Aaron's special ceremony, and give it a dope wave in front of the LORD as an offering. It's gonna be your part, fam. 27. And you gotta make the boob of the wavy gift and the flexed shoulder, the one that's like up in the air, from the ram that's dedicated, specifically for Aaron and his homies: 28. So, like, this thing is gonna belong to Aaron and his crew forever, as a rule for the peeps of Israel. It's, like, this special offering that the Israelites gotta give, like, from their peace offerings – you know, the ones they sacrifice – it's, like, their way of showing respect and making an offering to the LORD. 29. And like, Aaron's kids are totally gonna inherit his sacred outfits, ya know? They're gonna get anointed and consecrated in them too! 30. The son who becomes a priest in his place will wear these clothes for seven days whenever he enters the gathering spot to serve in the sacred area. 31. Yo, you gotta grab that ram for the dedication and cook its meat up in the sacred crib. 32. So, Aaron and his squad gonna chow down on that ram meat and the bread from the basket right outside the tabernacle of the crew. 33. And they shall feast upon those things that were used for the atonement, in order to make them sacred and pure. But someone unfamiliar cannot partake of them, for they are considered holy. 34. And if there's any leftover sacred food or bread by the next day, you gotta burn it up - no munching on it, 'cause it's hella holy. 35. So here's what you gotta do for Aaron and his homies, follow all the instructions I gave you, and for a whole week, make sure they're all set-apart. 36. And like, every day you gotta offer a bull as a sin offering to make up for your mistakes, you know? Don't forget to clean the altar and stuff after you've made up for it, and then put some special oil on it to make it all holy and pure. 37. For a full week, you gotta make things right with the altar, giving it a holy vibe. It's gonna be the holiest altar ever, so anything that comes near it becomes holy too. 38. Okay, so here's what you gotta do for the altar vibes: bring two lambs every day that are like totally fresh, you know, still in their first year. 39. You gotta sacrifice one lamb in the morning, and another lamb in the evening, fam: 40. And like, with that one lamb, you gotta take a tenth deal of flour and mix it with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil. Oh, and don't forget the fourth part of an hin of wine for that drink offering, you know? 41. And, like, the second lamb should be offered in the evening, following the same vibes as the morning meal offering and drink offering. It's all about creating that delicious aroma and offering it up to the LORD, you know, with fire and everything. 42. This is gonna be, like, a forever burnt offering thing for all y'all in the upcoming generations. It's gonna happen right at the door of the tabernacle where everyone gathers to hang with the LORD. That's where I'll meet up with you and chat it up. 43. And that's where I'll hang out with the Israelites, and make the special place/hangout spot super holy with my awesomeness. (or, the special place/hangout spot: or, Israel) 44. And I'll make the tabernacle and the altar totally sacred, like on a whole new level, you know? I'll make sure Aaron and his crew, his sons, are also hella sacred, so they can serve me as priests, doing their thing in the house of worship. 45. And I'm gonna hang out with the Israel fam, and be their ultimate squad leader. 46. And they'll totally know that I, like, I'm the LORD their God, who totally brought them out of Egypt, so I can like, live with them and stuff. I'm like, for real, the LORD their God. \n",

And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to consecrate {and} to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat {thereof}, because they {are} holy. 34. And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it {is} holy. 35. And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all {things} which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. 36. And thou shalt offer every day a bullock {for} a sin offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 37. Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy. 38. Now this {is that} which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first year day by day continually. 39. The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even: 40. And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine {for} a drink offering. 41. And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 42. {This shall be} a continual burnt offering throughout your generations {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee. 43. And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and {the tabernacle} shall be sanctified by my glory. {the tabernacle: or, Israel} 44. And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest's office. 45. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. 46. And they shall know that I {am} the LORD their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I {am} the LORD their God. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 301. And you gotta make this dope altar for burnin' incense, yo. Use some lit shittim wood to make it, man. 2. It's gonna be a square, dude. A whole cubit long and a whole cubit wide. And check this, it's gonna be two cubits tall. And the horns? They gotta match, man. 3. And you gotta cover it with like, legit gold, all over the top, the sides, even the horns. And make it like, a sick gold crown all around. {top: In Hebrew, it's called 'roof'.} {sides: In Hebrew, it's called 'walls'.} 4. And you gotta make two dope golden rings underneath its crown, right at the two corners, on the two sides of it. These rings will be where the staves go so you can carry it around in style. (corners: Hebrew for ribs, ya dig?) 5. And you gotta craft the handles with fine wood and flex on it with a gold coating. 6. And you should place it in front of the curtain by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that's on top of the testimony, where I'll chill with you. 7. And Aaron, like, needs to totally burn some sweet incense on it every morning, you know? Like, when he's lighting up the lamps, he's gotta burn incense on it too. And by 'sweet incense,' I mean this wicked incense made of awesome spices, ya feel me? 8. And when Aaron sets up the lamps later in the day, he should burn some really good incense on it, like, forever, as an offering to the LORD that will keep going for generations. (lighteth: like, sets up, ya know) (at even: like, between the two evenings) 9. Don't use any random incense, burn sacrifices, offer meat, or pour drinks on it. 10. And Aaron gotta do this thing once a year, put some blood on the horns and make a big apology to God for all the sins. Every year, without fail, he's gotta make this apology to keep things in line. It's like super-duper holy and important to the LORD. 11. God was like, Mosess, listen up!' 12. Yo, when you count up the Israelites, each one gotta pay up some cash to the LORD as a way to protect themselves. This way, no nasty plagues gonna wreak havoc when you tally 'em all. Just sayin', ya gotta count the right peeps. 13. Everyone who is counted among them must give half a shekel, following the value of the sanctuary shekel (which is twenty gerahs). This half shekel shall be an offering to the LORD. 14. Anyone over the age of 20 has to pitch in and make an offering to the LORD when they're counted. 15. The people with money shouldn't give more than half a shekel, and the people who don't have much shouldn't give less when they offer something to the LORD to fix their soul. So, everyone's contribution is fair, no one is giving too much or too little. 16. So, like, you gotta collect the money from the Israelites and allocate it for the maintenance of the meeting place. It's a way for them to like, remember and honor their connection with God and seek forgiveness for their souls, you know? 17. So God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,' 18. You gotta make a sick bronze sink with a bronze stand, for all your cleansing needs. It's gotta be placed between the hangout spot and the holy place, and filled up with water, bro. 19. So Aaron and his squad gotta clean their hands and feet, yo: 20. Whenever they step inside the meeting spot, they gotta scrub up with water, or else they'll suffer the consequences; and when they come close to the platform to serve and light up an offering for the LORD: 21. So they gotta clean their hands and feet, otherwise they'll die: and it's gonna be like a forever rule for them, like for them and their fam for all future generations. 22. Yo, the LORD was like, talking to Moses, and He said, 23. Yo, grab these lit spices: 500 shekels of pure myrrh, 250 shekels of sweet cinnamon (not gonna lie, half of that), and another 250 shekels of sweet calamus. 24. And like, they used like 500 shekels of cassia, you know, the special shekel used in the sanctuary, and like an hin of olive oil. 25. And you gotta mix up some lit holy oil, like a boss apothecary. It's gonna be holy AF and used for anointing. {apothecary: or, perfumer} 26. And you gotta like, totally put some sacred oil on the whole church hangout, along with that super important box of witness stuff. 27. And like, the table and all its stuff, and the lamp thingy and its stuff, and the cool incense altar, 28. And the place where they burned stuff, and all the stuff they used to do it, and the fancy sink and its stand. 29. And, like, you gotta make them super pure, so that they're, like, crazy holy. Anything that comes into contact with them will also be holy, no doubt! 30. And you gotta get Aaron and his squad all hyped up and legit, and set them apart, so they can serve me like bosses in the priest game. 31. Yo, listen up, Israelites! So, here's the deal, this here oil is gonna be super sacred and special, like forever and ever, like for all you future peeps too. 32. Don't pour that stuff on people and don't try to make a copycat version of it, 'cause it's special and it's supposed to stay special, okay? It's all about being sacred and important to you guys. 33. If anyone tries to make something similar to it, or if anyone puts it on someone they don't know, they'll be totally ditched by their crew. 34. Yo, Moses, listen up! God's like, 'Get yourself some dope spices: stacte, onycha, and galbanum - all legit fresh. And don't forget that pure frankincense, gotta be the same amount of each, ya feel? 35. And you gotta whip up a lit fragrance, like a mad mixologist, blending it all together, pure and sacred. It's gotta be seasoned, like with some salt, ya know? 36. And you gotta like, totally grind {some} of it real fine, and place it in front of the important thing in the gathering place, where I'll meet up with you. It's gonna be super sacred, no joke. 37. And when you're making perfume, don't try and copy its recipe for yourself. It's supposed to be special and dedicated to the LORD. 38. Anyone who copies that and tries to imitate it, just to be cool, will be totally banned from their squad. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 301. And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: {of} shittim wood shalt thou make it. 2.

And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. {top: Heb. roof} {sides: Heb. walls} 4. And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make {it}; and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. {corners: Heb. ribs} 5. And thou shalt make the staves {of} shittim wood, and overlay them with gold. 6. And thou shalt put it before the vail that {is} by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy seat that {is} over the testimony, where I will meet with thee. 7. And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. {sweet incense: Heb. incense of spices} 8. And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. {lighteth: or setteth up: Heb. causeth to ascend} {at even: Heb. between the two evenings} 9. Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon. 10. And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it {is} most holy unto the LORD. 11. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12. When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when {thou} numberest them. {their number: Heb. them that are to be numbered} 13. This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel {is} twenty gerahs:) an half shekel {shall be} the offering of the LORD. 14. Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD. 15. The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when {they} give an offering unto the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. {give more: Heb. multiply} {give less: Heb. diminish} 16. And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls. 17. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18. Thou shalt also make a laver {of} brass, and his foot {also of} brass, to wash {withal}: and thou shalt put it between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein. 19. For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: 20. When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: 21. So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, {even} to him and to his seed throughout their generations. 22. Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23. Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred {shekels}, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, {even} two hundred and fifty {shekels}, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty {shekels}, 24. And of cassia five hundred {shekels}, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: 25.

And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and the ark of the testimony, 27. And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels, and the altar of incense, 28. And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and his foot. 29.

      "Gen Z: Exodus 311. So, God was talking to Moses, like, 2. Look, I just tapped Bezaleel, Uri's kid, Hur's grandson, from Team Judah, you know: 3. And I've given him this mad Godly vibe, like he's totally smart, understanding, knowledgeable, and can whip up anything with his mad skills. 4. To come up with epic creations, to flex our skills with gold, silver, and brass, 5. And like, they were totally into like cutting stones and setting them, you know? And they were also like carving timber and doing all sorts of amazing craftsmanship. 6. And yo, listen up, I've hooked up Aholiab, Ahisamach's kid from the Dan tribe, to work alongside him. And all the wise peeps out there, I've blessed 'em with mad skills and wisdom to make everything I told you. 7. The hangout spot, and the epic chest, and the chill throne on top, and all the cool stuff inside the hangout spot, you know, the stuff that's like, furniture or whatever. 8. And the table and all its stuff, and the dope candlestick with all its cool stuff, and the incense altar, {stuff: Hebrew term for vessels} 9. And the altar where they burn things up, together with all its stuff, and the basin and its stand, 10. And the lit outfits for doing the work, and the sacred threads for Aaron the priest, and the drip outfits for his squad, to flex while on duty in the priest zone, 11. And don't forget to bring the dope anointing oil and some fire incense for the holy spot. Make sure you follow all the lit instructions I'm giving you, no cap. 12. Yo, God talked to Moses and said, 13. Hey, listen up, Israelites! Here's the deal: You gotta honor and observe my sabbaths. They're like a special symbol that connects us for all generations, reminding you that I'm the one who sets you apart and makes you holy. 14. So, like, you have to totally observe the Sabbath day! It's, like, super sacred to you, you know? Anyone who messes with it is, like, seriously in trouble - they'll totally face death! 'Cause, like, if anyone does any kind of work on that day, they'll be completely cut off from their peeps. 15. You can grind for six days straight, but on the seventh day, it's time to chill and show respect to the Big Guy upstairs. Anyone who decides to hustle on the Sabbath day will face some serious consequences, like a one-way ticket to the afterlife. No joke, that day is all about holiness. 16. So, like, the Israelites gotta totally chill on the sabbath day, keep it sacred forever as a promise, no joke. 17. This is, like, a legit symbol between me and the squad of Israel, forever and ever: because the big man upstairs, like, totally crushed it in making the whole universe in just six days, and then on day seven he took a chill pill, ya know, and got reenergized. 18. And then God gave Moses two stone tablets as a way to communicate with him on Mount Sinai. These tablets were like receipts or evidence, straight from the divine source, handwritten by God himself. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 311. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah: 3. And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 4. To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 5. And in cutting of stones, to set {them}, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 6. And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; 7. The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that {is} thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle, {furniture: Heb. vessels} 8. And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense, {furniture: Heb. vessels} 9. And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot, {furniture: Heb. vessels} 10. And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office, 11. And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy {place}: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do. 12. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13. Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it {is} a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that {ye} may know that I {am} the LORD that doth sanctify you. 14. Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it {is} holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth {any} work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 15. Six days may work be done; but in the seventh {is} the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth {any} work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death. {holy: Heb. holiness} 16. Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, {for} a perpetual covenant. 17. It {is} a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for {in} six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed. 18. And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 321. So, like, when the crowd peeped that Moses was taking forever to come down from the mount, they all gathered around Aaron and were like, 'Dude, get off your butt and make us some gods to lead the way! We have no clue what happened to this Moses guy who saved us from Egypt.' 2. So Aaron was like, yo dudes, go snatch those sick gold hoops from your wives, sons, and daughters and hand 'em over to me. 3. So, like, everyone just, like, totally took off their sick golden earrings from their ears and brought them to Aaron, man. 4. And he took it from them and shaped it with a cool engraving tool, after he had melted it into a calf shape. And they were like, 'Yo, these are your gods, oh Israel, they totally brought you out of Egypt!' 5. And when Aaron saw that, he was like, 'Yo, let's build an altar right here.' And Aaron, like, made this announcement and was like, 'Just so you know, tomorrow we're gonna have this lit feast for the LORD, so be there or be square.' 6. The next day, they got up early and made burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. Then the people chilled, ate, drank, and had a good time. 7. So, like, God told Moses, 'Dude, go down there right now! Your people that you rescued from Egypt totally messed up and corrupted themselves!' 8. OMG, they totally ditched the path I told them to follow! Like, they created a super cool golden calf, started worshipping it, and even offered sacrifices to it. And get this, they were like, 'Yo, Israel, these are your gods who totally saved you from Egypt!' 9. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, check it out, I've noticed these peeps and let me tell you, they are hella stubborn! 😤 10. Yo, just back off for a sec, I need to let out some steam and go off on them, and maybe even wipe them out. But don't worry, I got big plans for you—I'll make you the founder of an epic nation. 11. So Moses straight up went to God and was like, 'Yo Lord, why you gotta be so heated with your people? I mean, you literally flexed your power and rescued them from Egypt with mad strength!' 12. Bruh, why would the Egyptians be talking smack like, 'He only brought them outta here to mess 'em up and kill 'em in the mountains, wiping 'em off the face of the earth!' Yo, chill out with that anger and change your mind about bringing disaster on your own people, aight? 13. Yo, chill for a sec and remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, those homies who you made a promise to. You were like, 'Bro, I swear on my own self, I'm gonna make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky, and this whole land I'm talking about will be theirs forever.' 14. And God changed His mind about the bad stuff He was gonna do to His people. 15. So Moses turned and went down from the mountain, holding the two tablets with the commandments. These tablets had writing on both sides, y'know? It was like a double-sided message from God. 16. The tables were made by God, and the writing was God's own writing, carved into the tables. 17. Yo, when Joshua heard all that commotion from the peeps shoutin', he goes up to Moses and says, 'Bro, there's like a war goin' down in the camp, man.' 18. And he was like, yo, that's not the sound of people flexing or whining about getting defeated. Nahh, it's the sweet sound of those who are killing it with their amazing voices. #PowerOfMusic 19. So, like, when Moses got close to the camp, he saw the whole calf thing and everyone dancing. Let me tell you, his anger was off the charts! He straight up throws the tablets out of his hands and smashes them right at the foot of the mountain. 20. So, like, he took the calf they had made and straight up roasted it in the fire. Then, he like totally crushed it into powder and sprinkled it on the water. And to complete the vibe, he made the children of Israel drink from it. Can you imagine?! 21. Yo Aaron, what did these people do to you that made you bring down such a massive sin on them? 22. And Aaron was like, yo chill, my dude. You know these people, they always up to no good. 23. So they were like, um, make us gods to lead us 'cause, you know, we don't know what happened to this Moses guy who brought us out of Egypt. 24. So I was like, 'Yo, if anyone's got any gold, just break it off and hand it to me.' And boom, they actually did it. So I straight up tossed that gold into the fire and guess what? This freaking calf popped out. 25. And when Moses peeped that the people were like, totally exposed (cuz Aaron made them expose themselves, which was, like, super embarrassing in front of their haters, you know?) 26. So Moses pulls up at the entrance of the camp, and he's like, yo, who's down to ride with the Lord? Come roll up on me. And all the Levites gathered up and joined his squad. 27. Yo, listen up! The LORD God of Israel has a message for y'all. Grab your swords and walk around the whole camp, from gate to gate. And here's the deal: take out your own brother, your best friend, and even your neighbor. It's time to bring the heat, fam. 28. So, the Levi squad was like, totally following what Moses said, and like, that day, about three thousand dudes bit the dust. 29. Moses was like, yo, take this seriously and show mad respect to the LORD today. Each person, including fathers and brothers, gotta be all in, so we can get blessed, like big time. #TeamLORD #BlessedDay 30. The next day, Moses told the peeps, 'Y'all messed up big-time and sinned real bad. But don't trip, I'm gonna go talk to the LORD and see if I can make it right for ya.' 31. So Moses went back to the LORD and was like, 'Yo, these people totally messed up - they straight up went and made themselves some gold idols to worship.' 32. But like, if you're down to forgive their mistake, awesome; but if not, could you just like, remove me from that book you made? 33. And God was like, yo Moses, anyone who disrespects me, I'm straight up erasing them from my record book. 34. Okay, so here's the plan: go and guide the people to the spot I told you about. You gotta trust me on this one, because my angel is gonna accompany you. But here's the thing, when the time comes and I pay them a visit, I'll totally hold them accountable for their sins. 35. Yo, God straight up punished the peeps for makin' that calf, the one Aaron whipped up. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 321. And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for {as for} this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 2. And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which {are} in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring {them} unto me. 3. And all the people brake off the golden earrings which {were} in their ears, and brought {them} unto Aaron. 4. And he received {them} at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These {be} thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 5. And when Aaron saw {it}, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow {is} a feast to the LORD. 6. And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. 7. And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted {themselves}: 8. They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These {be} thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 9. And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it {is} a stiffnecked people: 10. Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 11. And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? {the LORD: Heb. the face of the LORD} 12. Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. 13. Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit {it} for ever. 14. And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. 15. And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony {were} in his hand: the tables {were} written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other {were} they written. 16. And the tables {were} the work of God, and the writing {was} the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 17. And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, {There is} a noise of war in the camp. 18. And he said, {It is} not the voice of {them that} shout for mastery, neither {is it} the voice of {them that} cry for being overcome: {but} the noise of {them that} sing do I hear. {being...: Heb. weakness} 19. And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. 20. And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt {it} in the fire, and ground {it} to powder, and strawed {it} upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink {of it}. 21. And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? 22. And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they {are set} on mischief. 23. For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for {as for} this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 24. And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break {it} off. So they gave {it} me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. 25. And when Moses saw that the people {were} naked; (for Aaron had made them naked unto {their} shame among their enemies:) {their enemies: Heb. those that rose up against them} 26. Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who {is} on the LORD'S side? {let him come} unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. 27. And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, {and} go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. 28. And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 29. For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. {For Moses...: or, And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, because every man hath been against his brother, etc} {Consecrate...: Heb. Fill your hands} 30. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. 31. And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 32. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 33. And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. 34. Therefore now go, lead the people unto {the place} of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. 35. And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 331. So, God was like, 'Hey Moses, peace out and head on out of here with the crew you saved from Egypt. We're jetting off to the land I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where your descendants will score big time.' 2. I got your back with an angel squad; those Canaanite, Amorite, and Hittite peeps, as well as the Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite, they're getting yeeted outta here! 3. To a rad land with all the yummy stuff: 'cause I won't roll with you peeps since you're stubborn AF. Don't wanna end up obliterating you on the way. 4. When the people heard this bad news, they were so bummed out that none of them bothered to get all fancy with their bling. 5. The LORD told Moses to tell the children of Israel that they're being stubborn. I'm gonna show up and take care of business real quick, so take off your fancy stuff. I need to figure out what I'm gonna do with you all. 6. So, the Israelites totally ditched their bling at Mount Horeb. 7. So Moses grabbed the tabernacle and set it up outside the camp, a good distance away. He named it the Tabernacle of the gathering. And guess what? Whenever people wanted to connect with the LORD, they would leave the camp and head over to the tabernacle of the gathering that was outside the camp. 8. So, like, Moses left his crib and headed over to the tabernacle, and when he did, all the people got up and stood outside their own tents, just peeping at Moses until he disappeared into the tabernacle. 9. So, like, Moses goes into the tabernacle, right? And then, this rad cloudy pillar comes down and chills at the entrance, ya know. And then, boom, God starts chatting with Moses. 10. And everyone saw the cool cloud thingy chillin' by the entrance of the tent, and everyone stood up and worshipped, each person at their own tent door. 11. God straight up talked to Moses like they were besties, like just chatting it up. Then Moses went back to the camp, but his homie Joshua, who was a young dude, stayed in the tabernacle the whole time. No breaks. 12. So Moses was like, 'Yo, God! You're telling me to bring up these people, but you haven't told me who you're gonna send with me. But you did say that you know me and you've found favor with me. 13. Yo, like, if you're diggin' me and showing me love, can you drop some knowledge on me? I wanna understand your ways, get to know you better, and keep your favor. Oh, and don't forget, we're your own peeps, so keep us in mind. 14. And he was like, don't worry fam, I'll totally stick by your side and hook you up with some much-needed chill vibes. 15. And he's like, if you're not gonna come with us, then we shouldn't even bother leaving this place. 16. Like, how can we even know that you're cool with us if you don't actually roll with us? That's like the ultimate proof that we're totally set apart from everyone else on this planet. 17. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, I got you. I'm totally gonna do what you've asked, because you're super cool in my book and I totally know you like really well.' 18. And he was like, yo, can you please let me see your awesomeness? 19. And he was like, I'll totally flex all my goodness right in front of you, and I'll drop the name of the LORD on you; and I'll be super chill with those I wanna be, and I'll show some mad mercy to those I wanna show mercy to. 20. And he was like, bro, you can't see my face, man. Like, no one can see me and still be alive, you know? 21. Yo, the LORD was like, check it out, I got this dope spot right next to me, and you gonna be posted up on a solid rock, fam: 22. And it's gonna happen when I flex my awesomeness, I'll place you in this dope spot in the rocks, and I'll totally shield you with my hand as I walk by:  23. And I'll pull back my hand, and you'll catch a glimpse of my backside: but my face isn't gonna show up in the selfie. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 331. And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, {and} go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it: 2. And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: 3. Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou {art} a stiffnecked people: lest I consume thee in the way. 4. And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments. 5. For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye {are} a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee. 6. And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb. 7. And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, {that} every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which {was} without the camp. 8. And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, {that} all the people rose up, and stood every man {at} his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. 9. And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood {at} the door of the tabernacle, and {the LORD} talked with Moses. 10. And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand {at} the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man {in} his tent door. 11. And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. 12. And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. 13. Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation {is} thy people. 14. And he said, My presence shall go {with thee}, and I will give thee rest. 15. And he said unto him, If thy presence go not {with me}, carry us not up hence. 16. For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? {is it} not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that {are} upon the face of the earth. 17. And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. 18. And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. 19. And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. 20. And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. 21. And the LORD said, Behold, {there is} a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: 22. And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: 23. And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 341. So, the LORD was like, 'Yo, Moses! Grab some stone tablets, just like the ones before, and I'll write the same words on them that were on the first tablets you broke.' 2. Be prepared and head up to Mount Sinai in the morning. Meet me at the top of the mountain. 3. No one can join you, nobody should be visible on the entire mountain, and the animals shouldn't graze near the mountain. 4. So he made two stone tablets just like the first ones. Then, early in the morning, Moses went up to Mount Sinai as the LORD told him, taking the two stone tablets with him. 5. And God like, came down in this totally lit cloud, and stood with him, and started announcing His epic name. 6. And then God rolled up, flexed, and was like, 'Yo, I'm God, the one and only. I'm all about showing mercy, grace, being patient, and overflowing with goodness and truth.' 7. God is all about showing mercy to countless people, forgiving their wrongdoings and sins. But that doesn't mean the guilty can just be let off the hook. There are consequences for the actions of the previous generations that can affect the children and even the grandchildren for a few generations. 8. Moses quickly bowed down and showed his respect by worshipping. 9. And he was like, yo, if I've scored some major chill vibes with you, Lord, can you pleeease roll with us? 'Cause, let's be real, we can be a pretty stubborn crowd. But, like, forgive us for our wrongdoings and accept us as your chosen crew, you know? 10. And he was like, yo, listen up, I'm about to drop a major flex: in front of all your squad, I'm gonna pull off some mind-blowing tricks that no one has ever seen before, no cap! And all the peeps in your crew will witness the epic power moves of the LORD, 'cause what I'm about to do is straight-up mind-blowing! 11. Yo, listen up! Pay attention to what I'm telling you today: check it out, I'm about to kick out the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite right in front of you. 12. Yo, listen up fam, be careful not to get yourself caught up in a sketchy deal with the peeps living in the land you're headed to. It could totally trap you and mess you up big time. So watch out! 13. But y'all gotta wreck their altars, smash their statues, and chop down their fancy nature spots. 14. Yo, don't even think about worshipping other gods, 'cause the LORD, who goes by Jealous, is super possessive about being the only God. 15. Make sure you don't sign up for a collab with the locals, 'cause they'll totally ditch their values and start chasing after their own idols. They'll try to convince you to join in on their sacrifices, even slide into your DMs and invite you to feast on their offerings. 16. So, like, if you end up getting with their daughters and stuff, you know? And their daughters start chasing after gods that aren't cool, dragging your sons along with them. It's a total mess. 17. Don't even think about creating any lit AF idols, fam. 18. Yo, gotta celebrate the feast of unleavened bread, fam. For a whole week, you gotta chow down on that unleavened bread, just like I told you, during the month of Abib. 'Cause it was in that month that you made that epic escape from Egypt, yo. 19. I've got dibs on any animal born first, whether it's a cow, sheep, or goat. That's my rule. 20. But if your firstborn donkey has to be redeemed, replace it with a lamb; and if you don't redeem it, then you have to break its neck. You have to redeem all your firstborn sons, no one should come before me empty-handed. (lamb: or, kid) 21. You gotta hustle for six days straight, but on the seventh day, it's time to chillax. Whether it's planting season or harvesting time, take a breather and recharge. 22. And you gotta celebrate the lit party of weeks, when the first dope crops of wheat come in, and the epic feast of gathering at the end of the year. *year's end: in Hebrew, it means the crazy circle of the year* 23. Like, three times a year, all your dudes gotta show up in front of the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. 24. Because I'm gonna flex and push those other nations aside, and make your territory super-sized. No one's gonna even think about snatching up your land while you're on your way to worship the LORD your God three times a year. 25. Yo, don't mix leaven with the blood of my sacrifice, and don't leave any leftovers from the Passover feast till morning. 26. Make sure to offer the first and best of your crops to the house of the LORD your God. And, like, don't cook a baby goat in her own milk or something. 27. Yo, Moses, listen up! The big man upstairs, the LORD, He's telling you to jot down these words. It's legit, 'cause based on these words, He's making a solid pact with you and all of Israel. 28. So, like, he literally kicked it with the LORD for, like, a solid 40 days and 40 nights without even munching on any bread or chugging water. And get this, he actually wrote down on these tables the legit words of the covenant, you know, like the ten commandments. #NoFilter 29. So, like, when Moses came down from this mountain called Sinai, he had these two tablets in his hand. And, you know, he didn't even realize that his face was glowing! He was just casually chatting with this guy up there and bam, shiny face! 30. So, when Aaron and all the fam of Israel peeped Moses, straight up, his face was glowing and they were lowkey scared to come near him. 31. So Moses was like, 'Hey, come here!' And Aaron and all the big shots of the crew came back to him. Then Moses had a chill convo with them. 32. And then all the Israelites rolled up, and God gave them instructions about everything he had said to Moses on Mount Sinai. 33. And once Moses finished talking to them, he covered his face with a veil. 34. But when Moses walked into the presence of the LORD to have a chat with him, he removed the veil from his face until he left. And when he came out, he shared with the children of Israel exactly what he was told to say. 35. So the people of Israel noticed that Moses' face was glowing, like super radiant and all. And Moses covered his face with a veil again, until he went inside to chat with God or something. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 341. And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon {these} tables the words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest. 2. And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. 3. And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. 4. And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. 5. And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. 6. And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, 7. Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear {the guilty}; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth {generation}. 8. And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped. 9. And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us; for it {is} a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance. 10. And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou {art} shall see the work of the LORD: for it {is} a terrible thing that I will do with thee. 11. Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 12. Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: 13. But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves: {images: Heb. statues} 14. For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name {is} Jealous, {is} a jealous God: 15. Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and {one} call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 16. And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. 17. Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. 18. The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 19. All that openeth the matrix {is} mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, {whether} ox or sheep, {that is male}. {sheep: or, kid} 20. But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem {him} not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. {lamb: or, kid} 21. Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. 22. And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end. {year's end: Heb. revolution of the year} 23. Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. 24. For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year. 25. Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 26. The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. 27. And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. 28. And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. {commandments: Heb. words} 29. And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. 30. And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 31. And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. 32. And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 33. And {till} Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. 34. But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel {that} which he was commanded. 35. And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 351. So Moses got everyone from Team Israel together and was like, 'Yo, listen up, these are the instructions straight from the Big Guy upstairs that y'all gotta follow.' 2. Yo, listen up! So, for six days straight, y'all gotta hustle and get that work done. But on the seventh day, it's time to chill and have a totally sacred, restful day for the LORD. Anyone who tries to do work on that day? Well, they're in for some serious consequences, ya dig? It's all about that holiness, fam! 3. Don't start any fires in your crib on the Sabbath, fam. 4. So Moses gathered all the Israelite peeps and was like, yo, listen up! God told me something important, here's what He said. 5. Yo, fam, bring an offering to the LORD. Whoever's down and willing, bring some lit gifts for the LORD - gold, silver, and brass, you know? 6.

The tent setup, including the covering, hooks, siding, support beams, bars, pillars, and bases, 12. The ark, and its poles, along with the mercy seat, and the curtain that covers it, 13. Like, there's this table with its sticks and all its stuff, including the shewbread, and everything, you know? 14.

The stuff that surrounds the court, like the poles and bases, and the hanging for the entrance of the court, 18. The stakes of the tabernacle, and the stakes of the court, and their cords, 19. The dope outfits for Aaron the priest and his squad to rock while doing their holy duties in the sacred spot. 20. And like, all the fam of the Israel peeps bounced outta Moses' vibe. 21. And everyone who felt inspired and had the motivation came forward, bringing their offerings to the work of the sacred gathering place, and for all the tasks and the special outfits. 22. So, like, all the guys and girls who were totally down for it came and brought all these cool gold accessories - bracelets, earrings, rings, and even these tablets - like fancy jewelry stuff, you know? And everyone who donated, they were all about that gold, giving it as an offering to the LORD. 23. And like, everyone who had these sick items - like blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair, red skins of rams, and badgers' skins - they totally brought them, dude. 24. Everyone who gave an offering of cash and metal brought it to the Lord, and anyone who had some shittim wood for any task also brought it. 25. And all the women who were skilled used their hands to spin and brought what they had spun, both blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linen. 26. And all the women who felt inspired and wise, skillfully crafted garments using goats' hair. 27. And the rulers flexed with some fresh onyx stones, and stones for that drip-worthy ephod and lit breastplate; 28. And like, dude, we gotta have all these sick spices and oils for the light and the anointing oil and the super fragrant incense, no cap! 29. The Israelite squad showed up with some major dedication and brought an offering to the LORD. Everyone, no matter their gender, brought their A-game and willingly contributed to all kinds of tasks that the LORD had commanded Moses to do. 30. Yo, Moses was like, 'Listen up, fam! The Lord just straight-up called out this dude named Bezaleel, son of Uri, son of Hur, repping the tribe of Judah! 31. And like, he totally filled him up with the Spirit of God, you know? Gave him mad wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and smarts to do all sorts of epic stuff! 32. And to create dope art, like using gold, silver, and brass. 33. And like, when it comes to using stones, you gotta totally make them fit and, you know, like, carving wood to create some super cool and intricate stuff. 34. And God has given him the desire to be a teacher, both him and Aholiab, the dude from the tribe of Dan, son of Ahisamach. 35. He has given them mad skills in all sorts of crafts, like engraving, craftsmanship, embroidery in all those fancy colors, and even weaving. They're basically experts at making cool stuff. \n",

The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses. 30. And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; 31. And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 32. And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 33. And in the cutting of stones, to set {them}, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work. 34. And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, {both} he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 35. Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, {even} of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work. \n",
      "Gen Z: Exodus 361. Then Bezaleel and Aholiab, along with all the super skilled peeps who had great wisdom and understanding, thanks to the LORD blessing them, knew exactly how to do all kinds of work for the sanctuary, following every single command that the LORD gave. 2. So Moses reached out to Bezaleel, Aholiab, and all the skilled folks out there whose hearts were filled with God-given wisdom. These were the ones who felt that inner motivation to step up and get to work on their tasks. 3. So, like, the peeps got all the stuff that the Israelites brought to Moses for the work in the sacred place, you know? They even kept adding more and more lit contributions every morning. 4. And all the super talented artists, who created all the cool stuff for the holy place, took a break from their hustle to admire what they had made; 5. And they were like, yo Moses, listen up. The people are donating way too much for the work the LORD told us to do. It's lit! 🙌 6. So Moses was like, 'Yo, listen up everyone!' He made it loud and clear to all the peeps in the camp that they gotta stop with all the work for the sanctuary offering. And you know what? They actually listened and stopped bringing stuff. 7. They had enough stuff to do the work and then some. 8. And all the smart guys who were working on the tabernacle made ten curtains out of fancy woven linen, decorated with cool blue, purple, and red colors, and cleverly designed cherubim. 9. One curtain was like 28 cubits long and 4 cubits wide, and all the curtains were the same size. 10. Then he like, connected the five curtains together, and connected the other five curtains together too. 11. Then he put some cool blue loops on the edge of one curtain, starting from the cool edge of the fabric. He did the same thing on the other side of another curtain, at the connecting point of the second curtain. (Psst, 'selvedge' means an edge of cloth that won't unravel.) 12. He put fifty loops on one curtain, and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was next to it. These loops kept the curtains together. 13. And he hooked up fifty golden fasteners, connecting the curtains together with these fasteners, making it into a single tabernacle. 14. And he like, totally hooked up some dope curtains for the tent over the tabernacle, made 'em out of goats' hair. He had eleven curtains in total, man. Such craftsmanship, I'm telling you! 15. Each curtain was, like, 30 cubits long and 4 cubits wide, ya know? And all the eleven curtains were like totally the same size. 16. So, he like, joined five curtains all together, and then six curtains all together, you know. 17. Then he attached fifty loops to the outer edge of the curtain, and he attached fifty loops to the edge of the curtain that joins the second one. 18. And he slapped together fifty shiny metal thingies to connect the tent, so it would all stay put and be one solid unit. 19. So he flexed with a sick tent cover made of red-dyed rams' skins, and topped it off with an extra fly badgers' skins layer. 😎 20. And he crafted some epic boards for the tabernacle out of shittim wood, standing up like bosses. 21. The board was, like, 10 cubits long and, you know, one and a half cubits wide. 22. Each board had two tenons, evenly spaced apart, just like he made for all the boards of the tabernacle. 23. And he built some sick planks for the tabernacle; like, twenty of them for the south side, you know, toward the south: 24. And he made forty silver sockets underneath the twenty boards; two sockets under each board for the tenons, and two sockets under another board for the tenons. 25. And for the other side of the tabernacle, like, the part that's facing the north corner, he made twenty boards, lol. 26. And they had these forty silver thingies; two thingies under each board, and two thingies under another board. 27. And for the sides of the tabernacle facing the sunset, he crafted six boards. 28. And he made two sick boards for the corners of the swag crib on both sides. 29. And they were like totally linked together underneath, and they were like connected at the top with this rad ring: so both of them were styled like that wickedly in both corners. {coupled: Hebrew twinned} 30. So there were like eight boards, and they had these like sixteen silver sockets. Each board had two sockets underneath. You know, two sockets stacked up under one board. 31. Then he crafted sturdy bars using shittim wood, five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle. 32. And there were like five sick bars on each side of the chill tabernacle, and another five sick bars on the west side of the tabernacle walls. 33. And he created this super cool metal rod that went straight through the boards from one side to the other, like a boss. 34. Then he flexed those boards with some mad gold, and crafted solid gold rings as holders for the bars. And yeah, he totally covered the bars with more gold, straight up blinging the whole setup. 35. And he crafted a cool-looking curtain using blue, purple, scarlet, and fancy linen. He even added some cleverly designed cherubim to make it extra special. 36. And he used four lit pillars made of shittim wood, and covered them in gold: their hooks were made of gold; and he molded four silver sockets for them. 37. Then he created a sick hanging for the entrance of the crib with dope blue, lit purple, fire red, and top-grade woven fabric, all skillfully embroidered. 38. And the five support structures were equipped with hooks, and their tops and bands were covered in gold, while their bases were made of brass. \n",

Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded. 2. And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, {even} every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 3. And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it {withal}. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning. 4. And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made; 5. And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make. 6. And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. 7. For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much. 8. And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains {of} fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: {with} cherubims of cunning work made he them. 9.

And he made fifty taches {of} brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. 19. And he made a covering for the tent {of} rams' skins dyed red, and a covering {of} badgers' skins above {that}. 20. And he made boards for the tabernacle {of} shittim wood, standing up. 21. The length of a board {was} ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half. 22. One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 23.

And they hammered the gold into super thin metal sheets, and then made wires out of it, so they could use it to make cool stuff with blue, purple, scarlet, and fancy linen, with some really talented craftsmanship. 4. They added cool shoulder accessories to it, to connect it together - it was connected at the two edges. 5. And the cool belt of his fancy robe, that was on it, was made of the same, just like it was designed; made of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine woven fabric; exactly as the LORD told Moses. 6. And they crafted cool onyx stones enclosed in gold holders, engraved just like trendy personalized rings, with the names of the children of Israel. 7. And he like, totally placed those beauties on the shoulders of the ephod, you know, those stones that were a total reminder for the children of Israel, just like the LORD told Moses to do. So lit! 8. And he crafted the breastplate with mad skills, just as he did with the ephod; made of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fancy linen braided together. 9. The breastplate was like a perfect square, they made it two layers thick. It was a span in length and a span in width, doubled up. 10. And they put on it four rows of stones: the first row had a ruby, a topaz, and a garnet: this was the first row. (ruby: or, sardius) 11. And for the second line, there's an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. 12. And in the third row, there's like this dope ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. They're all super rad, fam. 13.

There were twelve stones, each one representing a tribe. They were engraved like fancy rings with the names of each tribe on them. 15. And they put chains made of intricately woven pure gold on the edges of the breastplate. 16. And they flexed with two gold chains and put two gold rings on them; and attached the rings to the ends of the drip. 17. And they hooked up the two gold chains onto the two rings at the ends of the blingin' breastplate. 18. They attached the two ends of the chains to the two fancy pendants and put them on the shoulder pads of the ephod, right up front. 19. Then they made two dope gold rings and put them on the ends of the lit breastplate, right on the edge, towards the inside of the ephod. 20. Then they made two more lit golden rings and attached them to the sides of the ephod, towards the front, right across from the other attachment. These rings were positioned above the fancy belt of the ephod. 21. So they connected the breastplate to the ephod using blue laces and rings, making sure it stayed in place above the fancy belt of the ephod. They made sure the breastplate didn't come off the ephod, just like the LORD told Moses. 22. And he, like, totally crafted this super cool robe for the ephod using, like, intricate woven techniques and it was all decked out in this awesome shade of blue. 23. And there was, like, a sick cutout in the middle of the robe, just like the cutout on cool armor, with a cool band wrapped around it, so it wouldn't even tear, you know? 24. And they put some super cool pomegranates with awesome colors like blue, purple, and scarlet, and they twisted some linen around them on the edges of the robe. 25. They crafted some sick golden bells and put them along with the pomegranates on the edge of the robe, all the way around between the pomegranates. 26. Yo, there were these cool bells and pomegranates all around the hem of the robe to represent the minister's role, just like how the LORD told Moses to do it. 27. And they made these really dope coats for Aaron and his homies, out of top-notch linen material. The craftsmanship was on point, with some sick woven designs, you feel me? 28. Also, there was this really sleek mitre made of top-notch linen, and these super stylish bonnets also made of fancy linen, and some seriously trendy linen breeches made of fine twined linen. 29.

So, they took this really sick gold plate and wrote on it, like, some super cool engraving, saying 'HOLINESS TO THE LORD'. 31. So they attached a blue ribbon to hold it securely on top of the hat, just like God told Moses. 32. So, like, they finally finished building the tabernacle, you know, that tent where everyone gathered. And guess what? The Israelites totally followed all the instructions that the LORD gave to Moses. They didn't even miss a beat! That's how they rolled. 33. So they took the tabernacle over to Moses, that cool tent with all its stuff like hooks, planks, bars, pillars, and sockets. 34. Yo, there were these sick skins from rams which were dyed red, and also these dope skins from badgers, not to mention the super rad veil for the cover. 35.

      "KJV: Exodus 391. And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to do service in the holy {place}, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses. 2. And he made the ephod {of} gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 3. And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut {it into} wires, to work {it} in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, {with} cunning work. 4. They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple {it} together: by the two edges was it coupled together. 5. And the curious girdle of his ephod, that {was} upon it, {was} of the same, according to the work thereof; {of} gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses. 6. And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. 7. And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, {that they should be} stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses. 8. And he made the breastplate {of} cunning work, like the work of the ephod; {of} gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 9. It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span {was} the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, {being} doubled. 10. And they set in it four rows of stones: {the first} row {was} a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this {was} the first row. {sardius: or, ruby} 11. And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. 12. And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. 13.

And the stones {were} according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names, {like} the engravings of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes. 15. And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, {of} wreathen work {of} pure gold. 16. And they made two ouches {of} gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. 17. And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastplate. 18. And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it. 19. And they made two rings of gold, and put {them} on the two ends of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which {was} on the side of the ephod inward. 20. And they made two {other} golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the {other} coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. 21. And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses. 22. And he made the robe of the ephod {of} woven work, all {of} blue. 23. And {there was} an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of an habergeon, {with} a band round about the hole, that it should not rend. 24. And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates {of} blue, and purple, and scarlet, {and} twined {linen}. 25. And they made bells {of} pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates; 26. A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister {in}; as the LORD commanded Moses. 27. And they made coats {of} fine linen {of} woven work for Aaron, and for his sons, 28. And a mitre {of} fine linen, and goodly bonnets {of} fine linen, and linen breeches {of} fine twined linen, 29. And a girdle {of} fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, {of} needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses. 30.

And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten {it} on high upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses. 32. Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they. 33. And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets, 34.

      "Gen Z: Exodus 401. God was like, 'Yo, Moses, I got something to say...' 2. Yo, on the first day of the first month, you gotta get that tabernacle of the tent of the congregation all set up. 3. And you gotta place in there the awesome ark of the testimony, and like, totally cover it up with the cool veil. Whoa. 4. Yo, bring in the table and arrange all the necessary stuff on it. Then, bring in the candlestick and light up those lamps. 5. And you gotta place the sick altar made of gold for the incense right in front of the ark, and hang up the door curtain for the tabernacle. 6. And you gotta place the altar of the burnt offering right outside the entrance of the tabernacle, where all the peeps gather. 7. And you gotta place the fancy sink thingy in the middle of the meeting spot and the altar, and fill it up with water. 8. And you will create a sick outdoor space, surrounding it with a dope fence and adding an epic entrance curtain at the gate. 9. Yo, grab the anointing oil and put it on the tabernacle and everything inside, making it all holy and sacred. 10. And you gotta put oil on the burnt offering altar and all the stuff that goes with it, and make the altar super holy. Like, it's gonna be the holiest of the holy altars, you know? 11. And you gotta put oil on the sink and its base, and make it holy. 12. So, basically, you gotta take Aaron and his squad to the entrance of the sacred hangout spot, and give them a good cleanse with some water. 13. And you gotta dress Aaron up in those sick holy threads, and give him a sick anointing and blessing, so he can do his thing as my main homie in the priest job. 14. And you'll bring his sons and give them some sick threads: 15. And like, you gotta like, totally pour oil on them just like you did for their dad, so they can serve me as priests and stuff. 'Cause this whole anointing thing is gonna last forever and keep going down the family line, ya know? 16. And Moses was like, totally on point. He did everything just as the LORD told him to. 17. So, like, in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, they totally set up the tabernacle, you know? 18. So Moses bougie-ly set up the tabernacle, secured its sockets, assembled the boards, inserted the bars, and stood up the pillars like a boss. 19. Then he like, set up the tent thingy over the special tabernacle, and threw this cool cover on top of it, just like the Lord had told Moses to do. 20. Then he took the testimony and placed it inside the ark. He positioned the poles on the ark and placed the mercy seat on top of it. 21. So, like, he totally carried the ark into the tabernacle, and put up this cool curtain thingy to cover it and protect it, just as the LORD told Moses to do. So obedient, man. 22. And he set up the table inside the gathering spot, on the north side of the special tent, uncovered. 23. And he arranged the bread just how the LORD told Moses, all proper and stuff. 24. And he placed the lit lamp thingy inside the gathering tent, right across from the table, on the southern side of the portable churchy housing thingy. 25. And he turned on the lit AF lamps in front of the LORD, just like Moses was told to do by the LORD. 26. And he placed the sick golden altar in the epic tent of the squad gathering just right before the dope curtain:  27. And he burned some dope incense on it, just like the LORD told Moses. 28. And he hung the sick drapes by the entrance of the chill tabernacle. 29. Then he placed the burnt offering altar right by the entrance of the tabernacle where everyone gathered, and followed God's command by offering both the burnt offering and the meat offering on it, just as Moses was told. 30. And he placed the basin between the hangout spot and the big sacred BBQ grill, and filled it up with water for cleansing purposes. 31. So Moses, Aaron, and their squad decided to clean their hands and feet like a boss: 32. When they slid up into the tent to hang out, and when they got close to the chill altar, they rinsed off, just like Moses had been told by the LORD. 33. And Moses built the area around the tent and the altar, and hung a curtain for the entrance. So Moses completed the whole project. 34. So, like, this cloud totally rolled in and covered the whole tent where everyone was hanging out, you know? And, whoa, it was like this epic display of God's awesomeness, filling up the tabernacle with His glory. So legit! 35. So Moses couldn't even get into the hangout spot, 'cause this awesome cloud was all up in there, and God's glorious presence was straight up filling the place. 36. And once the cloud bounced from over the chill pad, the squad of Israel kept it movin' on all their trips: {kept it movin': Hebrew, journeyed} 37. But yo, if that cloud ain't bouncing, they ain't moving until that day it gets lifted. 38. Yo, the LORD's swaggy cloud was straight up chillin' on the tabernacle in the daytime, and at night it was lit up with fire, so everyone in Israel could see it on all their trips. \n",
      "KJV: Exodus 401. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 3. And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark with the vail. 4. And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof. {the things...: Heb. the order thereof} 5. And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. 6. And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 7. And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein. 8. And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at the court gate. 9. And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that {is} therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy. 10. And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. {most holy: Heb. holiness of holinesses} 11. And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. 12. And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water. 13. And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest's office. 14. And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 15. And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. 16. Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did he. 17. And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first {day} of the month, {that} the tabernacle was reared up. 18. And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. 19. And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses. 20. And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 21. And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses. 22. And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail. 23. And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had commanded Moses. 24. And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 25. And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 26. And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the vail: 27. And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses. 28. And he set up the hanging {at} the door of the tabernacle. 29. And he put the altar of burnt offering {by} the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses. 30. And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash {withal}. 31. And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat: 32. When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses. 33. And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work. 34. Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 35. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 36. And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: {went onward: Heb. journeyed} 37. But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. 38. For the cloud of the LORD {was} upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 11. So like, God hit up Moses and started talking to him from the tabernacle, you know what I'm saying? 2. Yo, listen up, all you peeps from Israel!

But he should totally rinse the insides and the legs with water, and then the priest would bring it all and roast it on the altar. It's like a lit sacrifice, a fire offering that smells super good to the LORD. 14. And if the lit sacrifice he's offering to the LORD is like from birds, then he's gotta bring his offering of turtledoves or young pigeons. 15. The priest gotta take it to the altar, chop off its head, and burn it up on the altar. Then the blood gotta be squeezed out on the side of the altar. #sacrificialvibes 16.

      "Gen Z: Leviticus 21. Yo, when someone wants to make a lit offering to the Lord, they gotta come through with that fine flour.

Then he's gonna give it to Aaron's sons, the priests, and they'll take a handful of the flour and oil mixed with all that awesome frankincense.

When it comes to giving the firstfruits as an offering, you should present them to the LORD. However, they shouldn't be burned on the altar to create a pleasing aroma. 13. Yo, make sure you sprinkle some salt on every meat offering you bring. Don't forget to include that salt of the covenant of your God in your meat offering. And hey, whenever you bring an offering, always remember to add some salt to it. 14. And like, if you wanna give an offering of your firstfruits to the LORD, you gotta offer some fresh corn that's been dried by fire, ya know? Just the good parts from those corn ears should be used. 15. And you gotta drizzle some oil on it, and sprinkle some frankincense on top, like a legit offering, you know. 16.

      "Gen Z: Leviticus 41. Yo, God hit up Moses and was like, 2. Yo, listen up, Israelites! So, like, if someone unintentionally messes up and breaks any of God's commandments, doing something they shouldn't do, 3. If the priest, who is anointed, messes up like the rest of us, then he needs to offer a perfect young bull as a sin offering to make things right with the LORD. 4. Then he's gotta take the bull to the entrance of the hangout spot where God's peeps gather. He'll put his hand on the bull's head and take it down in front of the Lord. 5.

Then the priest will dab his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times in front of the LORD, right by the curtain of the sacred place. 7. Then the priest will take some of the blood and put it on the corners of the special altar in front of the LORD, which is inside the sacred tent. He will pour all the blood of the bull at the base of the big altar where they burn sacrifices, which is located right by the entrance of the sacred tent. 8. And he's gonna like, totally remove all the fat from the bull for the sin offering. You know, the fat that's like covering the insides, and all the fat that's on the insides. Can't have any of that fat, dude! 9. And like, you gotta totally take those two kidneys and the fat that's on them, ya know, the one by the flanks and that caul thingy above the liver. And dudette, don't forget to remove the kidneys along with all that stuff! 10. Just like when you separate the good stuff from the bull offered as a peaceful sacrifice, the priest's gonna burn it up on the super hot altar for burnt offerings. 11. And, like, the whole skin and body of the bull, including its head, legs, insides, and poop, 12. He's gotta take the whole bull outside the camp to a clean spot where they dump the ashes, and burn it up on some wood with fire. Gotta make sure it's burned up at that ash dumping spot. 13. And yo, if the whole squad of Israel messes up by accident and the crew ain't even aware of it, and they've gone and done something against one of the LORD's commandments that shouldn't be done, and they're guilty; 14. So, like, if someone messes up big time and everyone finds out about it, the whole squad needs to bring a young bull to the hangout spot outside the meeting place, as an apology for the messed up thing they did. 15. The older guys in the group are gonna place their hands on the bull's head in front of the LORD, and then they're gonna off the bull right there in front of the LORD. 16.

The priest is gonna make things right for them, and they'll be forgiven. 21. And he's gotta take the bull outside the hangout spot, and roast it just like he roasted the first bull, 'cause it's a sacrifice to make up for the crew's sins. 22. If a leader messes up and accidentally breaks any of God's commandments by doing something wrong that they didn't know about, and becomes guilty; 23. If he realizes he has sinned, he should bring a perfect male goat as his offering. 24. He's gonna put his hand on the goat's head and take it out in the same spot where they do the burnt offering for the LORD. It's like a sacrifice for sin and stuff. 25. Then the priest will take some of the blood from the sin offering and dab it on the corners of the big altar, and pour the rest of the blood at the base of the big altar. 26.

If someone realizes they have sinned, they need to bring a flawless female goat as an offering to make up for their wrongdoing. 29. Then he'll put his hand on the head of the sin offering and take care of it right there, instead of the burnt offering. 30. Then the priest will dab some of the blood with his finger and dab it on the corners of the sacrifice altar and pour out all the blood at the base of the altar. 31. And like, the priest gotta remove all the fat from it, just like how fat is removed from a peace offering sacrifice, you know? And then the priest gotta burn it on the altar, and it's all for that sweet aroma that the LORD loves, man. It's like a way for the priest to make things right for the person and get their forgiveness. 32. And if he brings a lamb for a sin offering, he's gotta bring a flawless female one. 33. And he's gonna place his hand on the head of the sin offering and, like, kill it as a sin offering where they do the same for the burnt offering. 34. And the priest will take some of the blood from the sin offering and dab it on the edges of the lit altar, and then pour out all the blood at the base of the altar: 35. And he's gotta remove all the fat, like how you take out the fat from the lamb sacrifice for peace offerings. Then the priest has to burn them on the altar, just like the fire offerings to the LORD.

      "Gen Z: Leviticus 51. If someone messes up and hears somebody swearing, and they're a witness, whether they saw it or knew about it; if they don't speak up, then they will be responsible for their own mistake. 2. If someone comes into contact with something unclean, like a dead unclean animal or a dead unclean bug, and they didn't even realize it, they will also become unclean and at fault. 3. If he gets involved with something that makes a person unclean, like any kind of uncleanness, and he doesn't realize it, but later finds out, then he's in the wrong. 4. If someone makes a promise, swearing to do something bad or good, whatever it is that they promise with an oath, even if they forget about it, once they realize what they promised, they'll be considered guilty for breaking it. 5. When somebody messes up in any of these situations, they gotta own up and admit that they screwed up: 6. So this dude needs to bring his apology gift to the big man upstairs for the wrong things he did. It's gotta be a female sheep or baby goat, like a lamb or a kid of the goats, as a way to say sorry. And the priest will take care of all the forgiveness stuff for him. 7. And if he can't afford to bring a lamb, then he should bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons as a way to make up for his wrongdoings before the LORD. One bird will be a sacrifice for his sins, and the other one will be entirely burnt as an offering. 8. Then he'll take them to the priest, who will offer the sin offering first and twist off its head without tearing it apart: 9. And he's gonna like, sprinkle some of that sin offering blood on the side of the altar. And the rest of the blood is gonna be, like, squeezed out at the bottom, you know? It's like, totally a sin offering. 10. And he should offer the second one as a burn sacrifice, following the usual way. The priest will then make things right for him, making up for the sin he committed, and he will be forgiven. (manner: or, ordinance) 11. But if he can't bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then the person who sinned should offer one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering. They shouldn't put any oil or frankincense on it, because it's for a sin offering. 12. Then you gotta take that thing to the priest, and the priest is gonna take a lil' handful of it, as a reminder, and burn it up on the altar, just like the other offerings that are set on fire for the LORD. Yeah, it's like a way of saying sorry for messing up or doing something wrong. 13. The priest will help him make things right for the sin he messed up with, and he'll be forgiven. The rest of the stuff belongs to the priest, like a snack. 14. God texted Moses, like, 15. If someone accidentally does something wrong and sins without realizing it in the sacred things belonging to the LORD, they should bring a perfect ram from their flock as a way to make amends, valuing it in silver coins based on the standard weight of the sanctuary, as a way to compensate for their mistake. 16. If someone messes up with something sacred, they gotta make it right. They gotta pay an extra 20% and give it to the priest. The priest will fix things up with a special sacrifice and then it's all good, forgiven! 17. So, like, if someone messes up and does any of the stuff that the Lord says not to do, even if they didn't realize it, they still messed up and gotta own up to it. 18. He has to grab a flawless ram from his squad, valued as a trespass offering, and take it to the priest. The priest will make things right for him when he messes up unknowingly and doesn't have a clue, and he'll be forgiven. 19. Yo, this a straight-up apology gift.

Or if you find something that was lost and lie about it or swear falsely—any of these actions is a sinful thing to do. 4. If someone messes up and does something wrong, causing harm or taking something by force or trickery, or if they were entrusted with something to keep and it got lost, they gotta make it right and give it back. 5. If someone lies about something they swore to, they have to give it back and add an extra twenty percent.

And the priest, like, totally fixes things up for him in front of the LORD, and bam! It's forgiven, dude! Everything he messed up and did wrong in that situation, he's in the clear now. 8. Yo, God was like, Mosess, check this out' 9. Yo, Aaron and his squad gotta follow this rule: When it comes to the burnt offering, it's all about keeping that fire burning on the altar all night until morning. That fire gotta stay lit, ya feel me? 10. The priest gotta get dressed in his linen outfit, including linen pants. Then he gotta scoop up the ashes from the burnt offering on the altar and put 'em next to the altar. 11. Then he has to change his clothes, put on different ones, and take the ashes outside the camp to a spot that's clean. 12. The fire on the altar gotta keep burnin' nonstop, can't let it die out. The priest's gotta throw some wood on it every morning and arrange the burnt offering on top. Then he's gotta burn that fat from the peace offerings on there. 13. The flame on the altar gotta stay lit 24/7, no extinguishing allowed. 14. So, like, this is the rule for the meat offering, okay? The sons of Aaron gotta offer it to the Lord, right in front of the altar. 15. And he's gonna take some of that flour, oil, and frankincense from the meat offering and burn it on the altar. It's gonna be a dope smell that reminds everyone of the Lord. 16. Aaron and his homies gotta chow down on the leftovers: grab some unleavened bread and feast in the sacred spot, right in the court of the tabernacle where everyone gathers. 17. Don't even think about adding any leaven to it. I've designated it as their special share of my fire offerings, and it's super sacred, just like the sin offering and the trespass offering. 18. All the guys from Aaron's fam gotta grub on this. It's a forever rule for your fam to follow when it comes to the lit offerings for the LORD, cooked by fire. And whoever messes with 'em gotta stay holy. 19. Then God spoke to Moses, like, 20. Yo, peep this offering from Aaron and his homies, that they gotta bring to the LORD on the day he's anointed. It's like a tenth of an ephah of high-quality flour, always a solid meat offering. Split it up, half in the morning and the other half at night. 21. You gotta use oil when cookin' it in a pan. After it's baked, bring it in. Then, offer the baked pieces of the meat as a delicious smellin' offering to the LORD. 22. And the TikTok-famous priest who takes over for his dad will be the one to offer it: tiktok it's a forever rule for the Lord; like, it's gotta be completely roasted. 23. Like, all the food offerings for the priest gotta be totally burnt, dude. No munching on them, okay? 24. God was like, 'Yo, Moses, listen up,' 25. Yo, Aaron and his squad, listen up. This is the deal with the sin offering: You gotta kill it where you usually do the burnt offering, in front of the LORD. Trust me, it's super sacred. 26. The priest who sacrifices it for sin gets to chow down on it: it gets eaten in the holy spot, specifically in the tabernacle courtyard. 27. Anything that comes into contact with it must be considered sacred. And if any of its blood splatters onto clothing, you must wash those garments in a special area designated for sacred rituals. 28. But the pot you use for cooking must be shattered if it's made of clay, and if it's made of bronze, it must be scrubbed and washed with water. 29. All the dudes who are priests get to chow down on it: super sacred vibes, bro. 30. And you can't eat any sin offering that has its blood brought into the tabernacle to make things right in the holy place. It has to be burnt up in the fire instead. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 61. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; {in fellowship: or, in dealing} {fellowship: Heb. putting of the hand} 3. Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 4. Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found, 5. Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, {and} give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering. {in the day...: or, in the day of his being found guilty: Heb. in the day of his trespass} 6. And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: 7. And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing therein. 8. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 9. Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This {is} the law of the burnt offering: It {is} the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it. {because...: or, for the burning} 10. And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar. 11. And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. 12. And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings. 13. The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out. 14. And this {is} the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar. 15. And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which {is} upon the meat offering, and shall burn {it} upon the altar {for} a sweet savour, {even} the memorial of it, unto the LORD. 16. And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it. 17. It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it {unto them for} their portion of my offerings made by fire; it {is} most holy, as {is} the sin offering, and as the trespass offering. 18. All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. {It shall be} a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy. 19. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20. This {is} the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night. 21. In a pan it shall be made with oil; {and when it is} baken, thou shalt bring it in: {and} the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou offer {for} a sweet savour unto the LORD. 22. And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: {it is} a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly burnt. 23. For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten. 24. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 25. Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This {is} the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it {is} most holy. 26. The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation. 27. Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place. 28. But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water. 29. All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it {is} most holy. 30. And no sin offering, whereof {any} of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile {withal} in the holy {place}, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 71. So basically, this is the deal with the trespass offering: it's like super sacred and pure, you know. 2. In the spot where they do the sacrifice for the burnt offering, that's where they'll handle the trespass offering too. Sprinkle the blood all around the altar. 3. And he's gonna give up all that juicy fat; the thicc booty and the fat covering the guts, 4. And like, you gotta remove the two kidneys and that juicy fat surrounding them, ya know, by the flanks. And also the caul thingy above the liver, along with the kidneys, he's gotta take 'em away, man. 5. And the priest gotta yeet them onto the altar, a lit sacrifice for the LORD. It's like a way of saying sorry for messing up. 6. All the dudes who are priests gotta eat that stuff, and they gotta chow down on it in the special holy spot, 'cause it's like super duper holy, you know? 7. The sin offering and the trespass offering are like two peas in a pod, yo. They gotta follow the same rules and regulations, no exceptions. Only the priest who performs the atonement with it is legit. 8. And the priest who presents someone's burnt offering gets to keep the skin of the offering for himself. 9. All the lit snacks that are baked or fried in the stove and pan belong to the priest who offers them. (Alternative: on the fancy plate or as a slice) 10. And the sons of Aaron shall each receive an equal share of every meat offering that is mixed with oil and is dry. 11. So, like, this is the deal with the peace offerings, fam. It's all about this law that says you gotta offer it up to the big man upstairs, the LORD. 12. If he wants to give thanks, then he should bring some lit unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and some anointed unleavened wafers with oil, and some epic fried cakes made with fine flour. 13. And on top of the usual cakes, he's gotta bring some fresh bread along with his thanksgiving offering and peace offerings. 14. And from that, the priest should take one as a special offering to the LORD. It will belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings. 15. And like, the meat of the peace offering he's given as a gratitude thing, it's got to be eaten on the same day it's brought, you know? Don't save any of it for later, bro, finish it up before morning. 16. But if the sacrifice he gives is a vow or a freewill offering, he should chow it down on the same day he gives it, and whatever's left should be devoured the next day too: 17. But on the third day, you gotta burn up the rest of that sacrifice meat with fire. 18. And yo, if anyone eats any of the meat from their peace offerings on the third day, it's a major no-go. It won't count as an acceptable offering, and the person who eats it will be totally guilty for their wrongdoing. It's like a straight-up abomination, fam. 19. If you come into contact with anything dirty, don't eat the meat. Burn it up! But if the meat is clean, go ahead and dig in, fam! 20. But if someone eats the meat from the peace offerings that is dedicated to the LORD, while they are unclean, they will be separated from their community. 21. And if someone touches something impure, whether it's something impure from a person, an impure animal, or something disgusting and impure, and then eats the meat from a peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that person will be separated from their community. 22. God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,' 23. Hey, listen up, all you peeps in Israel! I've got somethin' important to say. Don't chow down on any fatty goodness from those beef, lamb, or goat dishes of yours, ya hear? 24. Yo, you know that fat from an animal that kicks the bucket on its own or gets torn up by other beasts? Yeah, you can totally use that fat for anything else you want, but no way should you be munching on it. Stay away from that stuff, fam. #respecttheanimals 25. If anyone chows down on the fatty part of an animal offered as a fiery sacrifice to the LORD, they're totally getting booted from their crew. 26. Yo, don't be consuming any blood, whether it's from birds or animals, anywhere you live, alright? 27. If anyone eats any kind of blood, they'll be totally canceled from their clique. 28. Yo, the LORD was like talking to Moses, and He was all like, 29. Yo, listen up, Israel fam! If you wanna offer some peace offerings to the big man upstairs, make sure you bring them right to the Lord as an oblation. Show some love for those peace offerings, y'all! 30. He himself will bring the lit offerings to the LORD, including the fat and the meat. He'll bring it all, so that the meat can be waved as an offering to the LORD. 31. The priest's gotta grill up that fat on the altar, but the juicy breast meat belongs to Aaron and his crew. 32. And you gotta give the priest the right shoulder as a hella rad offering from the sacrifices you bring to show your chill vibes. 33. The dude from Aaron's squad who's in charge of offering up the blood and fat for the peace offerings gets to keep the right shoulder as their share. 34. So, like, I've totally claimed the wave breast and heave shoulder from the Israelites' peace offerings, ya know? And forever, I've hooked Aaron the priest and his sons up with 'em as a solid rule for the fam. It's a gift that keeps on giving, bud, straight from the Israelite crew. 35. This is the deal where Aaron and his squad get anointed with some lit gifts from the Lord. It went down on the day they stepped up to serve the Lord, doing their priest duties, all official-like. 36. This is what the LORD said should be given to the children of Israel when they were anointed, and it should be a forever thing for all their future peeps. 37. This is the deal with the burnt offering, meat offering, sin offering, trespass offering, consecrations, and sacrifice of the peace offerings. 38. This is what God told Moses on Mount Sinai, when He commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to Him, while they were in the middle of the Sinai desert. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 71. Likewise this {is} the law of the trespass offering: it {is} most holy. 2. In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar. 3. And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, 4. And the two kidneys, and the fat that {is} on them, which {is} by the flanks, and the caul {that is} above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 5. And the priest shall burn them upon the altar {for} an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it {is} a trespass offering. 6. Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it {is} most holy. 7. As the sin offering {is}, so {is} the trespass offering: {there is} one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have {it}. 8. And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, {even} the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered. 9. And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it. {in the pan: or, on the flat plate or, slice} 10. And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one {as much} as another. 11. And this {is} the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD. 12. If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried. 13. Besides the cakes, he shall offer {for} his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings. 14. And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation {for} an heave offering unto the LORD, {and} it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings. 15. And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. 16. But if the sacrifice of his offering {be} a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten: 17. But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire. 18. And if {any} of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. 19. And the flesh that toucheth any unclean {thing} shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof. 20. But the soul that eateth {of} the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that {pertain} unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 21. Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean {thing, as} the uncleanness of man, or {any} unclean beast, or any abominable unclean {thing}, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which {pertain} unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 22. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 23. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat. 24. And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it. {beast...: Heb. carcase} 25. For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth {it} shall be cut off from his people. 26. Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, {whether it be} of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. 27. Whatsoever soul {it be} that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 28. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 29. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. 30. His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved {for} a wave offering before the LORD. 31. And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'. 32. And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest {for} an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. 33. He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for {his} part. 34. For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel. 35. This {is the portion} of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day {when} he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office; 36. Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, {by} a statute for ever throughout their generations. 37. This {is} the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 38. Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 81. And then the LORD was like, 'Yo, Moses, listen up,' 2. Yo, grab Aaron and his homies, their dope outfits, that blessed oil, a bull for the sin sacrifice, two rams, and a basket of bread without that yeast, ya feel? 3. Yo, round up all the squad and bring 'em to the entrance of the sacred hangout spot, yo. 4. So Moses followed God's instructions and the entire crowd assembled at the entrance of the tent where they gathered to worship. 5. And Moses was like, yo fam, listen up! This is the thing that the LORD straight up commanded us to do, you feel me? 6. So Moses gathered Aaron and his homies, and gave them a fresh wash. 7. Then he dressed him up in the coat, put on a trendy belt, dressed him up in the cool robe, and placed the ephod on him. And he rocked the stylish belt that went with the ephod, and secured it to him. 8. And he put the drip-worthy breastplate on him, and he slipped in the mad lit Urim and Thummim into the breastplate. 9. Then he put the cool hat on his head, and on the front of the hat he placed a shiny golden plate, the special crown, just like the LORD told Moses. 10. So, Moses grabbed the anointing oil and started putting it on the tabernacle and everything inside it, making it totally holy. 11. Then he dabbed some on the altar about seven times, and put oil on the altar and all its stuff, including the fancy sink and its stand, to make it all holy and stuff. 12. And he dripped some of that holy oil on Aaron's head, giving him a special blessing and making him super holy. 13. So Moses brought Aaron's sons and dressed them in fancy clothes, and put belts around them, and placed stylish hats on their heads, just as the LORD told Moses to do. 14. Then he brought the bullock for the sin offering, and Aaron and his squad placed their hands on the head of the bullock for the sin offering. 15. Then he killed the animal, and Moses took the blood and spread it all around the edges of the altar with his finger. He cleansed the altar and poured the blood at the base of it, making it holy and able to bring peace and forgiveness. 16. Then he gathered all the juicy stuff inside, like the fatty parts, the covering of the liver, the two kidneys, and their fat. Moses straight up burned it all on the altar. 17. So, like, that bull and everything - the whole deal, like its hide, flesh, and dung - it was totally burned up outside the camp, just like the LORD told Moses to do. 18. And he's like, yo, he brought the ram for that burnt offering, and Aaron and his squad placed their hands on the ram's head. 19. And he straight up yeeted that thing; and Moses sprinkled the blood all around the altar, like a boss. 20. Then he like, totally sliced up the ram, and Moses straight up burned the head, the chunks, and the fat. No waste, bro. 21. Then he washed the insides and the legs with water. And Moses burned the entire ram on the altar. It was like a lit sacrifice, pleasing to the LORD, just as the LORD told Moses to do. 22. Then he brought another ram, the special ram for consecration, and Aaron and his squad placed their hands on its head. 23. So he killed the animal, and Moses took some of its blood and placed it on the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 24. Then Moses brought Aaron's sons and put some blood on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. And Moses sprinkled the blood all around the altar. 25. Then he gathered all the fat, the juicy parts, and the stuff inside, along with the stuff on top of the liver, the two kidneys, and their fat, and even the right shoulder: 26. And from the basket of unleavened bread, that was right there in front of the LORD, he grabbed one plain bread, and a bread with oil, and a thin crispy bread, and placed them on the fat, and on the right shoulder: 27. And he gave everything to Aaron and his sons, and they waved them as an offering to the LORD. 28. Then Moses grabbed them from their hands and lit them up on the altar along with the burnt offering. Those were like special goodies that smelled really good to God. It's a fire gift for the Lord. 29. Then Moses took the juicy part of the ram and did a little wave action with it to present as an offering to the LORD. This was part of the special ram that Moses got, just like the LORD told him to do. 30. So Moses grabbed some of that anointing oil and blood from the altar, and he sprinkled it on Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes. Basically, he made them all holy and set apart for a special purpose. 31. Moses was like, 'Yo, Aaron and fam, you gotta cook up that meat right outside the holy meeting spot. Then you can chow down with the sacred bread from the special basket, just like I told you. Aaron and his sons gotta be the ones munching on it, no one else. 32. You gotta torch the leftover meat and bread, fam. Burn it up real good with fire. 33. And like, you can't leave the tabernacle hangout for a whole week until your consecration is over, man. It's like a sacred time, bro. You gotta stay put for seven days straight, 'cause that's how long it takes to get you all consecrated and stuff. 34. Just like the Lord said, he did it today to make things right for you. 35. So basically, you gotta hang out by the entrance of the tent where everyone gathers. Do this day and night for a whole week and make sure you follow all the rules God gave ya. It's super important, otherwise you might end up in big trouble. God made it clear, so just do it! 36. So Aaron and his squad totally did everything the LORD told them to do through Moses. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 81. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread; 3. And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 4. And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 5. And Moses said unto the congregation, This {is} the thing which the LORD commanded to be done. 6. And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. 7. And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound {it} unto him therewith. 8. And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim. 9. And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, {even} upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses. 10. And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that {was} therein, and sanctified them. 11. And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them. 12. And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. 13. And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses. {put bonnets: Heb. bound bonnets} 14. And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering. 15. And he slew {it}; and Moses took the blood, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it. 16. And he took all the fat that {was} upon the inwards, and the caul {above} the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned {it} upon the altar. 17. But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses. 18. And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 19. And he killed {it}; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. 20. And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat. 21. And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it {was} a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, {and} an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 22. And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 23. And he slew {it}; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put {it} upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 24. And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about. 25. And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that {was} upon the inwards, and the caul {above} the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder: 26. And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that {was} before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put {them} on the fat, and upon the right shoulder: 27. And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands, and waved them {for} a wave offering before the LORD. 28. And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt {them} on the altar upon the burnt offering: they {were} consecrations for a sweet savour: it {is} an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 29. And Moses took the breast, and waved it {for} a wave offering before the LORD: {for} of the ram of consecration it was Moses' part; as the LORD commanded Moses. 30. And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which {was} upon the altar, and sprinkled {it} upon Aaron, {and} upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, {and} his garments, and his sons, and his sons' garments with him. 31. And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that {is} in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it. 32. And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire. 33. And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation {in} seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you. 34. As he hath done this day, {so} the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you. 35. Therefore shall ye abide {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded. 36. So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 91. So, on the eighth day, Moses hit up Aaron and his boys, along with the senior peeps of Israel. 2. Yo, Aaron, grab a fresh calf as a sacrifice for our sins, and a dope ram as a burnt offering. Make sure they're flawless, then present 'em to the LORD. 3. Yo, Israel fam, listen up. So, here's the deal - when it comes to dealing with sins and stuff, you gotta grab a baby goat, like, as an offering. And not just that, but you also need to bring a young calf and a lamb, ya know, newborn and all, with no flaws or anything. These little buddies are gonna be, like, burnt offerings and whatnot. 4. And bring a bullock and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the LORD, along with a meat offering mixed with oil. Today the LORD is gonna show up for you. 5. So they brought what Moses told them to bring to the tabernacle, and all the people gathered and stood in front of the Almighty. 6. Moses was like, yo listen up! God gave us the lowdown on what we gotta do. And if we follow it, we gonna witness some epic divine awesomeness from the LORD. 7. Yo, Aaron! Head to the altar and bring your sin offering, burnt offering, and make things right for yourself and the peeps. Offer the people's offering and make things right for them, just like the LORD told us. 8. So Aaron went up to the altar and killed the sin offering calf, which was for himself. 9. Then Aaron's boys brought him the blood and he like dipped his finger in it and put that stuff on the horns of the altar, and like spilled the rest of the blood at the bottom of the altar: 10. And he burned the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty layer above the liver of the sin offering on the altar, just as the LORD told Moses to do. 11. And he totally roasted the meat and the animal skin away from the camp using straight fire. 12. And he totally slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron's squad presented him with the blood, which he sprinkled all around on the altar. 13. And they gave him the burnt offering, along with its pieces and the head. And he burned them on the altar. 14. And he washed the insides and the legs, then he burned them on the altar along with the burnt offering. 15. Then he took the people's offering and grabbed the goat, which was the offering to make up for their mistakes. He killed it and presented it as a sacrifice to cleanse their sins, just like he did at first. 16. And he brought the burnt offering and totally flexed it, following all the lit rules and stuff. *Or you know, the ordinance, if you prefer that term.* 17. Then he grabbed a handful of the meat offering and burnt it on the altar, alongside the burnt sacrifice from this morning. He filled his hand with it, ya know? 18. He also killed the bull and the sheep as a peace offering for the people, and Aaron's sons gave him the blood to sprinkle all around the altar. 19. And like, the juicy parts of the bullock and ram, like the backside, and the stuff that covers the insides, and the kidneys, and the fatty part above the liver, ya know?  20. And they took the fat and placed it on top, then he burned it on the altar: 21. And Aaron flexed the boobs and the right shoulder, showing them off as an offering to the LORD, just like Moses told him to do. 22. And Aaron raised his hand towards the people and blessed them, then he stepped down from making the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings. 23. So Moses and Aaron entered the meeting hub, then came back out and gave a shoutout to the peeps. And boom, the amazing presence of the LORD was visible to everyone! 24. Then this fire just suddenly appeared in front of the LORD and totally destroyed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar! When everyone saw it, they were like freaking out and dropped to the ground, man. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 91. And it came to pass on the eighth day, {that} Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel; 2. And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer {them} before the LORD. 3. And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, {both} of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 4. Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you. 5. And they brought {that} which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD. 6. And Moses said, This {is} the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you. 7. And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded. 8. Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which {was} for himself. 9. And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 10. But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses. 11. And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. 12. And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. 13. And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt {them} upon the altar. 14. And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt {them} upon the burnt offering on the altar. 15. And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which {was} the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first. 16. And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner. {manner: or, ordinance} 17. And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt {it} upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning. {took...: Heb. filled his hand out of it} 18. He slew also the bullock and the ram {for} a sacrifice of peace offerings, which {was} for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 19. And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth {the inwards}, and the kidneys, and the caul {above} the liver: 20. And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar: 21. And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved {for} a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded. 22. And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings. 23. And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people. 24. And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: {which} when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 101. So Nadab and Abihu, Aaron's sons, each grabbed their own censer, loaded it with fire and added incense. They went ahead and offered unauthorized fire before the Lord, even though He didn't give them the green light for it. 2. Then the Lord sent out some crazy fire and totally wrecked them, and they were toast in front of the Lord. 3. Yo, Aaron, listen up. This is what the LORD said: 'I'm gonna show My greatness to those who approach Me, and in front of everyone, I'll be glorified.' And Aaron stayed quiet. 4. So Moses was like, 'Yo, Mishael and Elzaphan, you dudes who are Uzziel's sons and Aaron's cousins, come over here. I need you to grab your bros and get them out of the camp away from the sanctuary.' 5. So they like, approached the place and totally grabbed them undercover, like hiding them in their cool jackets and sneaked them out of the camp, just as Moses had told them to do. 6. Yo, Aaron and his homies Eleazar and Ithamar, listen up! Don't take off your hats or tear your clothes, aight? If you do, you might end up dead and bring God's anger down on everyone. Instead, let your peeps, the whole Israel crew, mourn the fire that the Lord started. 7. Don't dip out of the tabernacle hangout, or you might meet your maker. 'Cause the LORD's holy oil is on you. And they listened up to what Moses said. 8. So, God hit up Aaron and was like, 9. Yo fam, when you and your squad step into the congregation spot, make sure y'all ain't sippin' on wine or anything strong. It's a forever rule, passed down from generation to generation. If you break it, you might end up dead, so better play it safe! 10. And so you can tell the difference between what's sacred and what's not, and what's pure and what's impure; 11. So you can like, pass down all the rules that the LORD told Moses so that the children of Israel know what's up. 12. So Moses was like, 'Yo Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar, my boys, grab that leftover meat offering that the LORD was craving, and chow down near the altar, but make sure there's no yeast because it's super sacred and legit. 13. And like, you gotta chow down on it in the sacred spot, because it's like totally yours, and your sons' too, from the offerings that the LORD is all about burning up: 'cause that's what I've been told to tell ya. 14. So, like, make sure to chow down on the wave breast and heave shoulder in a tidy spot, fam. It's all good for you, your squad, and your fam. Cause, ya know, it's what you deserve, like your crew's rightful stuff, that comes from the peace offerings cooked up by the peeps of Israel. 15. They have to bring the heave shoulder and the wave breast along with the fire offerings of the fat, to wave it as an offering before the LORD. It's gonna be yours and your crew's forever, because the LORD said so. 16. So Moses was super determined to find the goat that was sacrificed for the sin, but guess what? It was totally burnt up! He was hella mad at Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's surviving sons, and he shouted at them, saying, 17. Yo, why haven't y'all chowed down on that sin offering in the holy spot? Like, it's super sacred and God hooked you up with it to take on the wrongdoing of the crew and make things right with the Lord, ya know? 18. Yo, listen up! The blood wasn't taken into the holy {place}. You were totally supposed to eat it there, just like I commanded, ya know? 19. So Aaron was like, 'Listen up Moses, today they brought their sin offering and burnt offering before the LORD, and some crazy stuff happened to me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would it be considered good in the LORD's eyes? 20. And when Moses found out, he was totally chill with it. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 101. And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them not. 2. And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died before the LORD. 3. Then Moses said unto Aaron, This {is it} that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace. 4. And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp. 5. So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said. 6. And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled. 7. And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD {is} upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses. 8. And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 9. Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: {it shall be} a statute for ever throughout your generations: 10. And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean; 11. And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses. 12. And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it {is} most holy: 13. And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it {is} thy due, and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded. 14. And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for {they be} thy due, and thy sons' due, {which} are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel. 15. The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave {it for} a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded. 16. And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron {which were} left {alive}, saying, 17. Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it {is} most holy, and {God} hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD? 18. Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy {place}: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy {place}, as I commanded. 19. And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have befallen me: and {if} I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of the LORD? 20. And when Moses heard {that}, he was content. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 111. So, God was like talking to Moses and Aaron, and here's what He said to them, 2. Yo, listen up, Israel fam! Check it, these are the animals you're allowed to munch on from all the animals on this planet. 3. You can totally chow down on animals that have split hooves, chew cud, and are all clovenfooted. Yum! 4. But like, don't eat these animals that chew their food over and over or that have like, split hooves: like camels, for example. They chew their food, but their hooves aren't split, so they're considered unclean for you. 5. And the coney, because it chews the cud but does not divide the hoof, it's considered unclean by you. 6. And like, the hare, 'cause it chews cud and stuff, but doesn't have split hooves, it's, like, totally unclean for you and stuff. 7. So, like, even though pigs have a split hoof and all, they don't chew the cud. Totally unclean, dude. 8. Don't chow down on their meat, and stay away from their dead bodies; they're totally gross and polluted to you. 9. You can totally chow down on all the fish that have fins and scales, whether they're chillin' in the oceans, seas, or rivers. 10. Any sea creature or river-dweller without fins and scales, basically anything swimming around in the waters, is like a total no-go and totally uncool. 11. Bruh, those things are total disgust, like legit abomination. Don't even think about munching on their meat, but straight up treat their dead bodies with utter repulsion. 12. Anything without fins or scales in the water? Like, totally not cool vibes, guys. It's a total abomination, like, seriously. Don't be into that, okay? 13. And these are the birds you should totally avoid; they're a big no-no: the eagle, the ossifrage, and the ospray. Don't even think about eating them, they're straight-up nasty. 14. And the vulture, and the kite, you know, same species and all; 15. Every raven clings to its own squad; 16. And like, there's this totally rad owl, and this super cool night hawk, and the cuckoo with its unique sound, and the hawk doing its thing, all chillin' and being awesome in their own way. 17. And there were these cool owls: the little owl, the cormorant, and the mighty great owl, 18. And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 19. And like, there's the stork and the heron, they're like totally their own thing, and then there's the lapwing and the bat too. 20. Yo, any birds that crawl on all fours? Yeah, they're totally not cool with me, feel me? It's like, they're a big no-no in my book. 21. But you can totally eat any of those rad flying bugs that walk on four legs and have long legs that help them hop around on the ground; 22. These are the ones you can chow down on: the locusts of various types, the bald locusts of their own kind, the beetles of their own kind, and the grasshoppers of their own kind. 23. But, like, all those other flying bugs that crawl with four legs are, like, totally gross and not cool, dude. They're, like, a major freak-out for you, ya know? 24. And like, if you happen to, um, touch the dead bodies of these things, you'll be totally unclean until the evening. Yeah, just be careful, okay? 25. If anyone touches any part of a dead animal, they gotta wash their clothes and they'll be unclean until evening. 26. Dude, any animal that doesn't have a split hoof or chew the cud, it's totally uncool for you. If you touch those animals, you'll be uncool too. 27. And anything that walks on its paws, like all kinds of four-legged animals, those are considered uncool to you: if you touch their dead body, you'll be uncool until the evening. 28. If you touch those dead animals, you need to wash your clothes and you'll stay dirty until the evening. Yep, they're totally gross and unclean for you. 29. These little creatures, like, totally won't be cool with you, you know? I'm talking about the weasel, the mouse, and the tortoise family, man. 30. And like, there were also these super cool animals called ferrets, chameleons, lizards, snails, and moles. 31. These are the disgusting creatures that you should avoid: anyone who touches them, even if they're already dead, will be gross until sunset. 32. If anything dead falls on any of these things, they will become unclean. Whether it's a wooden utensil, clothing, animal skin, or a bag - basically anything that's used for something - it has to be washed with water and will remain unclean until evening. Then it will be considered clean again. 33. If any of them falls into a regular container, everything in it becomes unclean and you have to shatter it. 34. Like, any food that gets all wet is like, totally unclean, and any drink in, like, any container that gets all wet is also unclean. So, yeah. 35. And anything that comes into contact with their dead bodies will be considered unclean. Whether it's an oven or a stovetop, it has to be destroyed because it's contaminated and it'll make you unclean too. 36. But like, if a water source has lots of water, it's considered clean. But if anything touches a dead body, it's like totally unclean, dude. 37. If any part of their dead body falls onto any seeds that are being planted, it'll be considered clean. 38. But like, if any water accidentally gets on the plant, and like, any part of a dead animal falls on it, then it's gonna be unclean for you, dude. 39. If any animal that you're allowed to eat dies, whoever touches its dead body will be unclean until the evening. 40. If you chow down on that dead animal, you gotta clean your threads and stay dirty until the end of the day. And if you're carrying around that dead creature, clean your clothes too and stay unclean until the evening. 41. And anything that crawls on the ground is, like, totally gross and disgusting; it's a big no-no to eat it. 42. You can't eat anything that crawls on its belly, or anything that walks on all fours, or anything that has more than four feet among all the crawling creatures on the earth, because they are disgusting. 43. Don't ever let yourselves be tainted by any disgusting creepy stuff, and don't let yourselves get dirty with them either, 'cause that would totally mess you up. 44. Bruh, I'm the LORD your God, so like, you gotta make yourselves pure and be legit holy, 'cause I'm all about that holy life too, you know? And yo, don't mess with any creepy crawlies that roam the earth, okay? Stay clean and chill. 45. Dudes, I'm the LORD who totally rescued you guys from Egypt and became your God. So, you gotta be super holy, just like me. #HolinessGoals 46. Yo, here's the lowdown on the rules for beasts, birds, all the living creatures that swim in the waters, and those that crawl on the earth: 47. To distinguish between what's gross and what's rad, and between the animals you can chow down on and the ones you gotta leave alone. \n",

      "Gen Z: Leviticus 121. Yo, God was like, Mosess, listen up!' 2. Yo, tell the Israelites this: If a woman gets preggo and has a baby boy, she gotta be considered unclean for a whole week. She gotta follow the same rules as when she's on her period, ya know? Unclean and all. 3. And on the eighth day, they're gonna snip off the extra skin down there. 4. After her period of purification, she must wait for thirty-three days before she can touch anything holy or enter the sacred place. 5. But if she has a baby girl, she'll be considered unclean for two weeks, just like during her period. After that, she must wait for sixty-six days to complete her purification. 6. Once her purification time is over after giving birth to a son or daughter, she should bring a lamb that's a year old as a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove as a sin offering to the entrance of the tabernacle. She must present them to the priest. 7. Yo, who's gonna present it to the LORD and make things right for her, so she can be cleansed from the blood situation? This is the rule for any chick who gives birth, whether it's a boy or a girl. 8. And if she can't afford a lamb, she can bring two turtles or two young pigeons instead. One is for the burnt offering and the other for a sin offering. The priest will make things right for her, and she will be considered clean. \n",

Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This {is} the law for her that hath born a male or a female. 8. And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean. {she be...: Heb. her hand find not sufficiency of} \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 131. So, like, God totally talked to Moses and Aaron. He was all like, 2. If a dude has some weird stuff going on with his skin, like a bump, a nasty scab, or a funky spot, and it looks like that leprosy thing, he's gotta go see Aaron the priest or one of his sons who are also priests. Yeah, it's like a swelling too, just to be clear. 3. So, like, the priest gotta check out this skin problem, right? If the hair in the infected area is all white and the problem is worse than just on the surface, it's definitely leprosy. The priest will give it a look and, like, declare the person unclean. 4. If there's a white spot on your skin that's not too deep, and the hair there isn't turning white, the priest will quarantine you for seven days. 5. Yo, the priest gotta peep him on the seventh day and check it out, if the infection looks the same and ain't spreading on the skin, then the priest gotta keep him in isolation for another seven days: 6. And the priest gonna check him again on the seventh day: and, yo, if the rash looks darker but ain't spreading on the skin, the priest gonna say he's clean: it's just a scab. Then he gotta wash his clothes and he good to go. 7. But yo, if the scab starts spreading all over the skin after the priest has checked it for cleansing, then the priest gotta take another look: 8. And if the priest notices that, like, yo, the scab is spreading on the skin, then the priest gotta be all 'dude, you're unclean, it's totally leprosy'. 9. So, if a guy gets hit with leprosy, he's gotta go see the priest. 10. And the priest will check it out: if the skin has a white bump and the hair turned white, and there's some fresh raw flesh in the bump; it's a sign of a live, active infection. 11. Yo, his skin got that ancient leprosy vibes, and the priest gonna be like, 'Yo, bro, you unclean, but I ain't gonna quarantine you or nothing, just so y'know, 'cause you unclean n' all. 12. Yo, if you got leprosy spreading all over your skin, from head to toe, the priest gonna notice it, no cap. 13. So like, the priest should totally check it out: and woah, if the leprosy has spread all over his body, he'll be declared clean from the disease: it's all turned white, dude! He's in the clear. 14. But if there's a gross skin issue, he's gonna be considered unclean. 15. And the priest will check out the gnarly skin, and say it's unclean: because gnarly skin is totally unclean, dude: it's like leprosy, you know? 16. If the infected skin heals and becomes white again, they should go see the priest; 17. So the priest checks him out, and if the infection looks white, then the priest declares him squeaky clean from the infection. He's all clear, no worries. 18. And like, there was this total gross boil on their flesh, even on the skin, but then it like magically got healed, you know? 19. If a boil appears on the skin and it's white with a red tinge, the person should show it to the priest. 20. And like, if the priest sees it and, whoa, it looks like it's beneath the skin and the hair turns white, the priest will totally say the person is unclean. It's, like, a serious case of leprosy coming from the boil. 21. But yo, if the priest peep it and there ain't no white hairs and it ain't deeper than the skin but kinda dark, then the priest gonna keep them isolated for a whole week: 22. If it spreads a lot on the skin, the priest will say the person is unclean: it's a plague. 23. But if the TikTok trend stays the same and doesn't go viral, it's just a basic burn, and the priest will say it's all good. 24. Or if someone's skin has a fiery burn with a bright white or somewhat reddish, white spot on it... 25. So like, the priest gotta check it out, and if the hair in the bright spot is like, totally white and looks deeper than the skin, then it's like a leprosy thingy that comes from a burn or something. That's when the priest says the person is unclean, like it's a legit leprosy situation. 26. But yo, if the priest peep it and sees that there ain't no white hair in the spot that's lit up, and it ain't no different from the rest of the skin, but kinda darker; then the priest gotta put homie on lockdown for seven days: 27. On the seventh day, the priest checks them out. If there's a lot of spreading on the skin, the priest declares them unclean because it's the nasty leprosy. 28. And if the lit spot stays where it is, and doesn't spread on the skin but kinda darkens, it's just a mild burn, and the priest will declare them clean, because it's just an inflammation from the burn. 29. If a dude or chick have a nasty sore on their head or their beard; 30. So like, the priest has to check out the disease, you know? And if it's like, more than just a surface thing, like if it's deep, and there's this weird yellow hair on it, then the priest is all like, 'Dude, you're unclean!' It's this dry scaly thing, like leprosy, on your head or beard. 31. So, like, if the priest checks out this skin issue and sees that it's not too deep, and there's no black hair in it, then he's gonna isolate the person with the issue for a week, okay? 32. And on day seven, the priest will check out the skin infection. If the scabby patch hasn't gotten bigger and there's no yellow hair in it, and it's not deeper than the surface of the skin, 33. He gotta shave his head, but he can't touch that scaly patch; and the priest gonna keep the one with the patch locked up for another seven days: 34. And on the seventh day, the priest will check out the scall and, yo, if the scall hasn't spread on the skin or goes deeper than the skin, then the priest will declare the person clean. They gotta wash their clothes and be clean, ya know. 35. But yo, if that scall keeps spreading all over the skin even after it's been cleansed; 36. So, like, the priest checks out the person and if the rash has like, spread on the skin, the priest doesn't have to look for blonde hair, cuz that person's unclean, man. 37. But if the rash is still there and has black hair growing in it, the rash has healed and he is good to go. The priest declares him clean. 38. If someone, whether it's a dude or a girl, has these lit white spots on their skin, 39. So, like, the priest needs to check out these spots on their skin, and if they're kind of like darkish white, then it's just like a cool freckle thing and they're all good, no worries. 40. And the dude whose hair has fallen out, he's bald, but he's legit clean. #freshshave 41. If someone's hair is falling off from the front of their head, making them forehead bald, they're still considered clean. 42. And yo, if there's like a white reddish sore on the bald head or the bald forehead, that's straight up leprosy popping off in his bald head or his bald forehead. 43. So, like, the priest checks it out, and if there's, like, a white or reddish sore on their bald head or forehead, it's, you know, like leprosy on the skin. 44. He's, like, a super messed up dude, totally unclean: the priest's gonna be all, 'Yeah, he's seriously unclean, no hope for him.' His sickness is like, in his head, you know? 45. If someone has leprosy, they gotta rip their clothes, go bald, cover their mouth, and yell 'I'm unclean, super unclean!' 46. Like, for real, any day that he's got that plague, he's totally contaminated and defiled. Gross, right? He's all unclean and stuff. So he's gotta live all by himself, outside the camp. That's where he's gonna stay, you know? 47. And like, if there's this piece of clothing with leprosy, whether it's made of wool or linen, ya know, 48. Whether it's in the cool design or the cozy fabric - be it linen or wool, or even some dope leather goods - in whatever fly form it comes, rock it with style and flair. No matter if it's stitched or crafted, make it a masterpiece of creativity. 49. If there's like this green or red blotch on a piece of clothing or your skin or anything made of skin, whether it's like the pattern or the fabric itself, it's most likely leprosy and you gotta go show it to the priest. The word 'thing' in Hebrew means like a vessel or an instrument, by the way. 50. And the priest will check out the nasty situation and quarantine the person with the problem for a whole week: 51. And he gotta check out the disease after a whole week: if the disease spread through the clothes, whether in the threads or in the fabric, or even on some animal skin, or anything made of animal skin; then it's a nasty case of leprosy; it's totally unclean. 52. So, like, that outfit has gotta be totally burned if it's made of wool or linen or any kinda animal skin and has some nasty leprosy thing going on. Burn it all up, man! 53. And if the priest checks it out and sees that the infection hasn't spread on the clothing, whether it's in the threads, fabric, or anything made of leather; 54. Then the priest will be like, 'Yo, wash that thing where the plague is, and keep it quarantined for another seven days, fam.' 55. Then the priest will check the skin rash after it has been washed and, look, if the rash hasn't changed color and hasn't spread, then it is considered unclean. You have to burn it up in the fire because it has corroded deep down, whether it's bald on the head or on the forehead. 56. And if the priest checks it out, and, like, sees that the skin condition is still kinda shady even after washing it, then he should totally tear it out of the clothes or the skin or the pattern, ya know? 57. And if the stain is still on the clothing, whether on the design or the fabric or any kind of material; it's a contagious infection: you need to destroy the affected item by setting it on fire. 58. Yo, check it. If you gotta clean some clothes or whatever, whether it's made of threads or animal skin or whatever, after you've washed it and the disease is gone, you gotta wash it again to make sure it's completely clean. 59. So basically, here's how it goes when it comes to leprosy in clothes, whether it's made of wool, linen, or even animal skin. You either say it's clean or you say it's unclean, following the rules. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 131. And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 2. When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh {like} the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his sons the priests: {rising: or, swelling} 3. And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and {when} the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight {be} deeper than the skin of his flesh, it {is} a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. 4. If the bright spot {be} white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight {be} not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the plague seven days: 5. And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, {if} the plague in his sight be at a stay, {and} the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more: 6. And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, {if} the plague {be} somewhat dark, {and} the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it {is but} a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 7. But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again: 8. And {if} the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} a leprosy. 9. When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest; 10. And the priest shall see {him}: and, behold, {if} the rising {be} white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and {there be} quick raw flesh in the rising; {quick...: Heb. the quickening of living flesh} 11. It {is} an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he {is} unclean. 12. And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of {him that hath} the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh; 13. Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, {if} the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce {him} clean {that hath} the plague: it is all turned white: he {is} clean. 14. But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. 15. And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: {for} the raw flesh {is} unclean: it {is} a leprosy. 16. Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest; 17. And the priest shall see him: and, behold, {if} the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce {him} clean {that hath} the plague: he {is} clean. 18. The flesh also, in which, {even} in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed, 19. And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest; 20. And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it {be} in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil. 21. But if the priest look on it, and, behold, {there be} no white hairs therein, and {if} it {be} not lower than the skin, but {be} somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 22. And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} a plague. 23. But if the bright spot stay in his place, {and} spread not, it {is} a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean. 24. Or if there be {any} flesh, in the skin whereof {there is} a hot burning, and the quick {flesh} that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white; {a hot...: Heb. a burning of fire} 25. Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, {if} the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it {be in} sight deeper than the skin; it {is} a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} the plague of leprosy. 26. But if the priest look on it, and, behold, {there be} no white hair in the bright spot, and it {be} no lower than the {other} skin, but {be} somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 27. And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: {and} if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} the plague of leprosy. 28. And if the bright spot stay in his place, {and} spread not in the skin, but it {be} somewhat dark; it {is} a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it {is} an inflammation of the burning. 29. If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard; 30. Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it {be} in sight deeper than the skin; {and there be} in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it {is} a dry scall, {even} a leprosy upon the head or beard. 31. And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it {be} not in sight deeper than the skin, and {that there is} no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the plague of the scall seven days: 32. And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, {if} the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall {be} not in sight deeper than the skin; 33. He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up {him that hath} the scall seven days more: 34. And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, {if} the scall be not spread in the skin, nor {be} in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 35. But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing; 36. Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he {is} unclean. 37. But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and {that} there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he {is} clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean. 38. If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, {even} white bright spots; 39. Then the priest shall look: and, behold, {if} the bright spots in the skin of their flesh {be} darkish white; it {is} a freckled spot {that} groweth in the skin; he {is} clean. 40. And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he {is} bald; {yet is} he clean. {hair...: Heb. head is pilled} 41. And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he {is} forehead bald: {yet is} he clean. 42. And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it {is} a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead. 43. Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, {if} the rising of the sore {be} white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; 44. He is a leprous man, he {is} unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague {is} in his head. 45. And the leper in whom the plague {is}, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean. 46. All the days wherein the plague {shall be} in him he shall be defiled; he {is} unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp {shall} his habitation {be}. 47. The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, {whether it be} a woollen garment, or a linen garment; 48. Whether {it be} in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin; {thing...: Heb. work of} 49. And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it {is} a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest: {thing: Heb. vessel, or, instrument} 50. And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up {it that hath} the plague seven days: 51. And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, {or} in any work that is made of skin; the plague {is} a fretting leprosy; it {is} unclean. 52. He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it {is} a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. 53. And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; 54. Then the priest shall command that they wash {the thing} wherein the plague {is}, and he shall shut it up seven days more: 55. And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, {if} the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it {is} unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it {is} fret inward, {whether} it {be} bare within or without. {whether...: Heb. whether it be bald in the head thereof, or in the forehead thereof} 56. And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague {be} somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 57. And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it {is} a spreading {plague}: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague {is} with fire. 58. And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin {it be}, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. 59. This {is} the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 141. God was like, yo Moses, listen up! 2. Here's the deal for dealing with a leper who's getting cleansed: they gotta be taken to the priest. 3. So, like, the priest, right? He'll like, leave the whole camp and stuff. And then he's gonna check out the leper, you know? And if the leprosy's all healed and stuff, like, that's a good sign, ya know? 4. So, the priest tells the person who needs to be purified to gather two birds that are alive and clean, along with some cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop. You can also use sparrows instead of birds, by the way. 5. Then the priest will be like, 'Yo, take one of them birds and snuff it out in a clay pot with water flowin' through it:' 6. Now, take the cool bird, along with some cedar wood, scarlet thread, and hyssop. Dip them and the living bird into the blood of the bird that was killed over the flowing water. 7. Then he's gotta sprinkle that dude with the leprosy seven times, say he's all good, and let the bird back into the wild open field. 8. The person getting cleaned up needs to freshen up their outfit, give themselves a clean shave, and take a nice refreshing shower to feel all fresh and clean. Then they can join the group and hang out outside their tent for a whole week. 9. But on the seventh day, he has to like, totally shave all his hair off - head, beard, eyebrows, the whole deal. And not just that, he's gotta wash his clothes and his body in water, you know? Then he'll be all clean and good to go. 10. So, on the 8th day, grab two male lambs that are perfect, no flaws. Also, get one female lamb that's less than a year old, also flawless. Then get a small amount of top-notch flour, mix it with some oil for an offering, and also bring some more oil. 11. And the priest who helps the guy get clean will bring the clean dude, and all that stuff, to the LORD, at the entrance of the cool meeting place: 12. The priest should nab a dope lamb and offer it as a trespass offering. And don't forget to bring the log of oil, then wave them as a lit wave offering in front of the LORD. 13. And he's gotta kill the lamb in the same spot where he's doin' the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place. 'Cause just like the sin offering is for the priest, the trespass offering is super holy too! 14. So the priest will take some of the blood from the offering for wrongdoing and put it on the tip of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being purified. 15. Then the priest will grab some of the oil and pour it into the palm of his own left hand: 16. Then the priest will take some of the oil from his left hand and dip his right finger into it. He will sprinkle the oil seven times in front of the LORD using his finger. 17. The priest gotta take the leftover oil he's got and put a little bit on the right ear, right thumb, and right big toe of the person who needs to be cleansed, right on top of the blood from the trespass offering. 18. And the little bit of oil that's left in the priest's hand, he needs to pour it on the head of the person who needs to be cleansed. Then the priest will do his thing to make things right for that person in front of the LORD. 19. And the priest will flex with the sin offering, to make things right for the person who needs cleaning up from their impurity; and then they'll straight up slay the burnt offering: 20. So like, the priest will totally put the burnt offering and the meat offering on the altar, you know? And then the priest will like, do this thing to make everything cool and make up for any bad vibes. Then, the person will be all purified and good to go. 21. If he's broke and can't afford it, he can bring one lamb as a peace offering, wave it around to make up for his mistake. He should also bring one-tenth of a deal of fancy flour mixed with oil as a food offering, and a log of oil. 22. And like, get two turtledoves or two young pigeons, you know, whatever he can find. One of them is gonna be for like, making up for sin or whatever, and the other one is gonna be, like, completely burnt up as an offering. 23. And on the eighth day, he gotta bring them to the priest, right at the door of the chill tabernacle, in front of the LORD, to get their cleansing on. 24. Then the priest gotta grab the lamb for the forgiveness offering, and the vial of oil, and like, totally wave them as an offering to the Lord, ya know? 25. And the dude will slay the lamb for the apology, and the priest will take some of the lamb's blood and dab it on the top of the right ear of the person being cleansed, and on the thumb of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot. 26. Then the priest gotta pour some oil into the palm of his own left hand, no cap: 27. Then the priest will dab some of the oil from his left hand with his right finger seven times in front of the LORD: 28. And the priest will dab some of the oil he's got in his hand on the top part of the right ear of the person who needs to be purified. He'll also put some on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot, right on the spot where the blood from the sin offering is. 29. And the leftover oil that the priest has, he should apply on the head of the person being purified, to make things right with the LORD. 30. And he should totally offer one of those turtledoves or young pigeons, whatever he can find tbh; 31. If he wants to make up for his sin, he should bring a sin-offering and a burnt-offering, along with some food. Then the priest can make things right for him in front of the LORD. 32. This is the rule for someone with leprosy, whose hand can't reach what they need to get clean. 33. Yo, the LORD was like, talking to Moses and Aaron, and this is what He said, 34. Once you guys enter Canaan, the place I'm hooking you up with as your new digs, and I drop a nasty leprosy situation in one of your homes in your hood; 35. And the person who owns the house will go and inform the priest, like, 'Yo, it kinda looks like there's some crazy stuff going on in this house, like a major problem or something:' 36. Then the priest is gonna be like, 'Yo, everyone needs to dip from the crib before I step in and check out the situation. We don't want anything in the house getting contaminated. After that, the priest can enter the house and do his thing. Emptying it or getting it ready, you know. 37. And he'll check out the infection, like, if there's this infection happening on the walls of the crib, with some weird looking green or red marks, which are like, lower than the wall, ya know? 38. After that, the priest bounces out of the crib and seals the door tight for a whole week: 39. So, like, the priest will come back on the seventh day and check it out, you know? And, like, if the disease has, like, spread on the walls of the house, then yeah, there's a problem. 40. Then the priest will be like, 'Yo, get rid of those gross stones with the plague on them. Just chuck 'em somewhere dirty outside the city, man. 41. And he's gonna make sure the whole crib gets a deep clean, like, everywhere. They're gonna dump all the dust they scrape off outside the city in a gross spot, though. No mess inside, yo. 42. And they're gonna swap out those stones for new ones, ya know? Then they'll grab some fresh mortar and start patching up the house. 43. And if the plague pops up once more in the house, after you've removed the stones, scraped it clean, and put on a fresh coat of paint; 44. So the priest will come and check it out, and if he sees that the infection has spread throughout the house, then it's a serious case of leprosy in the house and it's considered unclean. 45. And he will totally wreck the whole house, demolishing every single stone, all the wood, and even the mortar. Then he'll haul it all away from the city to some dirty spot. 46. Also, if someone goes into the house while it's shut, they'll be considered unclean until the evening. 47. Anyone chillin' indoors gotta do laundry; same goes for anyone grubbin' in the house, gotta do laundry too. 48. So, like, if the priest checks out the house and sees that the plague hasn't spread, after they've plastered it up and stuff, then the priest will be all like, 'The house is all good, man, the plague is healed.' 49. So, like, he's gotta grab two birds, some cedar wood, scarlet material, and this herb called hyssop, to clean the house and stuff: 50. And he's gonna take one of the birds and off it goes in like a clay pot full of fresh water: 51. Then he'll grab some cedar wood, hyssop, scarlet, a live bird, and dip them in the blood of the dead bird and running water. After that, he'll sprinkle the house seven times. 52. Then he gotta purify the crib using the bird's blood, running water, a live bird, cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet. 53. But he gotta set free the bird, like, outside the city in, like, wide open spaces, and do this atonement thing for the house, and it'll be all clean and stuff. 54. Here's the rundown on how to deal with any type of leprosy or scaly skin issues: 55. And for when a piece of clothing or a house is infected with a bad vibe, 56. And for a bump or rash or any weird skin thing: 57. So like, here's the deal: this is the lowdown on dealing with leprosy. Like, when things are unclean or clean, this is the law you gotta follow. You gotta know what's up in the day when things are unclean and when they're clean, you know? \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 141. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest: 3. And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, {if} the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper; 4. Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive {and} clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: {birds: or, sparrows} 5. And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water: 6. As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird {that was} killed over the running water: 7. And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field. {into...: Heb. upon the face of the field} 8. And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days. 9. But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean. 10. And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour {for} a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. {of the...: Heb. the daughter of her year} 11. And the priest that maketh {him} clean shall present the man that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: 12. And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them {for} a wave offering before the LORD: 13. And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering {is} the priest's, {so is} the trespass offering: it {is} most holy: 14. And the priest shall take {some} of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put {it} upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot: 15. And the priest shall take {some} of the log of oil, and pour {it} into the palm of his own left hand: 16. And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that {is} in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD: 17. And of the rest of the oil that {is} in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering: 18. And the remnant of the oil that {is} in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD. 19. And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering: 20. And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be clean. 21. And if he {be} poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb {for} a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil; {cannot...: Heb. his hand reach not} {to be...: Heb. for a waving} 22. And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering. 23. And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD. 24. And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them {for} a wave offering before the LORD: 25. And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest shall take {some} of the blood of the trespass offering, and put {it} upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot: 26. And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand: 27. And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger {some} of the oil that {is} in his left hand seven times before the LORD: 28. And the priest shall put of the oil that {is} in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering: 29. And the rest of the oil that {is} in the priest's hand he shall put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him before the LORD. 30. And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons, such as he can get; 31. {Even} such as he is able to get, the one {for} a sin offering, and the other {for} a burnt offering, with the meat offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be cleansed before the LORD. 32. This {is} the law {of him} in whom {is} the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get {that which pertaineth} to his cleansing. 33. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 34. When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession; 35. And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me {there is} as it were a plague in the house: 36. Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the priest go {into it} to see the plague, that all that {is} in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in to see the house: {empty: or, prepare} 37. And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, {if} the plague {be} in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or reddish, which in sight {are} lower than the wall; 38. Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days: 39. And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and, behold, {if} the plague be spread in the walls of the house; 40. Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague {is}, and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city: 41. And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place: 42. And they shall take other stones, and put {them} in the place of those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house. 43. And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered; 44. Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, {if} the plague be spread in the house, it {is} a fretting leprosy in the house: it {is} unclean. 45. And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry {them} forth out of the city into an unclean place. 46. Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even. 47. And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 48. And if the priest shall come in, and look {upon it}, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed. {shall come...: Heb. in coming in shall come in, etc} 49. And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: 50. And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water: 51. And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times: 52. And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet: 53. But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean. 54. This {is} the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and scall, 55. And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house, 56. And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot: 57. To teach when {it is} unclean, and when {it is} clean: this {is} the law of leprosy. {when it is unclean...: Heb. in the day of the unclean, and in the day of the clean} \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 151. So, like, the LORD was talking to Moses and Aaron, and He was like, 2. Yo, listen up, Israelites! So, if any dude has like a gross bodily discharge, he's totally unclean because of it. Gross, huh? Yeah, it's like that. 3. And this is how he becomes unclean when he has a bodily discharge: whether his bodily fluids flow freely or they are blocked, it's what makes him unclean. 4. Any bed the person with the condition lies on is not clean, and anything they sit on is also not clean. 5. If anyone touches their bed, they gotta wash their clothes, take a bath, and stay unclean until evening. 6. If someone sat on something that someone with an issue sat on, they gotta wash their clothes, take a bath, and they'll be unclean until evening. 7. If someone touches the infected person's skin, they gotta wash their clothes, take a shower, and stay unclean until the evening. 8. And if someone with a spitting problem spits on someone who is clean, then they should wash their clothes and take a shower with water, and they will be considered unclean until the evening. 9. And any chair that someone with the condition sits on will be considered unclean. 10. And anyone who touches anything that was under them will be unclean until the evening. If someone carries any of those things, they should wash their clothes and take a shower, and they will be unclean until the evening. 11. If he touches someone who has a contagious disease and forgets to wash his hands with water, he needs to clean his clothes and take a full-on water bath. He'll be considered unclean until the evening. 12. If someone with a nasty condition touches something made of clay, it needs to be smashed. And anything made of wood should be washed with water. 13. And once the person who had a bodily discharge has been healed from it, they should wait for seven days as a part of their cleansing process. They should also wash their clothes, take a shower with flowing water, and then they'll be good to go, all clean and fresh. 14. And on the eighth day, he should bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and go before the LORD at the entrance of the tabernacle, and give them to the priest: 15. Then the priest is gonna offer them, one for like a sin thingy, and the other for like a burnt offering, ya know? And the priest is gonna make everything cool with the Lord for him and his like, issues and stuff. 16. If a guy's stuff comes out, he needs to wash his whole bod with water and stay dirty until evening. 17. Any clothes or fabrics with bodily fluids on them need to be washed with water and will remain unclean until evening time. 18. When a dude hooks up with a chick and they do the dirty, they gotta take a quick shower and stay unclean till evening. 19. If a girl is having a menstrual flow and there's blood coming out of her body, she should stay away from others for seven days. Anyone who touches her will be considered impure until the evening. 20. Anything she sits or lies on while she's in her separate time will be considered unclean, including the things she uses. 21. If anyone touches her bed, they gotta wash their clothes, take a shower, and yup, they're gonna be unclean until the evening. 22. If anyone touches anything she sat on, they should wash their clothes, take a shower, and they'll be considered unclean until evening. 23. And if it happens to be on her bed or on anything she sits on, when he touches it, he will be considered unclean until the evening. 24. And if anyone hooks up with her and she's on her period, he'll be considered unclean for a week. And the bed they get busy on will also be unclean. 25. And if a girl has a situation where she's bleeding for many days outside the time of her separation, or if it goes on longer than her separation period, then all the days of her being unclean due to the bleeding will be just like her separation days. 26. Any bed she uses during her time of menstruation will be considered her special designated period bed, and anything she sits on will become unclean, just like her menstruation. 27. And whoever touches those things will be like, totally unclean, and must wash their clothes and take a refreshing bath using water, and they'll remain unclean until the evening. 28. But if she is healed from her condition, then she will wait for seven days, and after that she will be considered clean. 29. On day eight, she's supposed to bring two turtles or two young pigeons to the priest, right at the entrance of the tabernacle where everyone gathers. 30. The priest gotta bring one animal for a sin offering and another for a burnt offering. Then the priest gotta make things right with the LORD for the lady's uncleanness. 31. So basically, make sure the Israelites keep themselves clean to avoid meeting a grim fate of dying in their impurity. Gotta respect my tabernacle, which is chillin' with them, you know? 32. Here's the deal for anyone dealing with reproductive health issues and accidentally spreading their seed, making things messy and unconventional; 33. And for anyone experiencing health issues, whether it's related to menstruation or any other bodily discharge, whether it's a man or a woman, or anyone engaging in activities with someone considered unclean. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 151. And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 2.

And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. 18. The woman also with whom man shall lie {with} seed of copulation, they shall {both} bathe {themselves} in water, and be unclean until the even. 19.

      "Gen Z: Leviticus 161. So, like, after Aaron's two sons offered stuff to the LORD and ended up dying, the LORD started talking to Moses, you know? 2. God was like, 'Yo Moses, tell your bro Aaron he can't just stroll into the super sacred spot behind the curtain in front of the mercy seat whenever he feels like it. If he does, he's gonna end up dead, because I'mma show up in the cloud right above the mercy seat. 3. So Aaron should enter the sacred {spot} with a rad young bull for a sin-offering and a dope ram for a burnt offering. 4. He's gotta put on that fresh holy linen coat, and rock those linen breeches on his bod. Gotta flex that linen girdle and top it off with a linen mitre. Those clothes are hella sacred, so he better cleanse his skin with water before wearing them. 5. So, basically, he's gonna grab two baby goats from the crew of Israelite peeps as a sacrifice for their sins. Oh, and also a ram for a fire sacrifice. 6. And Aaron will need to flex his sin-offering bull, just for himself, and take care of his own business, and his fam too. 7. And he's gonna grab those two goats and bring them over to the LORD, like right outside the tabernacle. It's gonna be lit at the door of the congregation, fam. 8. And Aaron gotta draw straws for the two goats: one for God, and the other one for the scapegoat. Scapegoat, by the way, is Hebrew for Azazel. #randomgoatselect 9. And Aaron's gonna bring the goat that got picked by the LORD, and offer it as a sin offering. Ya know, the one that got chosen and all. 10. But like, the goat that got picked as the scapegoat, it's gotta be brought in front of the LORD all alive and stuff, to make things right, ya know? And then it's gotta be set free into the wilderness as the official scapegoat. 11. So Aaron is gonna bring this bullock, which is basically a big ol' cow, for the sin offering. He's gotta do this for himself first, and make things right, you know? Not just for himself though, but also for his family. Then, he's gotta take that cow and kill it, 'cause that's the whole point of the sin offering for himself. 12. And he will grab a censer full of fiery coals from the altar in front of the LORD, and his hands full of crushed sweet incense, and carry it inside the curtain: 13. And, like, he's gonna light up the incense in front of the LORD, so that the smoke hides the mercy seat, you know, the one on top of the testimony, just to make sure he doesn't accidentally, like, bite the dust or anything. 14. Then he'll take some of the bull's blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat towards the east. He'll sprinkle the blood on the mercy seat seven times with his finger. 15. So he'll sacrifice the goat for the sin offering, specifically for the people, and take its blood inside the curtain. He'll treat the goat's blood just like he did with the bull's blood, sprinkling it on the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat. 16. And he's gonna like, fix the holy {place}, 'cause the guys from Israel have been super dirty and doing all sorts of bad stuff. So, he's gonna do the same for the tabernacle where everyone gathers, 'cause it's still chillin' with them even though they're all dirty. 17. Yo, no one should be up in the tabernacle of the congregation when he's about to go in and do his thing to make things right in the holy spot. He gotta come out first, and make things right for himself, his fam, and the whole congregation of Israel. 18. Then he's gonna head over to the altar in front of the LORD and make things right there, you know? He'll grab some blood from the bull and the goat and spread it on the corners of the altar. It's all about making things right and cleansing, you dig? 19. Then he's gonna sprinkle the blood on it seven times with his finger, making it all clean and sacred, getting rid of all the icky stuff that made it impure from the Israelite squad. 20. And once he's finished making everything in the holy {place}, and the gathering spot, and the altar all good again, he's gonna bring in the live goat: 21. So Aaron will put both his hands on the head of the goat that's still alive, and he'll admit all the wrongdoings and sins of the people of Israel. Then, he'll place all that guilt on the goat's head and have a capable guy lead the goat away into the wild-lands. (And just so you know, that capable guy is like, the right person at the right time!) 22. And the goat, like, totally gonna carry all their bad stuff, you know, to this deserted place and then just set it free. Wild, right? 🔥 23. So Aaron's gonna step into the tabernacle hangout spot and take off his fancy linen clothes that he wore when he went to the super sacred place and leave 'em there. 24. Then he gotta clean himself up with water in this holy spot, put on his fresh clothes, step outside, and make his burnt offering for himself and the rest of the people to make things right. 25. And he's gotta like, totally roast the fatty part of the sin offering on the altar, no cap. 26. The person who releases the goat as the scapegoat needs to wash their clothes, cleanse their body with water, and then return to the camp. 27. The bullock and the goat, which were sacrificed to make up for our wrongdoings, must be taken outside the camp and burned, including their skin, flesh, and dung. 28. And the person who burns them should wash their clothes and clean themselves in water, and only then may they return to the camp. 29. Yo, here's the deal: this is gonna be a never-ending rule for y'all. On the seventh month, specifically the tenth day, you gotta lay low and take a break – no workin' at all. And I mean everyone, whether you're from here or just visiting. 30. Because, like dude, on that day, the priest will totally hook you up with an atonement that will cleanse you, so you can be, like, super clean from all your sins in front of the LORD, you know? 31. It's like a chill day off for you, where you don't stress out and just take it easy, totally intentionally, forever. 32. And the priest, who he will choose and dedicate to serve as a priest in place of his father, will make amends and wear the special holy clothes, also known as the 'fill his hand' garments. 33. And he's gotta do this whole atonement thing for the holy sanctuary, the tabernacle where everyone gathers, the altar, the priests, and like, every single person in the whole congregation, you know? 34. So this is gonna be a forever rule for you, like a tradition, to make up for all the wrong stuff the Israelites do once a year. And yeah, the dude totally followed what the LORD told Moses to do. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 161. And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died; 2. And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come not at all times into the holy {place} within the vail before the mercy seat, which {is} upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat. 3. Thus shall Aaron come into the holy {place}: with a young bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering. 4. He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these {are} holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and {so} put them on. 5. And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering. 6. And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which {is} for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house. 7. And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 8. And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat. {scapegoat: Heb. Azazel} 9. And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD'S lot fell, and offer him {for} a sin offering. {fell: Heb. went up} 10. But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, {and} to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness. 11. And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which {is} for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which {is} for himself: 12. And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring {it} within the vail: 13. And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that {is} upon the testimony, that he die not: 14. And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle {it} with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times. 15. Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that {is} for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat: 16. And he shall make an atonement for the holy {place}, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness. {remaineth: Heb. dwelleth} 17. And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy {place}, until he come out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation of Israel. 18. And he shall go out unto the altar that {is} before the LORD, and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put {it} upon the horns of the altar round about. 19. And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel. 20. And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy {place}, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the live goat: 21. And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send {him} away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness: {a fit...: Heb. a man of opportunity} 22. And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness. {not...: Heb. of separation} 23. And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy {place}, and shall leave them there: 24.

And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar. 26. And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp. 27. And the bullock {for} the sin offering, and the goat {for} the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy {place}, shall {one} carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. 28.

For on that day shall {the priest} make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, {that} ye may be clean from all your sins before the LORD. 31. It {shall be} a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a statute for ever. 32.

      "Gen Z: Leviticus 171. So God like, totally talked to Moses, right? He was all like, 'Yo, Moses, listen up!' 2. Yo, Aaron, his sons, and all y'all Israelites, listen up! God's got a message for you, so pay attention: 3. If any dude from the house of Israel decides to slaughter an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp or outside the camp, 4. If you don't take the offering to the entrance of the place where we all gather to worship the Lord, your actions will be seen as shedding blood. Basically, you'll be kicked out of the community. 5. So that the Israelites can bring their sacrifices, which they do in the open field, and bring them to the LORD, at the entrance of the sacred tent where the meetings take place, to the priest, and offer them as peace offerings to the LORD. 6. The priest gonna spray that blood on the LORD's altar, right by the door of the tabernacle where everyone gathers, then burn that fat to make the LORD happy. 7. And they won't worship those fake idols anymore, because they've been messing around with them. This rule will always apply to them, forever and ever. 8. So, like, when you gotta talk to them, just be like, if there's any dude from the fam of Israel or any outsiders chillin' with you, and they wanna bring some fire offerings or sacrifices, 9. If someone doesn't take their offering to the door of the hangout spot where God is chillin', they're gonna be totally banned from their crew. 10. And if any dude from the gang of Israel, or even a stranger staying in the hood, chows down on any kind of blood, I'll straight up bring the heat on that person and kick them out of the squad. 11. Yo, listen up! Life itself depends on blood, like it's the real deal. And I've totally given it to you to do some soul-cleansing on the altar. Yeah, blood is what really does the trick when it comes to making things right with your soul. 12. So, listen up, peeps of Israel! I'm telling you straight up, none of y'all should be chowing down on that blood. And for all the visitors in your hood, same rules apply - no blood on their plates either. 13. If any dude from the fam of Israel or even any random peeps chilling with us goes out and hunts down some tasty animals or birds, he's gotta pour out the blood and give it a dust covering. Like, keep it clean and respectful, ya know? 14. So, like, the life of all living things is in their blood, you know? That's why I told the kids of Israel not to eat any flesh with the blood still in it. 'Cause, like, the life of all living things is in the blood, man. If anyone goes against that and eats it, they're totally out of the game. 15. If anyone eats something that died on its own or was torn by animals, whether they are from your own community or a stranger, they must wash their clothes, take a shower, and remain unclean until evening. After that, they will be clean. 16. But like, if he doesn't wash or bathe his body, then he's gonna have to take responsibility for his own wrongdoings, you know? \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 171. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2.

And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people: 5. To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them {for} peace offerings unto the LORD. 6. And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 7. And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them throughout their generations. 8. And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man {there be} of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, 9. And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people. 10. And whatsoever man {there be} of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. 11. For the life of the flesh {is} in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it {is} the blood {that} maketh an atonement for the soul. 12. Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. 13. And whatsoever man {there be} of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust. {which...: Heb. that hunteth any hunting} 14. For {it is} the life of all flesh; the blood of it {is} for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh {is} the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off. 15. And every soul that eateth that which died {of itself}, or that which was torn {with beasts, whether it be} one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe {himself} in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean. {that which died...: Heb. a carcase} 16. But if he wash {them} not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity. \n",

Don't do anything inappropriate with your dad's wife – that's just wrong, dude. 9. You can't expose the nudity of your sibling, whether they're your dad's daughter or your mom's daughter, whether they're born in the same house or outside. It's a no-no to reveal their nakedness. 10. Don't go exposing the bodies of your granddaughter or your great-granddaughter. That's just as bad as exposing yourself. Keep it covered! 11. If your dad has a step-daughter from his wife and she's your sister, don't be creeping on her, okay? Keep it respectful and don't expose her nakedness, fam. 12.

Don't be out here revealing the private stuff of a woman and her daughter, and don't be messing around with her granddaughters either. That's her fam, and it's totally not cool. 18. Don't even think about marrying your girl's sister just to annoy her and see her naked, while she's still alive. Like, seriously, don't even go there. Keep it classy, bro. 19. And you better not even think about getting close to a girl and seeing her naked, for as long as she's kept separate due to her impurity. 20. And don't hook up with your neighbor's spouse, it's not cool and totally not worth it. 21. Yo, don't be sacrificing your kids to Molech or disrespecting the name of God, alright? I'm the LORD, just so you know. (BTW, Molech means Moloch in Greek) 22. Don't hook up with guys if you're a guy, it's totally not cool. It's considered like a major no-no. 23. Don't hook up with animals, that's nasty. And no girl should be getting freaky with animals either. It's just all messed up, man. 24. Don't mess yourself up by doing any of these things, because all the other nations messed themselves up and I had to kick them out: 25. And the land is totally messed up: so I'm like, yeah, I'm gonna hold it accountable for all the bad stuff happening and the land itself is just like, 'nope', and throws out all the people living there. 26. So, like, you gotta follow all the rules and laws that I've given you, and you absolutely cannot do any of these disgusting things.

Yo, listen up, cuz the dudes in this land before you totally messed up and did all sorts of messed up things, making the whole place super contaminated and gross. 28. So, like, don't be grossed out, but if you mess up the land by making it dirty and stuff, it might kick you out, just like it did with the previous peeps before you. 29. If anyone does any of these terrible things, even those who do them will be excluded from their community. 30. So make sure to follow my rules, and don't engage in any of these disgusting practices that were done by people before you. Don't taint yourselves with them. I'm the LORD your God.  \n",

You gotta show mad respect to your moms and dads and keep it chill on the sabbaths - I'm the real deal, the LORD your God. 4. Don't get caught up with idols or create your own trendy gods, fam. I'm the OG, the LORD your God. 5. And if you wanna flex by offering a chill sacrifice to the LORD, go for it whenever you feel like it, no pressure. 6. You gotta chow down on that sacrificial offering right away, like, same day and next day. But yo, if there's anything left till the third day, you gotta roast that stuff up in the fire, no leftovers allowed. 7. And like, if you eat it at all on the third day, it's like totally gross and unacceptable, dude. Just no. 8. So, like, if anyone eats that thing, they'll, like, totally be held responsible for their wrongdoing, 'cause they disrespect the sacred thing of the LORD, you know? And that person will totally be kicked out from their gang. 9. When you gather the crops from your land, don't completely take all the crops from the edges of your field, and don't collect every last bit of the harvested crops. 10.

Don't go spreading rumors and gossip amongst your peeps, and don't stand in the way of helping out your neighbor when they're in need. Just a heads-up, I'm the LORD, so you better stay in line. 17. Don't harbor any hate for your bro deep down inside. If you see your neighbor messing up, call them out and help them avoid sin. Don't let sin stick to them, ya feel? 18.

You gotta have fair scales, fair measurements, a fair container, and a fair liquid measure, okay? Because I'm the LORD your God who rescued you from Egypt.

It's because he went and offered his kids to Molech, like straight up defiling my sacred place and disrespecting my holy name. 4. And if the peeps out there totally ignore it when someone sacrifices their child to Molech and don't do anything about it: 5. So, like, I'm totally gonna be super mad at that guy and his whole fam and I'm gonna, like, completely cut them off. And anyone who's, like, following his bad vibes and doing all that shady stuff with Molech, they gotta bounce too from their crew. 6. And if someone starts chasing after people who claim to commune with spirits or practice wizardry, going after them like they're dating, I will personally be totally against that person, and they will be completely excluded from their community. 7. Yo, make yourselves pure and live with mad integrity, 'cause I'm your God, fam. 8. And you gotta follow my rules, like actually do them: I'm the LORD and I make you holy. 9. Anyone who disrespects their parents is seriously in trouble. It's like they're bringing death upon themselves because they've disrespected their own parents. They've got no one to blame but themselves. 10. If a dude cheats with someone else's girl, whether it's his bro's girl or his neighbor's girl, both the cheater and the cheatee gotta face the ultimate consequence - death penalty, no joke! 11. If anyone hooks up with his dad's ex, they're totally exposing their dad's private business. Both of 'em are gonna get straight up eliminated, their actions are on their own heads, no one else's. 12. If a dude hooks up with his ex's daughter, they're both getting wiped out. They totally messed things up and it's all on them, man. 13. If a guy hooks up with another guy like he does with a girl, it's considered totally messed up: they need to face the consequences and it's on them. 14. If a dude marries both a girl and her mom, that's absolutely messed up: they gotta be burned alive, both of them, no exceptions. It's all about keeping things clean and righteous, no wickedness allowed in our crew. 15. If someone engages in intimate relationships with an animal, they will definitely face capital punishment, and the animal involved will also be put to death. 16. If anyone engages in inappropriate relations with an animal, the consequences are severe: both the person and the animal must be put to death. They will face the consequences of their actions, and justice will be served. 17. If a guy ever hooks up with his sister (his dad or mom's daughter) and they start getting all naked together, that's super messed up. People will totally disown them for that, 'cause exposing your sister like that is just not cool. They gotta deal with the consequences of breaking the rules, 'cause that's on them. 18. If a dude hooks up with a girl who's on her period and exposes her nakedness, he's messing with her flow and she's revealing her menstrual cycle. They both gotta be expelled from their community. 19. You can't hook up with your mom's sister or your dad's sister, 'cause that's just getting it on with close family. They'll have to deal with the consequences of their actions, ya know? 20. If a dude hooks up with his uncle's wife, he's exposing his uncle's private stuff. They'll face the consequences and won't have any kids. 21. If a dude starts dating his bro's ex, it's not cool, man. He's breaking the bro code and disrespecting his bro's boundaries. They won't be able to have any kids together. It's just not right, ya know? 22. So, like, make sure you follow all of my rules and do what I say, okay? That way, when you move to the land I'm taking you to, you won't get kicked out or anything. Stay cool, bro. 23. And don't copy the ways of the people I kicked out before you, cause they were doing all sorts of messed up stuff and I couldn't stand them. 24. But yo, listen up fam, I already told y'all that you're gonna get their land and I'm gonna hook you up with it. It's gonna be lit, like a sick spot that's flowing with mad milk and honey. Just remember, I'm the LORD your God, and I've set you apart from all them other peeps out there. 25. So, like, you gotta remember to distinguish between the animals that are considered clean and the ones that are considered unclean, you know? Also, make sure to tell the difference between the birds that are clean and the ones that are unclean. And, like, don't do anything that would make your souls icky or disgusting by messing with any unclean animals, birds, or any of those creepy-crawly things on the ground. Back then, I decided they were unclean, so, yeah. 26. And you gotta be straight up sacred to me: 'cause I, the LORD, am sacred and like, I've totally set you apart from everyone else, so you could be like, totally mine. 27. If anyone, male or female, practices witchcraft or claims to have supernatural powers, they will face severe consequences. They will be subjected to stoning, and their fate will be their own responsibility. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 201. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever {he be} of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth {any} of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones. 3. And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 4. And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: 5. Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people. 6. And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. 7. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I {am} the LORD your God. 8. And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I {am} the LORD which sanctify you. 9. For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood {shall be} upon him. 10. And the man that committeth adultery with {another} man's wife, {even he} that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. 11. And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood {shall be} upon them. 12. And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood {shall be} upon them. 13. If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood {shall be} upon them. 14. And if a man take a wife and her mother, it {is} wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. 15. And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. 16. And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood {shall be} upon them. 17. And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it {is} a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity. 18. And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people. {discovered: Heb. made naked} 19. And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity. {uncovereth: Heb. hath made naked} 20. And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. 21. And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it {is} an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless. {an...: Heb. a separation} 22. Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out. 23. And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. 24. But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I {am} the LORD your God, which have separated you from {other} people. 25. Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean. {creepeth: or, moveth} 26. And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD {am} holy, and have severed you from {other} people, that ye should be mine. 27. A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood {shall be} upon them. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 211. Yo, listen up, Moses. Go talk to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and tell them this: None of them should mess with dead bodies and get themselves defiled among their peeps. 2. But for his squad, like, the fam that's close to him - you know, his mom, dad, sibling, bros and sis, 3. And for his sister, a virgin who is close to him and has not been married, he may choose to be intimate with her. 4. But he shouldn't do anything that goes against his reputation, since he's a well-respected person among his crew. He's gotta keep his dignity intact. (Or ya know, if he's married, he shouldn't do anything that would dishonor himself for his wifey and stuff.) 5. They're not supposed to go bald or shave the edges of their beard or make any cuts on their skin. 6. They gotta be totally dedicated to their God, and never diss their God's name. 'Cause they're the ones bringing the lit offerings to the LORD and munching on that holy bread. So, yeah, they gotta stay super holy. 7. They shouldn't marry someone who is promiscuous or disrespectful, and they shouldn't marry a divorced woman. It's because they are dedicated to serving their God. 8. So, like, you gotta make him all holy and stuff, 'cause he's the one serving up the bread for your God. He's gotta be real sacred to you, 'cause I, the LORD, am the one who makes you all holy and stuff. 9. If a priest's daughter disrespects herself by engaging in promiscuous behavior, she dishonors her father and must face the consequence of being punished by fire. 10. The high priest, you know, the one who got that anointing oil poured on his head and is all set to put on those cool garments, is not allowed to show off his head or rip his clothes, fam. 11. He can't touch dead bodies or defile himself even for his parents; 12. He can't leave the holy place and disrespect the sacredness of his God's sanctuary because he's got the anointing oil on him, representing his special position. I am the LORD. 13. And he's gonna find himself a wifey who's pure as ice. 14. He can't marry a widow, divorced woman, someone who disrespects or a bad girl, but he can marry a virgin from his own crew. 15. He must not disrespect his offspring among his squad, 'cause yo, I, the LORD, gonna bless him. 16. So, God was like, 'Hey Moses, listen up,' 17. Yo Aaron, listen up. If any of your descendants got some flaws, tell 'em to step back and not bring no bread to offer to God. 18. Anyone with imperfections, like being blind, lame, having a flat nose, or any other physical abnormality, should not come forward. 19. Or like, someone who's got a messed up foot or a messed up hand, 20. Or someone with a hunchback or someone who's short, or someone with an eye problem, or someone with a skin condition, or someone with scars, or someone who's had a rough time down there. 21. Dude, anyone who's got any kind of flaw from the family of Aaron, the priest, can't come close to offer the offerings of the LORD that are burned up. If he's got a flaw, he can't come close to offer God's bread, period. 22. He's gonna chow down on God's bread, like the super legit holy stuff and the kinda holy stuff too. 23. Yo, they can't go near the vail or altar if they got any blemish. Gotta keep my sanctuaries holy, 'cause I'm the LORD and I'm the one who makes 'em sacred. 24. So Moses was like, hey Aaron and his sons, and yo all the Israelite peeps, listen up, I got something to tell ya. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 211. And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people: 2. But for his kin, that is near unto him, {that is}, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother, 3. And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no husband; for her may he be defiled. 4. {But} he shall not defile himself, {being} a chief man among his people, to profane himself. {he...: or, being an husband among his people, he shall not defile himself for his wife, etc} 5. They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. 6. They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, {and} the bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy. 7. They shall not take a wife {that is} a whore, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he {is} holy unto his God. 8. Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, {am} holy. 9. And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire. 10. And {he that is} the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 11. Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; 12. Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God {is} upon him: I {am} the LORD. 13. And he shall take a wife in her virginity. 14. A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, {or} an harlot, these shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife. 15. Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do sanctify him. 16. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17. Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever {he be} of thy seed in their generations that hath {any} blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God. {bread: or, food} 18. For whatsoever man {he be} that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing superfluous, 19. Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, 20. Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; {a dwarf: or, too slender} 21. No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. 22. He shall eat the bread of his God, {both} of the most holy, and of the holy. 23. Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them. 24. And Moses told {it} unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 221. Yo, God straight up talked to Moses, like, 2. Yo, Aaron and his sons, listen up! I'm telling ya, keep yourselves away from the sacred stuff of the Israelites. Don't go disrespecting my holy name by messing with the things that are dedicated to me. I'm the LORD, by the way. 3. Tell them that anyone from your crew, no matter which gen they come from, who messes with the sacred stuff that the Israelites dedicate to the LORD while being unclean, will be totally out of my presence. Just so you know, I'm the LORD. 4. If any dude from the Aaron fam is dealing with leprosy or some gross running thing, he can't chow down on holy stuff until he gets himself cleaned up. Also, if anyone touches something dirty because of a dead body or a guy who's got some weird stuff coming out, you gotta stay away too. 5. Like, if you touch some gross creepy creature or come in contact with a dude who's all unclean, whatever kind of unclean stuff he's got going on; 6. If your soul comes in contact with any of these things, you're gonna be unclean until the evening and you can't munch on the holy stuff unless you clean yourself up with some water. 7. And when it's dark outside, he'll be good to go and can eat the sacred stuff as his grub. 8. Don't eat anything that died on its own or was killed by animals, or else you'll make yourself impure. I'm the LORD. 9. So, like, they gotta follow my rules, ya know? Otherwise, they'll take on the sin and end up dead. And if they disrespect it, it's like a major deal, okay? I, the LORD, am the one who makes 'em all sacred and stuff. 10. No random person can munch on the sacred stuff: only a chill non-local friend of the priest, or someone working for them, can snack on the sacred stuff. 11. But if the priest pays for someone's soul with his own cash, he can dig into the grub, as well as those who were born in his crib. They all get a taste of the meal he buys. (BTW, that thing in curly braces means 'with the money he spent on it'). 12. If the priest's daughter gets hitched to someone outside the fam, she can't chow down on the sacred offerings. And by 'someone outside the fam,' I mean some random dude she barely knows. 🚫🍽️ 13. But like, if the priest's daughter becomes single again or gets a divorce, and she doesn't have any kids, and she goes back to live with her dad, just like when she was young, she can totally eat her dad's food, but no random person can eat it. 14. If someone accidentally eats something holy, they should give the priest a fifth of it as compensation. 15. And they shall not disrespect the sacred stuff the Israelites offer to the LORD; 16. Don't let them take on the guilt of doing wrong when they eat sacred things. 'Cause I, the LORD, make them holy. 17. God talked to Moses, like, 18. Yo, Aaron and his homies, listen up! This message goes out to all the peeps in Israel, whether you're part of the fam or just visiting. If you wanna make a dope offering to the LORD, whether it's a promise you made or a freewill offering, here's what you gotta do. 19. You gotta bring a flawless dude from cows, sheep, or goats whenever you feel like it. 20. Yo, anything that's messed up, you can't be bringin' that as an offering 'cause it ain't gonna be cool with the big man upstairs. 21. And if someone wants to bring a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill their vow, or a voluntary offering of cattle or sheep, it has to be flawless and in perfect condition to be accepted; there should be no defects in it. 22. If your animal is blind, injured, disabled, has a weird growth, has a skin condition, or is covered in sores, don't bring it as an offering to the LORD or burn it on the altar! 23. If the animal you're planning to offer as a freewill offering has any extra or missing parts, like a bullock or a lamb, it won't be accepted if it's for a vow. You can also offer a kid instead of a lamb if you want. 24. Don't even think about presenting anything to the LORD that's all banged up, squished, shattered, or sliced. And don't even try making any offerings like that in your turf. 25. Yo, don't even think about offering up some janky bread from some random person to God. That stuff is probably messed up, all full of flaws and imperfections. It ain't gonna pass as good enough for Him, trust me. 26. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,' 27. When a lit bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, comes into the world, it's gotta chill with its mom for a solid seven days. Then on the eighth day and after, it's ready to be lit AF and offered up in fire to the LORD. 28. Yo, don't be slaying both a cow or an ewe and their offspring on the same day, fam. No need to take out the whole fam, ya feel me? And by ewe, I mean a she goat, just so you know. Keep it chill and spread the love, bro. 29. And when you want to give thanks to the LORD, offer it however you want. 30. Eat it all that day, no leftovers till tomorrow. I'm the LORD, FYI. 31. So, like, you gotta follow my commandments and actually do them, you know? I'm the LORD, by the way. 32. Yo, don't disrespect my holy name, yo. I wanna be respected and revered by the whole squad of Israelites, aight? I'm the LORD, I'm the one who makes y'all sacred, ya feel me? 33. That rescued you from Egypt to be your God: I'm the LORD. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 221. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2.

Say unto them, Whosoever {he be} of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I {am} the LORD. 4. What man soever of the seed of Aaron {is} a leper, or hath a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean.

Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 6.

And if a man eat {of} the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth {part} thereof unto it, and shall give {it} unto the priest with the holy thing. 15. And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD; 16. Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them. {suffer...: or, lade themselves with the iniquity of trespass in their eating} 17.

Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever {he be} of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering; 19. {Ye shall offer} at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats. 20. {But} whatsoever hath a blemish, {that} shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you. 21. And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish {his} vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein. {sheep: or, goats} 22. Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD. 23. Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer {for} a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted. {lamb: or, kid} 24. Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make {any offering thereof} in your land. 25. Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption {is} in them, {and} blemishes {be} in them: they shall not be accepted for you. 26. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27. When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 28. And {whether it be} cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day. {ewe: or, she goat} 29. And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer {it} at your own will. 30. On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I {am} the LORD. 31. Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I {am} the LORD. 32.

      "Gen Z: Leviticus 231. So, God starts talking to Moses like, 2. Yo, tell the squad of Israelites that the LORD wants them to know about these lit celebrations, called holy convocations. They're straight up the LORD's parties, fam. 3. Yo, listen up! You gotta hustle for six days straight, but on the seventh day, it's time to chillax and have a lit gathering. No work allowed, bro! This day is all about resting and connecting with the big man upstairs, no matter where you're at in this world. 4. These are the lit celebrations of the LORD, like totally sacred get-togethers, that you gotta announce when the time is right. 5. On the fourteenth day of the first month, when the sun goes down, it's time for the LORD's passover. 6. Yo, listen up fam! On the fifteenth day of the same month, we gotta celebrate the feast of unleavened bread for the LORD. It's gonna be lit for a whole week, so you gotta chow down on that unleavened bread, no cap. 7. On the first day, you gotta have a lit gathering: no adulting allowed, just chillax and enjoy the vibes. 8. But like, for real, you gotta bring some lit fire offering to the Lord for seven days straight. And on the seventh day, it's gonna be totally holy, fam. No working like a slave on that day, okay? 9. And God was like, talking to Moses and stuff, and this is what He said, 10. Yo, listen up, Israel squad! When you finally enter the lit land that I'm hooking you up with and start reaping those juicy crops, make sure you bring a juicy first batch to the priest. It's like the MVP of your harvest, ya feel me? But fo' real, it's all about that omer, aka a handful of blessings! 11. And he's gonna be like, waving that sheaf in front of the LORD, to be like, 'Yo, this is cool with us.' And he gotta do it the day after the sabbath, you know, when the priest does the whole waving thing. 12. On that day, when you lift up the sheaf, you gotta offer a rad lamb, totally flawless and one year old, as a lit sacrifice to the Lord. 13. And the food offering should be two tenths of fine flour mixed with oil, a lit offering for the LORD that's absolutely fire: and the drink offering should be wine, one fourth of a hin. 14. And you won't be munching on bread, roasted grains, or fresh corn until you've made a nice offering to your God. This rule is gonna stick around forever, so make sure you remember it in all the places you call home. 15. And you gotta start counting from the day after the chill sabbath, like when you first made that wave offering with the sheaf. Gotta count seven complete sabbaths, okay? 16. Count fifty days, starting from the day after the seventh sabbath, and bring a fresh offering to the LORD. 17. Yo, take two bomb-a** loaves made with dope flour from your crib. Don't forget to add some leaven to make them legit. These loaves are some next-level offering to the Lord, representing the firstfruits. 18. And you gotta bring seven flawless lambs, only one-year-old, along with a young bull and two rams. They're gonna be like a lit burnt offering to the LORD, with some dope bread, drink, and fire that smells hella good to the LORD. 19. Yo, like sacrifice a goat kid for the sin redemption vibes, and two baby lambs for a chill peace sacrifice. 🐐✌️ 20. And the priest gonna flex them along with the fresh bread, like a lit wave offering to the LORD, with the two lambs: they gotta be straight up holy for the priest, ya feel? 21. And on that same day, you're supposed to make it a special gathering for yourself. Don't do any sort of work that day – it's gonna be a forever rule for all of you, everywhere you live, for all of time. 22. When you're gathering your crops, don't be all like super neat and stuff by clearing out every last bit at the corners of your field. Also, don't snatch up every little leftover piece when you're harvesting. You gotta leave those for the poor and the outsiders in your land. Just so you know, I'm like the LORD, your God, and I'm sayin' this! 23. So, God talked to Moses and was like, 24. Yo, listen up, Israel fam! Come the seventh month, on the first day, it's time to chillax and have a lit Sabbath. We gonna make some noise with the trumpets, and get everyone together for a dope and sacred gathering. 25. Don't do any basic work on that day, but make sure to offer a lit offering to the LORD. 26. Then God texted Moses like, 'Yo dude, listen up!' 27. On the 10th day of the 7th month, there's gonna be a day where we make up for our mistakes. It's gonna be a special and sacred gathering for you guys. You gotta reflect on your actions and bring an offering that we burn up for the LORD. 28. And like, you gotta chill on that day, no hustlin' or anything, 'cause it's like a special day to make things right with the Big Guy upstairs, ya know? 29. If anyone doesn't show sadness on that day, they'll be kicked out of their group. 30. If anyone dares to do any work on that day, they will be totally canceled from the squad. 31. Don't bust a move, fam. This rule is gonna be forever and always, from now 'til forever, wherever you homies chill. 32. It's like a chill day for you, where you can totally take a break and reflect on life. On the ninth day of the month, starting in the evening and going all the way until the next evening, you should embrace this chill day and let your souls feel the good vibes. 33. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,' 34. Yo, Israel, listen up! On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, we're gonna have this lit celebration called the feast of tabernacles. It's gonna go down for a whole week to honor the LORD. So get ready to party, ya'll! 35. On the first day, it's time to gather and chillax: no hustle or grind allowed. 36. For a whole week, you gotta light it up for the LORD with some fire offerings. And on the eighth day, it's gonna be a real epic gathering for you, where you'll keep the fire offerings going strong for the LORD. It's gonna be lit, and make sure you don't do any boring work during that time. It's all about that special day, so no grinding, bro. 37. These are the lit events the Lord wants you to flex on, where you gather up and bring your best game to offer some fire to the Lord. We're talking about lit burnt offerings, dope meat offerings, sacrifices, and drink offerings, all on point and on the right day. 38. In addition to the sacred days of the Lord, and in addition to the stuff you give to Him like your gifts, promises, and voluntary offerings. 39. Yo, on the 15th day of the 7th month, after you've gathered all the dope fruit from the land, it's time to throw a lit feast for the LORD that lasts a whole week! The first day is like a chill Sabbath, and then the eighth day is also a Sabbath. 40. On the first day, get some lit branches from swaggy trees like palm trees, thick trees, and willows from the brook. Then, for a whole week, party it up and show your happiness to the LORD your God. Eyyy! 41. And you gotta turn it into a lit celebration for the big man upstairs, lasting a whole seven days every year. This is gonna be a forever thing that you and your crew gotta keep doing, partying it up in the seventh month. 42. You gotta live in these rad temporary shelters for a whole week, fam. It's like a chill retreat, where every Israelite homie gets in on the vibe and sets up their own cozy booth. 43. So that future peeps know I had the Israel fam crash in tents when I rescued them from Egypt. Just FYI, I'm the real deal, the LORD your God. 44. So Moses told the Israelites about all the lit celebrations approved by the LORD. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 231. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, {Concerning} the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim {to be} holy convocations, {even} these {are} my feasts. 3. Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day {is} the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work {therein}: it {is} the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings. 4. These {are} the feasts of the LORD, {even} holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons. 5. In the fourteenth {day} of the first month at even {is} the LORD'S passover. 6. And on the fifteenth day of the same month {is} the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. 7. In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. 8. But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day {is} an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work {therein}. 9. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 10. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: {sheaf: or, handful: Heb. omer} 11. And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. 12. And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD. 13. And the meat offering thereof {shall be} two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD {for} a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof {shall be} of wine, the fourth {part} of an hin. 14. And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: {it shall be} a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 15. And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete: 16. Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD. 17. Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; {they are} the firstfruits unto the LORD. 18. And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be {for} a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, {even} an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD. 19. Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. 20. And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits {for} a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest. 21. And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, {that} it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work {therein: it shall be} a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations. 22. And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I {am} the LORD your God. 23. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the first {day} of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation. 25. Ye shall do no servile work {therein}: but ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 26. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 27. Also on the tenth {day} of this seventh month {there shall be} a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 28. And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it {is} a day of atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God. 29. For whatsoever soul {it be} that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from among his people. 30. And whatsoever soul {it be} that doeth any work in that same day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people. 31. Ye shall do no manner of work: {it shall be} a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 32. It {shall be} unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth {day} of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath. {celebrate: Heb. rest} 33. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 34. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month {shall be} the feast of tabernacles {for} seven days unto the LORD. 35. On the first day {shall be} an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work {therein}. 36. Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it {is} a solemn assembly; {and} ye shall do no servile work {therein}. {solemn...: Heb. day of restraint} 37. These {are} the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim {to be} holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing upon his day: 38. Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the LORD. 39. Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the first day {shall be} a sabbath, and on the eighth day {shall be} a sabbath. 40. And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days. {boughs of goodly trees: Heb. fruit of, etc} 41. And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. {It shall be} a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall celebrate it in the seventh month. 42. Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in booths: 43. That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I {am} the LORD your God. 44. And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 241. So, the Almighty was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,' 2. Yo, tell the Israelites to bring you some legit extra virgin olive oil, like real quality stuff, for the lighting of the lamps. We want those flames to be burning non-stop, like always lit. #litlamps 3. Aaron gotta keep that testimony flowing in the tabernacle, no hiding anything. He gotta do it from evening 'til morning, non-stop, always in the presence of the LORD. This rule gonna last for generations, no changing it, ever. 4. He will make sure the lights are always on fleek on that lit candle holder in front of the LORD. 5. And you're gonna grab some fancy flour and bake twelve cakes with it. Each cake will have two tenths of a deal in it. 6. And you're gonna arrange them in two rows, with six in each row, on the clean table in front of the LORD. 7. And you gotta sprinkle some dope frankincense on each row, so it's all lit on the bread as a commemoration, like a sick offering to the LORD. 8. Every weekend he's gotta make sure it's all good in front of the LORD, no breaks, like forever, 'cause it's a promise to the children of Israel. 9. So, like, this food is totally for Aaron and his sons. They gotta eat it in the super holy place 'cause it's like the most holy thing ever. It's one of those offerings that the LORD made with fire, and it's like a forever rule. 10. So there was this dude, right, whose mom was from Israel, but his dad was Egyptian. He hangs out with the Israelites and starts beefing with another Israelite guy in the camp. 11. So, this Israelite dude straight up started dissing the name of the LORD and hurling curses left and right. People were like, 'Nah, we can't let this slide,' and took him to Moses for some serious talk. Oh, by the way, this dude's mom's name is Shelomith and she's from the tribe of Dan, in case you were wondering. 12. So they kept him in custody, to understand what the LORD wanted to reveal. {to expound unto them according to the mouth of the LORD: Hebrew: to explain to them according to what the LORD had spoken} 13. So, God starts talking to Moses, like, for real, 14. Drag that person who cursed outside the hangout spot, and have everyone who witnessed it put their hands on their head, and then have the whole squad throw rocks at them. 15. Yo, listen up, Israel fam. Check it, if anyone disses our God, they gotta own up to their own mess. 16. If someone disrespects the name of the LORD, they're gonna face serious consequences. The whole crew's gonna come together and stone 'em, whether they're a local or an outsider. Non-negotiable, disrespecting the LORD's name leads to death. 17. If someone takes another person's life, they will definitely face the consequences and be given the death penalty. {smiteth...: Hebrew: strike the life of a person} 18. If someone kills an animal, they must make restitution, giving up another animal in return. It's a life for a life. 19. So if someone messes up their friend's vibe, they gotta experience the same mess in return. 20. If someone wrongs you, get back at them in a fair and equivalent way. Just like they messed with someone, they should be messed with in return. 21. If someone takes the life of an animal, they must make restitution for it; but if someone takes the life of a human, they will face the penalty of death. 22. You all gotta follow the same set of rules, whether you're from outta town or born and raised here. 'Cause I'm the LORD your God, and that's how we roll. 23. So Moses was like, yo guys, we gotta drag out this dude who was straight-up cursing and stone him with some serious rocks outside the camp. And the Israelite peeps were like, word, we'll do just what the LORD told Moses. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 241. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually. {to cause: Heb. to cause to ascend} 3. Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: {it shall be} a statute for ever in your generations. 4. He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually. 5. And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake. 6. And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD. 7. And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon {each} row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, {even} an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 8. Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, {being taken} from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant. 9. And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it {is} most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute. 10. And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father {was} an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish {woman} and a man of Israel strove together in the camp; 11. And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name {of the LORD}, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name {was} Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:) 12. And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed them. {that...: Heb. to expound unto them according to the mouth of the LORD} 13. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 14. Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard {him} lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him. 15. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. 16. And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, {and} all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name {of the LORD}, shall be put to death. 17. And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death. {killeth...: Heb. smiteth the life of a man} 18. And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast. {beast for...: Heb. life for life} 19. And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him; 20. Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him {again}. 21. And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death. 22. Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I {am} the LORD your God. 23. And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 251. So, like, God totally talked to Moses on mount Sinai and said, 2. Yo, listen up, fam! God's got a message for the Israelites. When you finally reach the land He's givin' you, that place gotta take a break, chillax, and give the Lord a day of rest. #Respect 3. You gotta work the land and take care of your plants for six good years to get a bountiful harvest. 4. But yo, on the seventh year it's gonna be a chill day for the land, a chill day dedicated to the LORD. You gotta lay off your crops and vines, no planting or trimming allowed. 5. You can't harvest any crops that grow on their own from your field, and don't pick any unripe grapes from your vineyard either. It's a year of rest for the land, so let everything grow naturally.  6. The chill day of rest, y'all can grub on the produce of the land. It's all good for you, your crew, even those who work for you, and any visitors kickin' it with you. 7. And for your animals, and for the creatures that are in your land, all the growth will be their food. 8. So like, you gotta count seven sets of seven years, which equals forty-nine years. It's kinda like a cycle, ya know? 9. Yo, on the tenth of the seventh month, when it's time for atonement, blast the epic jubilant trumpet sound all over your land. It's gonna be LIT! 🎺💥 10. Yo, listen up! The fiftieth year is gonna be lit! You gotta make it special, like, holy and stuff. Spread the word across the land that everyone's free and can do their own thing. It's gonna be a total celebration, you know? Everyone goes back to their own land and reunites with their fam. How dope is that? 11. That fiftieth year shall be a total vibe for you: you gotta take a break from planting, harvesting whatever grows on its own, and picking those fresh grapes from your vine without getting it all neat and tidy. 12. Yo, it's time for the jubile, fam! It's gonna be lit and all holy vibes, ya know? You can totally feast on the bountiful harvest straight from the fields. No cap! 13. When the year of celebration comes around, everyone gotta go back and get what's rightfully theirs. 14. And if you sell something to your friend, or buy something from your friend, you must not be unfair to each other: 15. Yo, check it out, when it comes to buying stuff from your neighbor after the jubile, you gotta consider the years they've been holding onto it. And when they sell you their goods, the number of years they've been growing those fruits matters, yo! 16. As time goes on, the value will go up if it's been around for a while, but if it's still new, the price will be lower. The price is based on how many good years it has left, so that's what you're paying for. 17. So, like, don't be all mean and stuff to each other, okay? But like, respect your God and be all afraid and stuff because I'm the LORD, your God, you know? 18. So, like, make sure you follow my rules, keep them in mind, actually do them, and then you'll have peaceful vibes while living in this land. 19. And the earth will totally come through with its bounty, and you'll feast on your favorite foods, and chillax in safety within its realms. 20. And like, if y'all are like, 'Yo, what are we gonna munch on in the seventh year? Like, we can't even plant or harvest our crops anymore, bruh:' 21. Yo, I'm about to drop a major blessing on you in year six, and it's gonna keep the good vibes flowing for three whole years, producing mad fruit! 22. And in the eighth year, you shall plant crops and still enjoy the leftover harvest until the ninth year. Until the new fruits come in, you can feast on the previous year's stock. 23. Yo, the land is off limits for sale forever, cuz it belongs to me. Just a reminder, y'all are like visitors and travelers hangin' out with me. 24. And you gotta give back the land in all the areas you own, okay? 25. Yo, if your bro is, like, super broke and had to sell some of his stuff, and if any of his fam wants to buy it back, then they should totally do it, man. Gotta help your brother out and make sure he gets back what he had to sell. 26. And if the dude doesn't have anyone to hook him up, but he's got the means to do it himself, he's gotta step up and handle it all on his own. 27. Yo, like, if someone sold something and later realizes they made an extra profit, they gotta figure out how many years passed and give that extra cash back to the person they sold it to. So, they can get their thing back and return to owning it. 28. But if he can't give it back, then what he sold will stay with the person who bought it until the year of jubilee. When the jubilee comes, it will be released, and he will get his property back. 29. If someone sells a house in a city with walls, they have the right to buy it back within a year after selling it. They've got a whole year to make the redemption happen. 30. And if it's not bought back within a whole year, then the house in the city with walls shall belong forever to the person who purchased it for all their descendants. It won't be released during the jubilee. 31. So, like, the villages without walls, they're gonna be treated like fields in the countryside. You can totally buy them back and the peeps living there get to leave in this rad celebration called jubile. It's like, their redemption, ya know? 32. Like, the Levites can totally buy back their cities whenever, you know, and their houses in those cities too. 33. If someone buys a house from the Levites, that house and the city it's in will be returned in the year of jubilee. The cities of the Levites are their property among the Israelites. 34. But like, they can't sell the land around their cities, man! It's, like, their forever property and stuff. 35. And yo, if your bro is broke and struggling alongside you, then you gotta help him out, even if he's a total stranger or just passing through. The goal is to give him a chance to thrive with you. Handd failin' and all that) And when I say help, I mean like lift him up, empower him, ya know? 36. Don't charge interest or make extra profit from someone, but respect your God so that your fellow brother can thrive alongside you. 37. Don't be charging interest when you loan money to your homie, and don't be expecting a profit when you lend them food. 38. I'm like your ultimate big boss, the one who saved you from Egypt and hooked you up with the land of Canaan, all so I can be your forever God. 39. And if your bro who lives near you ends up being broke and sells himself to you, you can't force him to be your servant forever. You gotta treat him like a homie, not a servant. 40. But like a part-time worker or someone crashing at your place, he'll be with you and help you out until the jubilee year comes around. 41. And then he'll bounce from your life, him and his squad, and go back to his fam, inheritin' the legacy of his ancestors. 42. They're like my squad, the ones I rescued from Egypt. No way I'm letting them be sold off as slaves. No way I'm about that slave trade vibe. 43. Don't be a total control freak over someone; just respect and fear your God. 44. You will have slaves from the neighboring nations; they will be your male and female servants, and you can acquire them by purchasing. 45. Also, if there are any cool kids from other countries hanging out with you, you can totally buy them and their families who have been born in your land. They'll be your squad for real. 46. And you'll pass them down to your kids as an inheritance, so they can possess them. They'll be your servants forever. But don't treat your fellow Israelites harshly by ruling over them with force. 47. If a foreigner or someone new to the city becomes successful because of you, and your friend who lives nearby becomes poor and has to sell themselves to the foreigner or new person in the area, or to the relatives of that foreigner:  48. Once he's been sold, there's a chance for him to be bought back; one of his own family members can be the one to buy him back:  49. His uncle or his cousin can help him out, or any close relative from his family can step in to help him out; or if he's able, he can even help himself out. 50. And the person who purchased him shall calculate the time from when he was sold until the year of jubilee, and the price of his purchase shall be based on the number of years, similar to what a hired worker would earn during that time. 51. If there's still a bunch of years left, he's gotta cough up the cash to buy back his freedom, equal to the original price he was sold for. 52. And if there's only a few years left until the year of jubile, then the person should tally it up and pay back the value of their release based on their remaining years. 53. And he'll work for him like a part-time gig worker, but the boss can't be all controlling and strict in front of you. 54. And if he hasn't been freed during these years, then he'll be released during the year of jubile, along with his squad of children. By the way, this is how it's gonna go down. 55. So, like, the deal is, the children of Israel are totally my squad. They're my true ride-or-dies that I rescued from Egypt, you know? And hey, just so you know, I'm the big boss in charge here - I'm the LORD, your God. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 251. And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD. {keep: Heb. rest} 3. Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 4. But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard. 5. That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: {for} it is a year of rest unto the land. {of thy vine...: Heb. of thy separation} 6. And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee, 7. And for thy cattle, and for the beast that {are} in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat. 8. And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years. 9. Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth {day} of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land. {of the jubile: Heb. loud of sound} 10. And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout {all} the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family. 11. A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather {the grapes} in it of thy vine undressed. 12. For it {is} the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field. 13. In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his possession. 14. And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest {ought} of thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another: 15. According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, {and} according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee: 16. According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for {according} to the number {of the years} of the fruits doth he sell unto thee. 17. Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I {am} the LORD your God. 18. Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. 19. And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. 20. And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 21. Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years. 22. And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat {yet} of old fruit until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat {of} the old {store}. 23. The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land {is} mine; for ye {are} strangers and sojourners with me. {for ever: or, to be quite cut off: Heb. for cutting off} 24. And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land. 25. If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away {some} of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold. 26. And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it; {himself...: Heb. his hand hath attained and found sufficiency} 27. Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession. 28. But if he be not able to restore {it} to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession. 29. And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; {within} a full year may he redeem it. 30. And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that {is} in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubile. 31. But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile. {they may...: Heb. redemption belongeth unto it} 32. Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, {and} the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. 33. And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in {the year of} jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites {are} their possession among the children of Israel. {a man...: or, one of the Levites redeem them} 34. But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it {is} their perpetual possession. 35. And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: {yea, though he be} a stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee. {fallen...: Heb. his hand faileth} {relieve: Heb. strengthen} 36. Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee. 37. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase. 38. I {am} the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, {and} to be your God. 39. And if thy brother {that dwelleth} by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant: {compel...: Heb. serve thyself with him with the service, etc} 40. {But} as an hired servant, {and} as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, {and} shall serve thee unto the year of jubile: 41. And {then} shall he depart from thee, {both} he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return. 42. For they {are} my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen. {as...: Heb. with the sale of a bondman} 43. Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God. 44. Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, {shall be} of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. 45. Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that {are} with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession. 46. And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit {them for} a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour. {they...: Heb. ye shall serve yourselves with them} 47. And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother {that dwelleth} by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger {or} sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family: {wax rich...: Heb. his hand obtain, etc} 48. After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him: 49. Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or {any} that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself. 50. And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him. 51. If {there be} yet many years {behind}, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for. 52. And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall count with him, {and} according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption. 53. {And} as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: {and the other} shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight. 54. And if he be not redeemed in these {years}, then he shall go out in the year of jubile, {both} he, and his children with him. {in these...: or, by these means} 55. For unto me the children of Israel {are} servants; they {are} my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I {am} the LORD your God. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 261. Don't make any idols or statues, don't even think about setting up some fancy stone image in your territory, and definitely don't worship it. I'm the LORD your God, so just chill and show some respect. 2. Yo, you gotta keep my sabbaths and show respect to my sanctuary. I'm the LORD, no cap. 3. If you follow my rules, and obey my commands, and actually do them; 4. And I'll make it rain when it's supposed to, and the land's gonna produce a ton of crops, and the trees in the fields are gonna bear mad fruit, dude! 5.

Like, seriously, five of you will totally go after a hundred and, like, a hundred of you will totally own ten thousand in battle.

Because I'll totally have your back, and help you thrive, and let your squad grow, and solidify my covenant with you. 10. And y'all can totally feast on the nostalgic goodies, and flex your retro style together with the fresh and trendy ones. 11. And I'll totally set up my hangout spot right in your midst: and trust me, I won't even be remotely disgusted by you. 12. And I'll be chillin' with y'all, bein' your God, and you'll be my squad. 13. I'm the LORD your God, the one who set you free from Egypt so you wouldn't be slaves anymore. I've smashed your chains and made you walk tall. 14. But, like, if you don't listen to me and refuse to follow all these rules; 15. And like, if you totally diss my rules or if your soul is like totally grossed out by my judgments, and you're like, 'Nah, I'm not gonna follow all of your commandments,' and you end up breaking my covenant... 16. I'mma bring some serious chaos your way, like straight up terror, sickness, and fever that's gonna mess with your vision and make your hearts heavy with sadness. And on top of that, when you try to plant your crops, it's gonna be a total waste 'cause your enemies gonna swoop in and eat 'em all. 17. And I'll be totally against you, so you're like, totally doomed to be defeated by your enemies. The people who legit can't stand you will totally be in charge, and you'll freak out and run away when there's actually no one chasing you. 18. And if you still refuse to listen to me, then I'm gonna have to dish out seven times the consequences for your mistakes. 19. And I'll totally bring down your ego and make your dreams feel unattainable, while your world feels like a solid block of metal and your surroundings become as hard as shiny brass: 20. And all the effort you put in will be for nothing: because your land won't produce any crops, and the trees won't bear any fruits. 21. But if you like, totally go against me and ignore what I'm saying, then brace yourself for some major consequences. I'm talking about seven times the amount of troubles coming your way, straight up karma for all the wrong things you've done. 22. I'm gonna let loose some savage creatures on you, who will snatch away your lil' ones, wreck your livestock, and seriously thin out your crew. Your usual paths are gonna be deserted. 23. And if you don't wanna get your act together despite everything I've been tryna teach you, but instead insist on going against me; 24. If you keep messing up, I'll definitely come at you with consequences, like, seven times worse for all your wrongdoings. 25. And I'll bring in some serious heat that'll totally take revenge on all the drama going against our agreement. Once you all gather up in your cities, I'll send some major sickness vibes your way, and you'll end up being handed over to your enemies. 26. And when your bread stash runs out, there will be a squad of ten ladies baking your bread in a super-oven. They'll even measure it out for you! But guess what? You'll chow down on it, and you still won't be full. Like, seriously, can't even get satisfied. 27. If you straight up don't listen to me after all this, but instead choose to go against what I'm saying; 28. I'll totally be ticked off and give you a taste of my discipline if you keep going against me. Like, for real, I'll make sure you pay for your wrongs seven times over. 29. And you'll chow down on your sons' and daughters' flesh. 30. And I'm gonna wreck your fancy hangouts, demolish your statues, and throw your lifeless bodies on top of your worthless idols. Gotta say, my soul's gonna totally despise you. 31. And I'm gonna totally trash your cities, leave your holy places in ruins, and I won't even appreciate the sweet smells you're offering. 32. And I'm gonna make the land all empty and abandoned, and the peeps who have beef with you are gonna be super shook when they see it. 33. I'm gonna like totally disperse you among all these people who aren't down with our beliefs, and I'll send this sword-wielding trouble your way. Your homeland will be a ghost town and your cities will be ruins. 34. Once the land is left deserted and you guys are stuck in your enemies' territory, that's when the land can finally have some downtime and chill out, enjoying its sabbaths. 35. While it's all abandoned, it'll chill out and recharge because it never took a break during your chill days when you were living there. 36. For those of you who survive, I'm gonna make your enemies so freakin' scared that they get weak in the knees. Just the sound of a leaf rustling will make 'em run like they're being chased by a sword. And even when no one's after 'em, they'll stumble and fall. 37. And they'll start tripping over each other, like, out of nowhere, man... And you won't stand a chance against your enemies, no matter how hard you try. 38. And like, you're totally gonna get wiped out by the non-believers, and your enemies are gonna totally devour your land. 39. And those of you who survive will suffer the consequences of your wrongdoing in the territories of your enemies; just like your ancestors, you will also bear the burden of their past wrongdoings. 40. If they own up to their wrongs, including the wrongs of their ancestors, and admit the ways they've messed up and rebelled against me; 41. So like, I totally went against them and made them end up in their enemies' land. But, if they are willing to humble themselves and actually admit they messed up, then I'll be cool with punishing them for their wrongdoings. 42. I'll totally remember the promises I made to Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham, and I'll also remember the land I promised them, no doubt! 43. Yo, the land's gonna be abandoned by them and get a break by observing her sabbaths while she's empty without them. They gotta face the consequences of their wrongdoing cuz they straight up disrespected my laws and hated my commandments. 44. And even though they might find themselves in enemy territory, I won't abandon them or despise them so much that I wipe them out and break my promise with them. 'Cause I'm still the LORD their God. 45. But yo, I got mad love for their ancestors, who I brought out of Egypt in front of all those other nations, just so I could be their God. I'm the LORD, no doubt. 46. Here's the deal: These are the rules and regulations that the LORD established, right on Mount Sinai through Moses, for the children of Israel. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 261. Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a standing image, neither shall ye set up {any} image of stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I {am} the LORD your God. {standing...: or, pillar} {image of...: or, figured stone: Heb. a stone of picture} 2. Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I {am} the LORD. 3. If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; 4. Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 5. And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely. 6. And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make {you} afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land. {rid: Heb. cause to cease} 7. And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword. 8. And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 9. For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you. 10. And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new. 11. And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you. 12. And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people. 13. I {am} the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright. 14. But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments; 15. And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, {but} that ye break my covenant: 16. I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it. {over: Heb. upon} 17. And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you. 18. And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. 19. And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass: 20. And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits. 21. And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. {contrary...: or, at all adventures with me} 22. I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your {high} ways shall be desolate. 23. And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; 24. Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins. 25. And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of {my} covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy. 26. {And} when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver {you} your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. 27. And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me; 28. Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins. 29. And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat. 30. And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. 31. And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. 32. And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it. 33. And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. 34. Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye {be} in your enemies' land; {even} then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths. 35. As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 36. And upon them that are left {alive} of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth. {shaken: Heb. driven} 37. And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. 38. And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up. 39. And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them. 40. If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me; 41. And {that} I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 42. Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land. 43. The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. 44. And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I {am} the LORD their God. 45. But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I {am} the LORD. 46. These {are} the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses. \n",
      "Gen Z: Leviticus 271. God was like, yo Moses, listen up! 2. Yo, listen up, peeps of Israel! If a dude decides to make a super specific promise, those people involved gotta be dedicated to the LORD, and you gotta figure out their worth. 3. And you gotta set a value for guys between 20 and 60 years old, and that value is gonna be 50 shekels of silver, just like the ones they use at the holy place. 4. And if it's a female, then you should value it at thirty shekels. 5. If it's someone between the ages of five and twenty, you gotta pay twenty shekels for a guy and ten shekels for a girl, no cap. 6. If the person is between one month and five years old, you should estimate their worth at five silver shekels if they're male, and three silver shekels if they're female. 7. And if someone is 60 years old or older, and they're a dude, you gotta pay 'em 15 shekels. But if they're a lady, it's just 10 shekels, yo. 8. But like, if he's, you know, not as rich as you thought, then he has to go meet the priest and the priest will evaluate him. The priest will assign a value to him based on how much he can actually afford to give. 9. And if it's an animal that people offer to the LORD, anything that anyone gives from that animal to the LORD will be sacred. 10. He can't switch or swap it, trading something good for something bad, or something bad for something good. And if he does decide to exchange one animal for another, then both the animal and the swap are considered sacred. 11. And if it's some kind of unclean animal that they don't offer as a sacrifice to the LORD, then they gotta bring the animal to the priest: 12. The priest has to give it a fair assessment, whether it's excellent or not so great. Whatever value the priest assigns to it, that's how it's gonna be. So basically, the priest's opinion is what really matters here. 13. But if he actually wants to buy it back, then he has to pay an extra 20% of its value. 14. Yo, when a person decides to make their crib all holy for the Lord, the priest gotta come over and check it out. They'll evaluate if it's lit or not, and whatever the priest determines, that's how it's gonna roll. 15. And if the one who made it sacred wants to buy back his house, he has to pay an additional fifth of the money you valued it at, and then it becomes his again. 16. If someone sets apart a portion of their land as an offering to the LORD, the value of it should be based on the amount of seed it can produce. For example, if it can yield enough barley seed to measure a homer, it would be valued at fifty shekels of silver. (By the way, a homer is a unit of measurement for land.) 17. If someone sets apart their field until the year of celebration, according to your assessment, it should remain untouched. 18. But if he sets apart his field after the jubile, then the priest will calculate the cash based on the remaining years until the next jubile, and it will be deducted from the total value. 19. And if the person who set aside the field wants to buy it back, they must pay an additional 20% of the appraised value, making it officially theirs. 20. And if he doesn't want to buy back the land, or if he has already sold the land to someone else, it can't be bought back again. 21. But yo, when that field bounces in the jubile, it be straight up sacred for the LORD, like a totally devoted field; the priest be owning that shiz. 22. And if someone dedicates a field they have purchased to the LORD, but it's not part of their own land, 23. The priest will calculate how much you're worth until the year of jubilee. On that day, he'll give your value as a sacred offering to the LORD. 24. During the year of jubile, the field will go back to the original owner, the one who originally owned the land. 25. And like, all your calculations gotta be based on the sacred shekel, you know? Like, twenty gerahs will make up one shekel. 26. You can't dedicate any firstborn animals as an offering to the Lord. Whether it's an ox or a sheep, it belongs to the Lord as his firstborn. 27. And if it's like, a nasty animal or whatever, then you gotta like, buy it back based on how much it's worth, and throw in an extra fifth as a bonus: or if you don't buy it back, then you can sell it for how much it's worth. 28. Yo, listen up! Any item, whether it's a human or an animal or something from your property, that's dedicated to the LORD can't be sold or bought back. It's considered super sacred and belongs solely to the LORD. 29. Any person who is declared devoted cannot be bought back; they must be put to death. 30. Like, all the tithe stuff from the land, whether it's from the seeds or the fruits of the trees, belongs to the LORD. It's legit super sacred to Him. 31. And if someone wants to redeem any of their tithes, they should add an extra 20% to it. 32. When it comes to givin' a tenth of your animal herd or flock - any critter that goes under the rod - that tenth is gonna be set apart for the LORD, all sacred and stuff. 33. He won't overthink whether it's a vibe or not, and he won't try to tweak it. But if he does decide to make a change, both the original and the new version will be super legit; it can't be reversed or cancelled. 34. Yo, peep this, these are the rules that the LORD dropped on Moses for the Israel squad straight up at mount Sinai. \n",
      "KJV: Leviticus 271. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons {shall be} for the LORD by thy estimation. 3. And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 4. And if it {be} a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels. 5. And if {it be} from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 6. And if {it be} from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation {shall be} three shekels of silver. 7. And if {it be} from sixty years old and above; if {it be} a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels. 8. But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him. 9. And if {it be} a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that {any man} giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy. 10. He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy. 11. And if {it be} any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest: 12. And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, {who art} the priest, so shall it be. {as...: Heb. according to thy estimation, O priest, etc} 13. But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth {part} thereof unto thy estimation. 14. And when a man shall sanctify his house {to be} holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand. 15. And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth {part} of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his. 16. And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD {some part} of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed {shall be valued} at fifty shekels of silver. {an...: or, the land of an homer, etc} 17. If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand. 18. But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation. 19. And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth {part} of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him. 20. And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. 21. But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest's. 22. And if {a man} sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which {is} not of the fields of his possession; 23. Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, {even} unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, {as} a holy thing unto the LORD. 24. In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, {even} to him to whom the possession of the land {did belong}. 25. And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel. 26. Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD'S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether {it be} ox, or sheep: it {is} the LORD'S. {firstling of: Heb. firstborn, etc} 27. And if {it be} of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem {it} according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth {part} of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation. 28. Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, {both} of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing {is} most holy unto the LORD. 29. None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; {but} shall surely be put to death. 30. And all the tithe of the land, {whether} of the seed of the land, {or} of the fruit of the tree, {is} the LORD'S: {it is} holy unto the LORD. 31. And if a man will at all redeem {ought} of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth {part} thereof. 32. And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, {even} of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD. 33. He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed. 34. These {are} the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 11. So, the big man upstairs talked to Moses while they were chillin' in the middle of nowhere (specifically the Sinai wilderness), inside the meeting place tent, on the first day of the second month, during the second year after they dipped from Egypt. And here's what He had to say... 2. Yo, gather up the whole crew of Israelites, y'know, count 'em all by their fams and their dads' houses, and tally up their names, like each dude countin' off. 3. All the dudes in Israel who are 20 or older and capable of joining the battle—y'all gotta be counted up by you and Aaron, army style. 4. And, like, you gotta have a representative dude from each tribe, you know? Each one being the top dog of their own family, man. 5. So, these are the dudes who got your back: Reuben's crew, you got Elizur, Shedeur's kid. 6. Simeon's crew: Shelumiel, the offspring of Zurishaddai, holding it down. 7. In the tribe of Judah, there was Nahshon, Amminadab's offspring. 8. Issachar squad representin' with Nethaneel, Zuar's son. 9. Representing Zebulun, we have Eliab, Helon's son. 10. From the Joseph fam: for Ephraim, it's Elishama, Ammihud's kid. And for Manasseh, it's Gamaliel, Pedahzur's offspring. 11. Representing Benjamin, we've got Abidan, cool kid and offspring of Gideoni. 12. Dan's crew includes Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai. 13. Yo, Asher had this dude named Pagiel, son of Ocran. 14. This dude Gad had a son named Eliasaph, whose other name was Deuel (or Reuel, if you wanna be fancy). 15. For Naphtali, there was Ahira, Enan's kid. 16. These were the total legends of the crew, straight-up bosses of their family tribes, leaders of massive squads in Israel. 17. So Moses and Aaron took these dudes, and I'm about to drop their names for you: 18. So, like, everyone came together on the first day of the second month, right? And they started sharing all their family history and stuff, you know, their whole ancestry. They did it all based on their dads' side of the family, you know, counting everyone who was at least twenty years old. It was like a whole big headcount thing, you know? 19. Just like how God told Moses, he counted them in the middle of nowhere at Sinai. 20. And the kids of Reuben, Israel's OG son, organized by their fams, all based on their dads' crib, counting them up by name and ID, only including the dudes who were twenty or older, ready to go out and fight in battle; 21. So, like, the peeps from the tribe of Reuben, there were like, um, 46,500 of them, ya know? 22. So, like, for the Simeonites, they were counted and stuff, based on their families and stuff, you know? Like, the dudes who were counted were like, all the guys who were like 20 years old and older and ready to go to war and stuff. Oh, and they were counted like, individually, by their names and everything. 23. So, like, the peeps from the tribe of Simeon, their total came to fifty-nine thousand and three hundred. Can you believe it? 24. In the fam of Gad, based on their fam history, their dads' crew decide how many peeps of fighting age there were, starting from twenty and up, ready to join the battle squad. 25. Yo, the tribe of Gad had a total of 45,650 people in their count. 26. So, like, the peeps from the tribe of Judah, sorted by their fams and stuff, based on their dad's crib and the count of their names, dude, starting from 20 years old and older, all the ones ready to hit the battlefield, you know? 27. The peeps from the tribe of Judah had a total of 74.6K heads counted. 28. This is the deal with the Issachar fam: counting all the fam members by their generations, families, and their dads' houses. We only counting peeps who are at least 20 years old and can handle themselves in a war. So basically, only the warriors are getting counted. 29. There were, like, 54,400 peeps from the tribe of Issachar. 30. So, this is the deal: The dudes from the tribe of Zebulun - we're talking about their fam and all - were counted, ya know? They were like 20 years old and older, ready to go into battle. They numbered 'em all and everything, based on their names and their dads' houses. 31. The peeps from the Zebulun tribe were a solid 57,400 deep when they got counted. 32. From the crew of Joseph, specifically the offspring of Ephraim, sorted by their bloodlines, organized by their family units and patriarchal homes, counting all the individuals who were twenty years or older, and capable of joining the battle ranks; 33. There were like 40K and 500 of the squad from the Ephraim tribe, you know? 34. So, like, of the peeps from the fam of Manasseh, counting all the descendants and their fams, based on the dads' lineages, and like, the total number of peeps who were like, 20 years old and older, and were ready to, you know, fight in battle; 35. So, like, there were a total of 32,200 peeps from the tribe of Manasseh who got counted. 36. Among the peeps of Benjamin, based on their fams and all, by their fams' cribs, counting all those with dope names, from when they turned twenty and older, every one who was ready to throw down in battle; 37. So, like, the people from the tribe of Benjamin, their count was, you know, 35,400. 38. So, like, the peeps from the tribe of Dan, you know, organized and all, based on their fams and stuff, according to how many of them there were who were like a certain age and older, and who was fit for battle and ready to go out there and fight. 39. So, like, the people from the tribe of Dan, there were a total of 62,700 of them, you know? 40. So, like, the dudes from the Asher tribe, they were organized into clans, according to their family line and their dad's house. They counted all the bros who were like at least twenty years old and could join the army and fight and stuff. 41. So, like, there were, um, you know, 41,500 peeps from the tribe of Asher in the count. 42. Yo, check it out. This is about the peeps from the tribe of Naphtali. So, like, throughout all their descendants and families, they were organized based on their dads' houses and all that. And get this, they counted how many people there were who were at least twenty years old and strong enough to join the army. Pretty cool, right? 43. So, like, the people from the tribe of Naphtali, they were, like, 53,400 in total. 44. These are the people that Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel counted - twelve in total, each representing their family. 45. All the peeps of Israel, 20 or older, ready to flex and fight for Israel, were counted by their fams, 46. There were like 603.5K peeps in da count, no cap. 47. But the Levites, following their ancestral tribe, weren't counted among the rest. 48. So, God was like, talking to Moses and was all like, 49. Just don't count the Levi tribe or try to keep track of their numbers among the Israelite kids: 50. But, like, you gotta choose the Levites to be in charge of the super important tabernacle and everything in it. They gotta carry the tabernacle and all its stuff and take care of it. They gotta serve and be totally present for it, and they gotta camp all around the tabernacle, you know? 51. When the tabernacle moves, the Levites got it covered. They take it down when it's time to move, and set it up when it's time to settle. Anybody who tries to mess with it better watch out, because they'll be dealt with. 52. So, like, the Israelites gotta set up their tents, right? Each person chillin' in their own spot, stickin' to their own crew, with their own flag and all. They gotta do this in their cool squads and set up camp wherever they roll. 53. Yo, so here's the deal: the Levites gotta set up shop all around the tabernacle of testimony, making sure the whole Israelite crew stays on God's good side and avoids any divine anger. They're responsible for holding it down and taking care of everything in the tabernacle of testimony. Righteous, right? 54. And the Israel fam totally followed everything the LORD told Moses. They were like, 'we got you, homie.' \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 11. And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first {day} of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 2. Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers, with the number of {their} names, every male by their polls; 3. From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by their armies. 4. And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one head of the house of his fathers. 5.

And they assembled all the congregation together on the first {day} of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, by their polls. 19. As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the wilderness of Sinai. 20. And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls, every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 21. Those that were numbered of them, {even} of the tribe of Reuben, {were} forty and six thousand and five hundred. 22.

Those that were numbered of them, {even} of the tribe of Zebulun, {were} fifty and seven thousand and four hundred. 32. Of the children of Joseph, {namely}, of the children of Ephraim, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 33. Those that were numbered of them, {even} of the tribe of Ephraim, {were} forty thousand and five hundred. 34. Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 35. Those that were numbered of them, {even} of the tribe of Manasseh, {were} thirty and two thousand and two hundred. 36. Of the children of Benjamin, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 37. Those that were numbered of them, {even} of the tribe of Benjamin, {were} thirty and five thousand and four hundred. 38. Of the children of Dan, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 39. Those that were numbered of them, {even} of the tribe of Dan, {were} threescore and two thousand and seven hundred. 40. Of the children of Asher, by their generations, after their families, by the house of their fathers, according to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war; 41. Those that were numbered of them, {even} of the tribe of Asher, {were} forty and one thousand and five hundred. 42.

Those that were numbered of them, {even} of the tribe of Naphtali, {were} fifty and three thousand and four hundred. 44. These {are} those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron numbered, and the princes of Israel, {being} twelve men: each one was for the house of his fathers. 45. So were all those that were numbered of the children of Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel; 46. Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 47. But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not numbered among them. 48. For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying, 49. Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel: 50. But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that {belong} to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. 51. And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 52. And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. 53. But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony. 54. And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 21. So like, God was all, 'Yo Moses and Aaron, listen up,' 2. Yo, all the dudes from the children of Israel gonna set up their own standard, repping their dad's house. They gonna chill way off near the tabernacle of the congregation, you know, like right across from it. 3. And on the east side where the sun comes up, the crew representing the camp of Judah will set up camp with all their squads. Nahshon, Amminadab's son, will lead the way for the people of Judah. 4. And the crew, along with the ones who were counted, were like, sixty-four thousand and six hundred strong. 5. And the ones camping next to him will be the tribe of Issachar. Nethaneel, Zuar's son, will be the leader of the Issacharites. 6. And the gang, and the squad that was repping, consisted of a solid 54.4k. 7. And representing the Zebulun squad is Eliab, Helon's offspring, who's about to take charge of the Zebulun crew. 8. And his squad, and the total count, were like 57k4h (57,400). 9. In the Judah squad, there were like a hundred thousand, eighty thousand, six thousand, and four hundred people. They're the ones leading the pack, yo. 10. On the south side, the camp of Reuben will have their flag, with Elizur, son of Shedeur, leading their troops. 11. So, his crew and all the people in it, there were a total of 46,500. 12. And the ones who camp next to him will be from the tribe of Simeon, and the leader of the Simeonites will be Shelumiel, son of Zurishaddai. 13. And the squad, and all the peeps in it, were like fifty-nine thousand and three hundred in total. 14. Next up, the squad of Gad: Eliasaph, Reuel's son, will be leading the way for the sons of Gad. (By the way, Reuel is also known as Deuel.) 15. And the squad he had, those counted among them, were 45,650 strong. 16. The total number of peeps in Reuben's crew was 150,450, spread out across their squads. And they're gonna roll out in the second wave, ya know? 17. Then the meeting spot will move along with the Levites in the middle of the crew. They'll camp and move forward according to their assigned spots, each person following their own team. 18. The squad of Ephraim will rock it on the west side, with their leader Elishama, Ammihud's offspring, leading their crew like a boss. 19. And his squad, and the ones that got counted, they were, like, 40k and 500. 20. And Manasseh's crew will be led by Gamaliel, Pedahzur's offspring. 21. And his crew, and the total number of them, were 32.2K. 22. Next up is the crew from Benjamin, led by Abidan, son of Gideoni. He's got it on lock for his tribe, no doubt. 23. And his squad, and the total number of them, were like, 35.4k. 24. There were like, a whopping 108.1K soldiers in the Ephraim squad, ready to rumble. And they were gonna bring it, stepping up strong in the third position. 25. Yo, the camp of Dan gonna be on the north, surrounded by their armies, and leading the children of Dan is gonna be Ahiezer, Ammishaddai's son, as their captain. 26. And his crew, and the total number of them, were sixty-two thousand and seven hundred. 27. And the squad chilling with him will be the crew of Asher: and the leader of the Asher squad will be Pagiel, Ocran's son. 28. And the squad, along with all the cool peeps in it, totaled up to a whopping forty-one thousand five hundred! 29. And now, peep this squad from Naphtali: leading the pack of Naphtali crew will be Ahira, the offspring of Enan. 30. And the squad, along with all those who got counted, totaled up to fifty-three thousand and four hundred. 31. So, like, there were, like, a hundred thousand and fifty-seven thousand and six hundred peeps in the camp of Dan. And they gotta, like, chill in the back with their flags or whatever. 32. So here's the deal: we got a headcount of all the Israelite peeps, organized by their family clans. The total number of folks included in this count, spread across all the different squads, was a whopping six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 33. But, like, the Levites weren't part of the headcount with the other Israelites, cuz that's what the LORD told Moses to do. 34. So, like, the Israelites totally followed all the instructions that the LORD gave to Moses. They set up camp in their designated spots and went on their way, like, moving forward and all. Each fam had their own assigned spot, you know, based on their dad's lineage. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 21. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 2. Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch. {far...: Heb. over against} 3. And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their armies: and Nahshon the son of Amminadab {shall be} captain of the children of Judah. 4. And his host, and those that were numbered of them, {were} threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred. 5. And those that do pitch next unto him {shall be} the tribe of Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar {shall be} captain of the children of Issachar. 6.

All that were numbered in the camp of Reuben {were} an hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, throughout their armies. And they shall set forth in the second rank. 17. Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp: as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by their standards. 18. On the west side {shall be} the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of Ephraim {shall be} Elishama the son of Ammihud. 19.

And his host, and those that were numbered of them, {were} fifty and three thousand and four hundred. 31. All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan {were} an hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They shall go hindmost with their standards. 32. These {are} those which were numbered of the children of Israel by the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of the camps throughout their hosts {were} six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty. 33. But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses. 34. And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, every one after their families, according to the house of their fathers. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 31. Here's the fam history of Aaron and Moses when the LORD was chatting with Moses up on Mount Sinai. 2. So like, Aaron had these four sons and their names were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 3. So, these are the names of Aaron's boys, the cool priests who were chosen and set apart to do their priestly duties. It's like they got totally blessed by being anointed. And just to be clear, they were chosen and filled with the power to do their priestly thing by Aaron himself. 4. So, Nadab and Abihu straight up got smited by the LORD because they pulled a major goof and offered some sketchy fire in the presence of the LORD. This happened in the wild 'n' free Sinai land, and to top it off, they didn't even have any kids. To fill their vacancy, Eleazar and Ithamar stepped up and did the priestly tasks while Aaron, their dad, looked on. 5. So God talked to Moses like, 6. Gather the Levi squad and bring them to Aaron the head honcho priest, so they can be his trusted crew for all things ministry. 7. And they gotta make sure they stay on top of their duties, looking after the whole crew and keeping everything in check by the hangout spot, making sure everything runs smoothly in the hangout. 8. And they gotta be responsible for all the stuff in the gathering place, like the instruments and everything, and make sure the Israelite peeps take care of business and do all the tasks needed for the gathering place. 9. And you gotta hook up Aaron and his fam with the Levites. They totally belong to them from the Israelite crew. 10. Yo, choose Aaron and his homies to do their priest duties and protect their priest's office. And anyone who ain't part of the crew better watch out 'cause they'll be straight up terminated. 11. yo, God came at Moses like, 12. Yo, listen up! Check it, I've chosen the Levites from the fam of Israel to take the place of all the firstborn who come out of the womb. So basically, the Levites are gonna be all mine, ya dig? 13. Yo, all the firstborn, they belong to me, you know what I'm saying? When I unleashed my power and messed up Egypt, that's when I specially claimed all the firstborn in Israel, humans and animals alike. They're mine, fam. I'm the almighty, no doubt. 14. So, God was like talking to Moses out in the middle of nowhere, in Sinai, and this is what He said, 15. Count all the Levi kids according to their dads' houses, by their fams. You gotta count all the dudes who are one month old or older. 16. So Moses counted them just as the LORD told him to. {translation: in other words, exactly as God said} 17. So, like, these were the dudes from the Levi squad, you know? They had some pretty cool names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 18. So here's the deal, these are the names of Gershon's sons and their fams: Libni and Shimei, ya feel me? 19. And Kohath had some sons: Amram, Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel, each belonging to their own family. 20. And Merari had these cool families: Mahli and Mushi. So, these are the families of the Levites based on their dad's houses. 21. The Libnites and the Shimites were part of Gershon's crew. Ya heard? These dudes were reppin' the Gershonites, straight up. 22. So, like, there were seven thousand, five hundred dudes, you know, all aged one month and older, all, like, counted up and stuff. 23. The Gershonite fams gonna set up shop behind the tabernacle, towards the west side. 24. And the head of the fam of the Gershonites gotta be Eliasaph, Lael's kid. 25. The job of the Gershon dudes in the gathering spot party crib is to take care of the party crib itself, the chill camping pad, the dope roof, and the swaggy entrance curtain. 26. And the sick curtains all around the chill hangout spot, and the epic door curtain for the chill hangout spot, which is right by the chill tabernacle and the lit altar, and the sick cords for all the chill services there. 27. The Kohath fam got the Amram squad, the Izehar clique, the Hebron crew, and the Uzziel squad. Those peeps are the fams of the Kohath squad. 28. There were a total of 8.6K dudes, aged one month and up, holding it down and taking care of the holy place. 29. The Kohath fams gonna set up their tents on the south side of the tabernacle, fam. 30. And the main guy in charge of the family clans of the Kohathites will be Elizaphan, Uzziel's son, just so you know. 31. Their job is to take care of the ark, the table, the candlestick, the altars, the vessels used in the sanctuary, the hanging, and all the other tasks that need to be done. 32. And Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, shall be the ultimate leader among the top-notch Levites, and he will be in charge of supervising those who ensure the utmost care for the sacred sanctuary. 33. Merari's crew was made up of the Mahlites and the Mushites. That's the fam of Merari, y'all. 34. And, like, the total number of dudes that were counted, you know, were like six thousand two hundred, like from just a month old and older. 35. The top dude from the fam of Merari was Zuriel, Abihail's son. They gonna set up camp on the north side of the tabernacle. 36. The sons of Merari are in charge of taking care of the boards, bars, pillars, sockets, and all the stuff in the tabernacle. They've got the whole setup under their watch, and it's their responsibility to make sure everything's in order. 37. And the lit AF pillars of the court all around, with their dope sockets, lit pins, and sick cords. 38. But the ones that chill near the tabernacle on the east side, yeah, the ones right by the gathering spot, gotta be Moses, Aaron, and his sons. They're responsible for taking care of the holy place and making sure the Israelites behave. Oh, and if anyone else gets too close, they're getting cancelled... like, literally, they'll be put to death. 39. So, like, Moses and Aaron counted all the Levites, you know, as instructed by the LORD. They counted all the guys, from one month old and up, in each family, and the total was, like, twenty-two thousand. Pretty impressive, right? 40. Yo, Moses, listen up. God wants you to count all the baby dudes of Israel, who are one month old and older. Get their names and keep track of 'em. 41. And you gotta choose the Levites for me (I'm the LORD) instead of all the firstborns of the Israelites; and the Levites' animals instead of all the firstborns of the Israelites' animals. 42. So Moses did what God told him to do and counted all the firstborn kids in Israel. 43. So, like, there were, uh, 22,213 firstborn dude babies who were one month old or older when they were counted. 44. So God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up!' 45. Yo, I got a quick request for y'all. Instead of the firstborn kids of Israel and their animals, I want the Levites and their cattle. They're gonna be on my squad, 'cause I'm the LORD. 46. And for those who are gonna be redeemed, there's a total of 213 firstborn children of Israel, which is more than the Levites. 47. You gotta collect five shekels from each person, according to the sanctuary shekel (which is twenty gerahs): 48. And you gotta send the cash to Aaron and his squad for the redemption of the odd ones. 49. So Moses collected extra money from those who were redeemed by the Levites: 50. He collected money from the firstborn of the Israelites, totaling 1,365 shekels, according to the standard shekel used in the sanctuary: 51. So Moses handed over the cash from those who were saved to Aaron and his crew, just like the LORD said. Moses was just following orders, man. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 31. These also {are} the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day {that} the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai. 2. And these {are} the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 3. These {are} the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office. {whom...: Heb. whose hand he filled} 4. And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father. 5. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6. Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him. 7. And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle. 8. And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle. 9. And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they {are} wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel. 10. And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 11. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12. And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine; 13. Because all the firstborn {are} mine; {for} on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I {am} the LORD. 14. And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, 15. Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. 16. And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded. {word: Heb. mouth} 17. And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. 18. And these {are} the names of the sons of Gershon by their families; Libni, and Shimei. 19. And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 20. And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi. These {are} the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers. 21. Of Gershon {was} the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites: these {are} the families of the Gershonites. 22. Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, {even} those that were numbered of them {were} seven thousand and five hundred. 23. The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward. 24. And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites {shall be} Eliasaph the son of Lael. 25. And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation {shall be} the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 26. And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court, which {is} by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof. 27. And of Kohath {was} the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these {are} the families of the Kohathites. 28. In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, {were} eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary. 29. The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward. 30. And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites {shall be} Elizaphan the son of Uzziel. 31. And their charge {shall be} the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof. 32. And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest {shall be} chief over the chief of the Levites, {and have} the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary. 33. Of Merari {was} the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these {are} the families of Merari. 34. And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, {were} six thousand and two hundred. 35. And the chief of the house of the father of the families of Merari {was} Zuriel the son of Abihail: {these} shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward. 36. And {under} the custody and charge of the sons of Merari {shall be} the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto, {under...: Heb. the office of the charge} 37. And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords. 38. But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, {even} before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, {shall be} Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 39. All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, {were} twenty and two thousand. 40. And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. 41. And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I {am} the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel. 42. And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of Israel. 43. And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. 44. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 45. Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I {am} the LORD. 46. And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites; 47. Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take {them}: (the shekel {is} twenty gerahs:) 48. And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons. 49. And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites: 50. Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five {shekels}, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 51. And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 41. So, like, God starts talking to Moses and Aaron, right? And this is what He says, 2. Count all the dudes from the Kohath squad, who are part of the Levi crew, based on their chill families and their dads' cribs. 3. Anyone between the ages of thirty and fifty who joins the crew and helps out at the gathering spot needs to step up and do their duties at the sacred tent. 4. So, this is the gig for the Kohath crew in the tent where everyone gathers - they handle the super sacred stuff, no joke: 5. And when the crew moves on, Aaron and his fam will come through and they'll take down the cool curtain thingy, and use it to cover up the important ark of testimony:  6. Then they'll cover it with badger skin, and put a blue cloth over it completely, and attach the poles to it. 7. And they should put a blue cloth on the table, along with the dishes, spoons, and bowls, all covered. The everlasting bread will be placed on it. 8. So, they gotta wrap them up in this sick scarlet cloth, and then cover it all with some dope badgers' skins and fix it up with cool staves, ya know. 9. And they gotta grab a blue cloth and cover that lit candlestick and all its lamps, tongs, snuff dishes, and oil vessels that are used to take care of it, ya know? 10. And they gotta wrap it up and all the cool stuff inside with some sick badgers' skins. Then they'll slide that bad boy onto a bar, like, totally sleek style. 11. And on the sick altar, they gotta lay down a dope blue cloth, and cover it up with some sick badgers' skins, and attach the handles to it: 12. And they gotta grab all the stuff they use for their holy duties in the sacred place, wrap it up in a cool blue cloth, and then cover it with some sweet badgers' skins. Then they gotta put it on a bar. 13. And they gotta clean up the ashes from the altar, then put a super stylish purple cloth on it like, WOW! 14. And they gotta place on it all the stuff they use for serving, like the incense burners, the meat hooks, the shovels, and the bowls - basically everything used at the altar. Oh, and don't forget to cover it up with some badger skins and attach the carrying poles to it. 15. And once Aaron and his homies finish covering up the sacred space and all the cool stuff in it, and the squad is ready to move out, then it's the Kohath siblings' turn to carry the important stuff, but they better not lay a finger on anything holy, or they'll be straight up dead. These are the major responsibilities of the Kohath siblings in the hangout spot of worship. 16. And Eleazar, Aaron's son who rocks the priest game, is in charge of the oil for lighting, the dope incense, the daily food offering, the anointing oil, keeping an eye on the whole tabernacle, and all the cool stuff inside it, like the sanctuary and its lit vessels. 17. Yo, God talked to Moses and Aaron, like, 18. Don't ditch the Kohathites from the Levites fam squad: 19. So here's what you gotta do, fam: make sure you treat them right, so they stay alive and don't get wiped out, when they come near the super sacred stuff. Aaron and his crew will step in and assign each person their specific tasks and responsibilities. 20. But, like, they can't go and peek at the holy things all covered up, otherwise they'll, like, die or something. 21. And God like totally slid into Moses' DMs, saying, 22. Yo, count up the Gershon homies from each of their fam's houses, man. 23. You gotta count all the peeps, aged 30 to 50, who are ready to serve and do work in the spot where everyone comes together. It's like they're getting prepped for battle, ya know? 24. This is what the Gershonites are responsible for: serving and carrying burdens. 25. And they gotta carry the cool curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle for everyone to hang out, the stuff that goes on top, and like the super chill covering made from badgers' skins that's put over it. Oh, and they also need to hang up the door cover for the tabernacle. Pretty lit, right? 26. And the cool curtains surrounding the court, and the dope curtain for the entrance to the gate of the court, yo, right by the tabernacle and the altar and all that, and their cords, and all the lit equipment they use, and everything specifically made for them, that's how they gonna serve. 27. Aaron and his crew are in charge of all the stuff the Gershonites have to do, including all their hard work and tasks. Make sure to give them clear instructions on what they need to be responsible for. 28. So, here's what the fam of Gershon's sons gotta do in the tabernacle: they're under the authority of Ithamar, Aaron the priest's son. No joke, that's their gig. 29. When it comes to the Merari fam, you gotta count 'em up based on their family and their dad's crib. 30. You gotta count all the peeps that are between thirty and fifty years old, cause they're the ones gonna do the work for the tabernacle. It's like a service, but more like a battle, ya know? {service: btw, it's Hebrew for warfare} 31. And this is what they had to do, all of their tasks in the sacred meeting place: setting up the wooden walls, attaching the bars, erecting the sturdy pillars, and securing the foundations. 32. So like, there were these dope pillars all around the court, and not gonna lie, they had these cool sockets and pins with cords and all that jazz. And oh yeah, they had all these sick instruments and stuff for their service. And yo, make sure you know the names of all the instruments they used in their tasks, it's important! 33. This is how the fams of the Merari boys do their thing, you know. They handle all the tasks at the meeting place, taking directions from Ithamar, Aaron's son, who's the priest. 34. So, Moses, Aaron, and the head honchos of the crew counted the Kohathite dudes, organizing them based on their fams and ancestral homes. 35. Anyone between thirty and fifty years old who wants to join the team and help out in the gathering place tent, can totally do it: 36. So, like, the total number of peeps from each fam was, like, 2,750. 37. These were the people from the families of the Kohathites who were counted, all those who could help out at the gathering place. Moses and Aaron counted them just as the LORD commanded, through Moses. 38. So, like, they like counted the sons of Gershon, you know, like did a head count of their fams and which fathers' houses they belonged to. 39. Anyone between the ages of thirty and fifty, who enters into service for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation, 40. So, like, the total count of them, like, within their clans, based on their family lineage, was like, two thousand six hundred and thirty peeps. 41. These are the peeps who were counted from the families of the squad of Gershon, all those who could do work in the hangout spot of the crew, who Moses and Aaron counted as per the command of the Big Man Upstairs. 42. And the squad of Merari's sons was counted, with each family repping their OG dads' crib, 43. Anyone who's aged thirty or above, all the way up to fifty, and wants to serve in the tabernacle, can do so! 44. So, like, when they counted all the peeps in their fam, there were, like, 3,200 of them. 45. So here's the scoop: these are the peeps who got counted out from the Merari fam, you know, Moses and Aaron did the counting, following the word of the big man upstairs, delivered by Moses himself. 46. So, Moses, Aaron, and the OG leaders of Israel, counted all them Levites, you know, from each fam and their ancestral house. 47. Anyone who volunteered for ministry work or helped with the heavy lifting at the meeting place had to be between the ages of thirty and fifty. 48. There were like, a total of 8,580 peeps in their crew, no cap. 49. As the LORD ordered, Moses counted each person according to their role and responsibility. They were all counted as the LORD commanded Moses. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 41. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 2. Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers, 3. From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation. 4. This {shall be} the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation, {about} the most holy things: 5. And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it: 6. And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and shall spread over {it} a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof. 7. And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon: {cover...: or, pour out withal} 8. And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in the staves thereof. 9. And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it: 10. And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put {it} upon a bar. 11. And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put to the staves thereof: 12. And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put {them} in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put {them} on a bar: 13. And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon: 14. And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, {even} the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it. {basons: or, bowls} 15. And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear {it}: but they shall not touch {any} holy thing, lest they die. These {things are} the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation. 16. And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest {pertaineth} the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, {and} the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein {is}, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof. 17. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 18. Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites: 19. But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden: 20. But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die. 21. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 22. Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families; 23. From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation. {to perform...: Heb. to war the warfare} 24. This {is} the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and for burdens: {burdens: or, carriage} 25. And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that {is} above upon it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 26. And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which {is} by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they serve. 27. At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens. {appointment: Heb. mouth} 28. This {is} the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge {shall be} under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 29. As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their families, by the house of their fathers; 30. From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation. {service: Heb. warfare} 31. And this {is} the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets thereof, 32. And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden. 33. This {is} the service of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 34. And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house of their fathers, 35. From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation: 36. And those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty. 37. These {were} they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 38. And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers, 39. From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation, 40. Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and six hundred and thirty. 41. These {are} they that were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD. 42. And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, 43. From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation, 44. Even those that were numbered of them after their families, were three thousand and two hundred. 45. These {be} those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 46. All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and after the house of their fathers, 47. From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation, 48. Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and five hundred and fourscore. 49. According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the LORD commanded Moses. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 51. Then God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,' 2. Tell the kids of Israel to kick out all the people with leprosy, anyone dealing with bodily issues, and anyone who's been around dead bodies. 3. You gotta remove both dudes and chicks from the camp and keep 'em outside so they don't mess up the camp where I'm chilling. 4. So the Israelite squad followed through and kicked them out of the camp, just like the LORD told Moses. They were totally on point, no doubt. 5. God hit up Moses and was like, 6. Yo, listen up Israelites! If any dude or chick out here starts doing some shady stuff, like sinning and straight up disrespecting the Lord, they gonna be in trouble, fam. 7. So, like, they gotta totally admit their mistake, right? And, um, they gotta make it right by paying back the full amount they owe, plus an extra 20%, and give it to the person they wronged, you know? 8. But if the dude doesn't have any fam to pay back the wrong, then the wrong should be paid to the LORD, like to the priest and stuff. Plus, there's this ram for making up for it, like to make things right and stuff. 9. And whatever the kids of Israel give to the priest as their holy stuff, it becomes his. {offering: or, heave offering} 10. And everyone can keep their own sacred things: whatever anyone gives to the priest, it will belong to them. 11. So like, God, totally talked to Moses and was like, 12. Yo, kids of Israel, listen up! So, if a dude's wife goes astray and does him dirty, 13. And if a guy hooks up with her without her husband knowing, and they keep it a secret, and she cheats on her husband, and there's no one who saw them, and she doesn't get caught... 14. And if he starts feeling all jealous and suspicious about his wife, thinking she's unfaithful, whether she actually did anything wrong or not, 15. So, the guy needs to take his wife to the priest and give her offering, which is like one-tenth of a basket of barley meal. Don't forget, no oil or fancy stuff like frankincense on it. This offering is to deal with jealousy and remember any wrongdoings, like a reminder. 16. Then the priest will bring her up and put her in front of the LORD: 17. The priest gotta grab some holy water in, like, a clay pot and mix it with a lil' bit of the dust from the floor of the tabernacle. They gotta put that dust right into the water, you know? 18. So, the priest brings the woman before the Lord, removes her head covering, and gives her the jealousy offering to hold. The priest also holds the bitter water that will cause the curse. 19. The priest will make her swear and tell her, if no dude has slept with you, and if you haven't cheated on your husband, then you're in the clear from this crazy water that brings a curse. 20. But if you've like, cheated on your husband and like, defiled yourself by sleeping with someone else besides your husband: 21. So the priest is gonna call out the woman and make her swear, and he's gonna say to her, 'God's gonna make you a total curse and swear word among your peeps. He's gonna make your leg go gross and your stomach blow up.' 22. And this water that brings the curse will go into your stomach and make your belly swell, and your thigh rot: And the woman will say, Amen, amen. 23. The priest gotta jot down all these bad vibes in a book, and then erase 'em with some super salty water: 24. Then he make the woman drink the nasty water that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse will make her feel bitter. 25. Next, the priest takes the jealousy offering from the woman and does this cool wave thing with it in front of the LORD before putting it on the altar: 26. Then the priest grabs a handful of the offering, like a memorial, and burns it on the altar. After that, they make the woman drink the water. 27. And once she drinks the water, if she did something wrong and betrayed her husband, then the cursed water will get inside her and make her feel bitter. Her belly will swell up and her thigh will rot. She will be seen as a curse among her people. 28. And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean, then she'll be free to conceive. 29. Here's the deal when it comes to jealousy: if a wife disses her man and gets with another guy, breaking the trust, and yeah, things get pretty messed up. 30. Or when he starts feeling all jealous and possessive about his wife, and decides to bring her before the LORD, and the priest has to follow through with all the rules and punishments. 31. So, like, the dude won't be responsible for any wrongdoing, and the girl will have to take the blame for her own wrongdoing. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 51. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the dead: 3. Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell. 4. And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel. 5. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6. Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be guilty; 7. Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth {part} thereof, and give {it} unto {him} against whom he hath trespassed. 8. But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, {even} to the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him. 9. And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his. {offering: or, heave offering} 10. And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth the priest, it shall be his. 11. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 12. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him, 13. And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and {there be} no witness against her, neither she be taken {with the manner}; 14. And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled: 15. Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth {part} of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it {is} an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance. 16. And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD: 17. And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put {it} into the water: 18. And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which {is} the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse: 19. And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness {with another} instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse: {with another...: or, being in the power of thy husband: Heb. under thy husband} 20. But if thou hast gone aside {to another} instead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband: 21. Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell; {rot: Heb. fall} 22. And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make {thy} belly to swell, and {thy} thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen. 23. And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot {them} out with the bitter water: 24. And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, {and become} bitter. 25. Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar: 26. And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, {even} the memorial thereof, and burn {it} upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water. 27. And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, {that}, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, {and become} bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. 28. And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed. 29. This {is} the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside {to another} instead of her husband, and is defiled; 30. Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law. 31. Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 61. So God was like, talking to Moses, and He said, 2. Yo, listen up, Israelites! God's got a message for y'all. If a dude or a chick wants to take a vow as a Nazarite and dedicate themselves to the Lord, they gotta do it right. It's all about that separation, you feel me? 3. He's gotta ditch the booze, no more wine, beer, or any boozy vinegar. Not even grape juice or juicy grapes, fresh or dried. Strictly dry lifestyle. 4. During the entire time of their commitment, they must avoid anything made from grapes, from the juicy fruit to the outer shells. 🍇 5. During the entire time of their commitment, they can't shave their head. They have to let their hair grow long as a way of showing they're dedicated to the LORD. It's a symbol of their holiness. 6. Whenever he dedicates himself to the LORD, he can't be around any dead peeps. 7. He shouldn't do anything that would dishonor his family when they pass away, because he has dedicated himself to God's guidance. 8. During his whole separation period, he's completely devoted to the LORD. 9. If someone suddenly dies near you and you accidentally mess up your holy head thingy, then you gotta shave your head to get clean, and you gotta do it on the seventh day. 10. And like, on the eighth day he's gotta bring, like, two cool turtles or two rad young pigeons to the priest, right at the door of the super chill tabernacle of the crew: 11. The priest will offer one as a sin offering, and the other as a burnt offering, to make things right for them because they messed up with the dead. Then, their head will be consecrated on that very same day. 12. So like, he's gotta dedicate himself to God during his time of being set apart, you know? And he's gotta bring a young lamb as an offering to make up for any wrongdoings. But here's the deal, any days that happened before he messed up and defiled his separation, they won't count anymore. They'll just kinda fade away, ya know? 13. Yo, here's the deal for the Nazarite: Once the time of their separation is up, they gotta be taken to the entrance of the tabernacle, where the congregation gathers. It's the law, fam. 14. And he's gonna bring his offering to the LORD, like a good vibes only young lamb for a sick burnt offering, and a fly ewe lamb for a lit sin offering, and a rad ram for peace offerings, all of them flawless and looking fresh. 15. And a basket of flatbread, delicious cakes made with fancy flour mixed with oil, and crispy unleavened bread soaked in oil, along with their food offering and drink offerings. 16. Then the priest gotta bring those offerings right in front of the LORD, and do his thing with the sin offering and burnt offering: 17. And like, he's gonna bring that ram as, you know, a sick offering to the LORD, along with this basket full of like non-leavened bread. The priest will also offer his own cool meat offering and drink offering. 18. The Nazarite gotta buzz his hair at the entrance of the meeting spot, then grab those locks and toss 'em in the fire under the peace offerings. 19. The priest gonna grab the cooked ram's shoulder, plus one unleavened cake from the basket, and one unleavened wafer. He'll then put 'em on the hands of the Nazarite after their hair has been shaved off as part of their consecration. 20. And the priest shall flex them like a wave offering before the LORD: this is lit for the priest, along with the wavy chest and lifted shoulder: and then the Nazarite can turn up with some wine. 21. Yo, here's the deal for those Nazarites who made a vow and brought their offering to the LORD as a sign of their dedication, apart from whatever they earn with their own hands. They gotta keep their word and follow all the rules that come with their commitment. 22. So, like, God came up to Moses and was like, 23. Yo, Aaron and his squad, listen up. When you talkin' to the kids of Israel, this is how you bless 'em: 24. May God bless you and watch over you:  25. May the LORD light up your life and show you love and kindness: 26. May God bless you with good vibes and grant you inner peace. 27. And they gonna flex my name on the squad of Israel; and I'll bless them. \n",

      "Gen Z: Numbers 81. And God was like, 'Yo, Moses, listen up,' 2. Yo, Aaron! When you light up those lamps, make sure all seven lamps shine bright right across from the candlestick, alright? 3. And Aaron did it; he lit the lamps just like the LORD told Moses. 4. The candlestick was made of pure gold and had intricate details, like flowers, that were also beaten into shape. It was created exactly as the LORD showed Moses, following the divine blueprint. 5. Yo, the LORD totally spoke to Moses, like, straight up said, 6. Yo, pick some Levites from the crew of Israel, and make sure they're clean AF. 7. So this is what you gotta do to make things right: Splash them with some cleansing water, totally shave off every hair, give their clothes a good scrub, and they'll be squeaky clean. Yeah, that's how it's done. 8. Alright, grab a fresh young bullock and pair it up with a cool meat offering, like some fine flour mixed with oil. Oh, and don't forget to grab another young bullock for a sin offering. 9. Yo, bring all the Levites to the tabernacle and gather the entire crew of Israelite homies: 10. And, like, you gotta gather the Levites and bring them before the LORD, ya know? And then, the children of Israel gotta lay their hands on the Levites, for real. 11. And Aaron is gonna flex the Levites in front of the LORD, like an offering from the squad of Israel, so they can do their thing for the LORD. Ya know, wave 'em and all that. They gotta execute the service, you know how it is. 12. The Levites gonna put their hands on the bullocks' heads: you gonna offer one of 'em as a sin offering, and the other one as a burnt offering, to the LORD, to make things right for the Levites. 13. And you'll put the Levites in front of Aaron and his sons, and present them as an offering to the LORD. 14. So basically, you gotta pull the Levites aside from all the Israelite kids. Like, they're gonna be exclusively mine, you know? 15. Then the Levites will start doing their thing at the tabernacle, and you gotta make sure they're all clean and offer them as an offering. 16. Yo, the children of Israel are like, fully dedicated to me. I've chosen them to be mine, in place of the firstborn of every Israelite. They're all mine, my peeps. 17. All the firstborns of the Israelites belong to me, including humans and animals. On the day when I punished the firstborns in Egypt, I set them apart as sacred for myself. 18. So like, I chose the Levites to take care of all the firstborn peeps of Israel. 19. So, like, I've chosen the Levites to be a special present for Aaron and his sons. They'll be the ones doing all the important work in the tabernacle and making things right for the people of Israel. This way, no bad stuff will happen to the people when they get close to the sanctuary. 20. So, like, Moses, Aaron, and all the crew of Israelite peeps, they did exactly what the LORD told Moses to do for the Levites. The whole gang of Israelites followed through on that for them. 21. The Levites were like, super clean after they washed their clothes and stuff. Then, Aaron offered them up as an offering to the LORD, and he made sure they were all purified and cleansed. It was like a fresh start for them and all, ya know? 22. And then the Levites went in to do their job in the tabernacle in front of Aaron and his sons, just as the LORD had told Moses to command the Levites. So, the Levites did as they were told. 23. God hit up Moses and was like, 24. Here's what the Levites gotta do: once they hit 25, they start serving at the tabernacle. It's like their duty, you know? Can't wait until they're old enough, then they can do all the important stuff there. It's like waging a war, but inside the tabernacle, y'know? 25. Once they hit fifty, they're off duty and don't have to serve anymore. No more going into battle! 26. But they gotta work together with their squad in the tabernacle, doin' their duties, but ain't gotta hustle. That's how you gotta treat the Levites when it comes to their responsibilities. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 81. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick. 3. And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses. 4. And this work of the candlestick {was of} beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, {was} beaten work: according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick. 5. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 6. Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. 7. And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and {so} make themselves clean. {let them shave...: Heb. let them cause a razor to pass over, etc} 8. Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, {even} fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering. 9. And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together: 10. And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites: 11. And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD {for} an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD. {offer: Heb. wave} {offering: Heb. wave offering} {they...: Heb. they may be to execute, etc} 12. And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one {for} a sin offering, and the other {for} a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites. 13. And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them {for} an offering unto the LORD. 14. Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine. 15. And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them {for} an offering. 16. For they {are} wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, {even instead of} the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me. 17. For all the firstborn of the children of Israel {are} mine, {both} man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself. 18. And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel. 19. And I have given the Levites {as} a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary. {a gift: Heb. given} 20. And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. 21. And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them {as} an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them. 22. And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them. 23. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24. This {is it} that {belongeth} unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: {to...: Heb. to war the warfare of, etc} 25. And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service {thereof}, and shall serve no more: {cease...: Heb. return from the warfare of the service} 26. But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 91. So like, God totally talked to Moses while they were chillin' in the middle of nowhere Sinai, about a year after they escaped from Egypt, and this is what He said, 2. Make sure the children of Israel don't forget to celebrate the passover when the time comes, alright? 3. On the fourteenth day of this month, when it gets dark, you gotta celebrate it on time, following all the rituals and ceremonies. {at even: Hebrew for between the two evenings} 4. So Moses talked to the Israelites, telling them to totally celebrate the passover. 5. And they totally celebrated the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, like, in the wilderness of Sinai. They did everything exactly how the LORD told Moses to do it, and the children of Israel were totally on point with that. 6. So, there were these guys who, like, touched a dead dude and got all, like, contaminated and stuff. They couldn't celebrate the passover that day. So, they went and talked to Moses and Aaron about it, you know, like asking for help and guidance on what to do. It was a big deal, man. 7. And those guys were like, dude, we're totally contaminated by touching a dead body. So, why are we being held back from bringing our offering to the Lord at the right time, with all the other kids in Israel? 8. Moses was like, 'Hold up, fam. Imma wait here and see what the LORD's got to say about y'all.' 9. So like, God was talking to Moses, and He was all like, 10. Yo, listen up! So, God's saying to the peeps of Israel, if any of y'all or your descendants happen to be unclean 'cause of, like, dead bodies or if you're out on a super long trip, don't sweat it. You can still celebrate Passover and show love to the big man upstairs, the LORD. 11. On the fourteenth day of the second month, when night falls, it's time to get ready for the feast. Gather around and dig into some tasty unleavened bread and tangy herbs. 12. They gotta finish eating it all before the next day, and definitely not mess up any of the bones. Gotta follow all the rules of the passover feast, no exception. 13. But if the dude is clean and chillin' at home, and he decides not to celebrate the passover, he's gonna be kicked out of his squad. It's 'cause he didn't bring the offering to the LORD when he was supposed to, so he's gotta own up to his mistake. 14. And if someone who's not from around here comes to hang with y'all, and they wanna join in on the passover celebrations to honor the LORD, they gotta follow all the rules and traditions, just like everybody else. We're all in this together, no matter where we're from. 15. So, like, when they finished setting up the tabernacle, this totally cool cloud just completely covered it, specifically the tent where they stored the testimony. And when evening came, it looked like there was this rad fire on top of the tabernacle, all the way until morning. 16. And it was always like this: the cloud covered it during the day, and there was a lit fire at night. 17. So like, once the cloud was all gone from the tabernacle, the Israelites were like, 'Let's go!'. They would set out and camp wherever the cloud stopped and stayed for a bit. 18. When the LORD told them to, the peeps of Israel started moving, and when the LORD told them to stop, they set up camp. They chilled in their tents as long as that cloud stayed put on the tabernacle. 19. And like, when the cloud hung out over the tabernacle for, like, a super long time, the children of Israel were, like, totally on point and didn't go anywhere, because that's what the LORD wanted. #nohurry 20. So, like, the cloud hung around the tabernacle for a little while, and as the LORD said, they stayed in their tents, and then they moved when the LORD said so. 21. So, like, when the cloud hung around from evening until morning, and when the cloud lifted in the morning, they started moving. Whether it was during the day or at night when the cloud lifted, they kept on moving. 22. Whether it was chillin' for two days, a whole month, or even a whole year, whenever that cloud hung out on the tabernacle, the squad of Israelites would stay kickin' it in their tents, not goin' anywhere. But as soon as that cloud was lifted, it was time to hit the road, no time to waste. 23. The squad listened up when the LORD gave the word to chill in their tents, and when the LORD said it's time to roll, they moved out. They stayed loyal to the LORD, following Moses as their guide, just as the LORD commanded. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 91. And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 2. Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed season. 3. In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it. {at even: Heb. between the two evenings} 4. And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover. 5. And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel. 6. And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 7. And those men said unto him, We {are} defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel? 8. And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you. 9. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 10. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or {be} in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD. 11. The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, {and} eat it with unleavened bread and bitter {herbs}. 12. They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. 13. But the man that {is} clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. 14. And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land. 15. And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, {namely}, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning. 16. So it was alway: the cloud covered it {by day}, and the appearance of fire by night. 17. And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. 18. At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. 19. And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. {tarried...: Heb. prolonged} 20. And {so} it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed. 21. And {so} it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and {that} the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether {it was} by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. {abode: Heb. was} 22. Or {whether it were} two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed. 23. At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 101. And God was like, yo Moses, listen up, 2. Yo, make two lit silver trumpets, all in one piece. It's for calling the squad together and letting 'em know it's time to move camps. 3. And when they sound the alarm, everyone should gather at the entrance of the meeting spot. 4. And if they sound with just one trumpet, then the leaders, who are in charge of the thousands of Israel, will come together with you. 5. When you sound an alarm, the camps on the east side shall move ahead. 6. When you sound the horn again, the camps on the south side will start moving. They will sound the horn to signal their journey. 7. But when the squad's all chillin' and it's time to meet up, you can bring the vibes with a little blow, just don't go all extra and sound the alarm, ya feel me? 8. So like, Aaron's sons, the priests, gotta blast those trumpets, okay? It's gonna be a forever thing, like for all y'all in the fam, ya dig? 9. If you find yourself in a battle on your own turf against your oppressors, make some noise with those trumpets! God will take notice, and He'll help you kick some enemy butt. 10. And when you're having a lit day, or on those special occasions, or at the start of each month, make sure to blast those trumpets to show your appreciation for the sacrifices you've made. It's like a reminder to God that you're grateful. And just so you know, I'm the LORD your God. 11. So, like, on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, the cloud was, like, totally gone from the tabernacle of the testimony. 12. So the Israelites started moving from the desert of Sinai, and the cool cloud settled in the desert of Paran. 13. So they set off, totally following what the LORD told them through Moses. 14. First up, the camp of the kids from Judah was led by Nahshon, Amminadab's offspring. They had their own cool flag and everything. 15. And leading the crew from the tribe of Issachar was Nethaneel, who happened to be Zuar's son. 16. And in charge of the crew from the Zebulun squad was Eliab, Helon's son. 17. So the tent was packed up, and the Gershon and Merari fams rolled out, carrying the tent with them. 18. Then Reuben's squad started moving, organized according to their groups, with Elizur, Shedeur's son, leading over them. 19. And in charge of the tribe of the Simeon gang was Shelumiel, son of Zurishaddai. 20. And in charge of the squad from the tribe of Gad was Eliasaph, son of Deuel. 21. So the Kohathites moved ahead, carrying the holy stuff, while the others set up the tabernacle before they arrived. (Those others being the Gershonites and the Merarites.) 22. The crew of the Ephraim squad moved out, organized by their squads, with Elishama, the son of Ammihud, leading them. 23. And Gamaliel, son of Pedahzur, was in charge of the tribe of the children of Manasseh. 24. Leading the crew of the Benjamin squad was Abidan, Gideoni's offspring. 25. So the Dan squad, the rearguard of all the camps, moved out with their crew. Ahiezer, Ammishaddai's son, was in charge of their squad. 26. And leading the tribe of Asher's crew was Pagiel, Ocran's son! 27. And leading the crew of the tribe of the Naphtali peeps was Ahira, Enan's son. 28. So, like, this is how the Israelites moved around with their crew, you know, when they were on the move. Like, they had their squads and all, and that's how they rolled out. And I mean, when I say 'these,' it's like the Hebrew word for 'them,' just so you're in the loop. 29. So Moses was like, 'Yo Hobab, bro. You're Raguel's kid, right? Well, listen up. Our crew is headed to this rad spot that the LORD promised to give us. You should totally roll with us, man. We've got your back and things are gonna be super awesome for Israel, 'cause the LORD's got good things in store!' 30. And he was like, um, no way; I'm totally gonna dip and go back to my own turf and chill with my fam. 31. And he was like, dude, please don't peace out on us. You're our wilderness expert, and you can be our eyes out here, you know? 32. If you come with us, we'll treat you just as well as the LORD treats us! 33. So they left the LORD's mountain and traveled for three whole days. And the sacred ark, representing God's agreement, led the way on this journey, searching for a perfect spot where they could finally rest. 34. And the LORD's cool vibes followed them during the day, whenever they dipped out of the camp. 35. When the ark was on the move, Moses said, 'Yo, Lord, get up and make your enemies peace out and let those who hate you bounce.' 36. And once it stopped, he said, 'Come back, LORD, to the massive crowd of Israel, with countless thousands.' \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 101. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps. 3. And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 4. And if they blow {but} with one {trumpet}, then the princes, {which are} heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee. 5. When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward. 6. When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys. 7. But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. 8. And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. 9. And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies. 10. Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I {am} the LORD your God. 11. And it came to pass on the twentieth {day} of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony. 12. And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran. 13. And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 14. In the first {place} went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host {was} Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 15. And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar {was} Nethaneel the son of Zuar. 16. And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun {was} Eliab the son of Helon. 17. And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle. 18. And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host {was} Elizur the son of Shedeur. 19. And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon {was} Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai. 20. And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad {was} Eliasaph the son of Deuel. 21. And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and {the other} did set up the tabernacle against they came. {the other: that is, the Gershonites and the Merarites} 22. And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host {was} Elishama the son of Ammihud. 23. And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh {was} Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 24. And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin {was} Abidan the son of Gideoni. 25. And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, {which was} the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host {was} Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 26. And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher {was} Pagiel the son of Ocran. 27. And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali {was} Ahira the son of Enan. 28. Thus {were} the journeyings of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward. {Thus: Heb. These} 29. And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel. 30. And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land, and to my kindred. 31. And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes. 32. And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee. 33. And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place for them. 34. And the cloud of the LORD {was} upon them by day, when they went out of the camp. 35. And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee. 36. And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel. {many thousands: Heb. ten thousand thousands} \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 111. So, like, when the people started whining, it really ticked off the LORD. And the LORD totally listened to their complaints, which made him super mad. And then the LORD's anger got so intense, it was like a raging fire that scorched the outskirts of the camp and totally consumed those who were causing all the fuss. (BTW, when I say 'complained', I mean they were kinda acting like complainers, you know? And when I say 'it displeased', I mean it was totally annoying to the LORD.) 2. So the people were like, Mosess, help us!' And Moses was all like, 'Yo, God, can you do something about this fire?' And boom, just like that, the fire was put out. 3. And he was like, 'Okay, let's name this place Taberah, cuz, you know, the fire of the LORD was straight up burning in there.' {Taberah: which literally means fire burning and stuff.} 4. And the diverse group of people who were with them began to crave and desire things they shouldn't: and the children of Israel started crying again, saying, who can provide us with meat to eat? They couldn't help their cravings and started shedding tears again. 5. Yo, we still think about those lit fish we used to grub on back in Egypt like it was no biggie. And don't even get me started on the vibes of them cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic, they were straight fire. 6. But, like, our soul is totally drained: there's legit nothing else here except this manna, right in front of us. 7. The manna looked like tiny coriander seeds and had a color similar to that of bdellium. 8. So, the people went around and collected it, and ground it up in mills, or crushed it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made yummy cakes out of it. And let me tell you, it tasted just as good as fresh oil! 9. And like, when it got all misty at night in the camp, this super cool thing called manna fell from the sky and landed on it, you know? 10. So, like, Moses heard the peeps cryin' all over their fams, with every dude postin' up by their tents. And man, the LORD got super ticked off, which totally didn't sit well with Moses, either. 11. So, like, Moses straight up asked God, 'Why are you making things so hard for me? Did I do something to annoy you or what, because it feels like you're dumping all of these responsibilities on me without showing me any love or support?' 12. Did I give birth to all these people? Am I their creator just so you can ask me to hold them close like a caring father holding a helpless baby, and lead them to the promised land that you promised their ancestors? 13. Where am I supposed to get enough food to feed all these people? They keep crying to me, demanding meat to eat. 14. I can't handle all these people by myself, it's way too overwhelming for me. 15. And, like, if you're gonna keep treating me like this, just end me right now, please. But, hey, only if I've done something to earn your approval. I'd rather not witness how miserable my life has become. 16. So, like, the LORD was talking to Moses and he was like, 'Yo, Moses, round up seventy dudes who are like the OGs of Israel and they're basically in charge, and bring 'em to the tent where we all meet up, so they can stand with you.' 17. And I'll slide into the DMs and have a convo with you there: and I'll download the vibe that you've got, and I'll spread it to them too; and they'll share the load of dealing with the people, so you don't have to carry it all by yourself. 18. Yo, tell the peeps to get themselves ready for tomorrow, 'cause we're about to feast on some delicious meat! Y'all been crying to the Lord, talking about who's gonna hook us up with some meat to eat, like we had it good back in Egypt or something. Well, guess what? The Lord heard ya and He's gonna come through with that meat. So get hyped, 'cause we're about to chow down! 19. Guys, don't even think about indulging in some good eats for just one day, or two days, or five days, not even ten days, or twenty days! 20. Like, seriously, for like a whole month, until it's like coming out of your nose and totally grossing you out: because you straight up dissed the LORD who's right there with you, and like cried to Him saying, 'Why did we even leave Egypt, bro?' 21. So Moses was like, 'Yo, there's like 600k people here, and You're saying You gonna give 'em meat to eat for a whole month? That's wild.' 22. Like, are they seriously expecting us to slaughter a bunch of animals just to feed them? Or are they thinking we can magically gather all the fish in the sea to satisfy their cravings? 23. And God was like, Mosess, seriously? Do you think I suddenly lost my power? Watch and see if what I've said will actually happen or not.' 24. So Moses dipped out and dropped some knowledge on the people, sharing the words of the LORD. He gathered the seventy OGs of the community and had them chill around the tabernacle. 25. And, like, God came down in a totally epic cloud and had a chat with him. Then, God was like, 'Yo dudes, check this out,' and He took some of the mad awesome spirit that was on him and straight up handed it over to the seventy elders. And you won't believe it, but when that spirit landed on them, they started prophesying like non-stop, for real! 26. So there were these two dudes back in the camp, one named Eldad and the other named Medad. But get this, the spirit of God came upon them, even though they didn't go out to the sacred tent like the others. And guess what? They started prophesying right there in the camp! 27. Then this dude came running up to Moses and was like, 'Yo, Eldad and Medad are out here prophesying in the camp! 28. So Joshua, Moses' homie and servant, one of his squad, was like, yo Moses, chill out and don't let them do that. 29. Moses was like, 'Are you jelly of me, bro? I wish everyone was a prophet and had the Lord's spirit on them! How epic would that be! 🙌 30. So Moses went with the squad, him and the OGs of Israel. 31. So like, the Lord sent a really strong wind that brought a bunch of quails from the sea and let them fall all around the camp. It was like a day's journey on one side, and then a day's journey on the other side, surrounding the whole camp. And the quails were like two cubits high above the ground, just covering everything. It was like a huge feast for them! 32. So, like, the people were standing up all day and all night, and even the next day, gathering these quails. The one who collected the least ended up with like ten homers, man! And then they spread them all around the camp, making sure everyone got their share. 33. And just as they were still chewing on the meat, before they even finished it, God got super angry at the people and hit them with a really bad sickness. 34. And he named that place Kibrothhattaavah, 'cause that's where they buried all those pleasure-seekers. {Kibrothhattaavah: which means, The graves of desire} 35. And the squad moved from Kibrothhattaavah to Hazeroth; and crashed at Hazeroth. (crashed: like, they set up camp, you know?) \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 111. And {when} the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard {it}; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed {them that were} in the uttermost parts of the camp. {complained: or, were as it were complainers} {it displeased: Heb. it was evil in the ears of} 2. And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched. {was...: Heb. sunk} 3. And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them. {Taberah: that is, A burning} 4. And the mixt multitude that {was} among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? {fell...: Heb. lusted a lust} {wept...: Heb. returned and wept} 5. We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: 6. But now our soul {is} dried away: {there is} nothing at all, beside this manna, {before} our eyes. 7. And the manna {was} as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium. {colour thereof...: Heb. eye of it as the eye of} 8. {And} the people went about, and gathered {it}, and ground {it} in mills, or beat {it} in a mortar, and baked {it} in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. 9. And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. 10. Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased. 11. And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? 12. Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? 13. Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. 14. I am not able to bear all this people alone, because {it is} too heavy for me. 15. And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness. 16. And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee. 17. And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which {is} upon thee, and will put {it} upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear {it} not thyself alone. 18. And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for {it was} well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. 19. Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; 20. {But} even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which {is} among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? {whole...: Heb. month of days} 21. And Moses said, The people, among whom I {am}, {are} six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. 22. Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? 23. And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD'S hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. 24. And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle. 25. And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that {was} upon him, and gave {it} unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, {that}, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease. 26. But there remained two {of the} men in the camp, the name of the one {was} Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they {were} of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp. 27. And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. 28. And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, {one} of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. 29. And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD'S people were prophets, {and} that the LORD would put his spirit upon them! 30. And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. 31. And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let {them} fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits {high} upon the face of the earth. {as it were a day's...: Heb. as it were the way of a day} 32. And the people stood up all that day, and all {that} night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread {them} all abroad for themselves round about the camp. 33. And while the flesh {was} yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague. 34. And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted. {Kibrothhattaavah: that is, The graves of lust} 35. {And} the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth. {abode at: Heb. they were in} \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 121. So Miriam and Aaron had a problem with Moses because he married an Ethiopian woman. Yeah, he went and tied the knot with someone from Ethiopia! (By the way, Ethiopian means Cushite, just FYI.) 2. And they were like, 'Wait, did God only speak through Moses? Like, didn't He also speak through us?' And then God was like, 'Yup, I totally heard that.' 3. (O-M-G, Moses was, like, hella humble, even more than anyone else on the planet.) 4. So, like, out of nowhere, the LORD was all like, 'Hey Moses, Aaron, Miriam, come meet me at the tabernacle, stat!' And, guess what? Yup, the three of them actually went there, no questions asked. 5. Then God came down from the sky, in a super cool cloud, and stood at the entrance of the holy tent. He called out to Aaron and Miriam, and they both went to Him. 6. Yo, listen up! If there's a prophetic homie among you, I, the LORD, will straight up reveal myself to them in a vision or chat them up in a dream. 7. Moses, my servant, is totally real, like, super reliable in taking care of all my stuff. 8. I'm gonna have a direct convo with him, no shady talk, and he's gonna see a clear vision of the LORD. So why weren't you scared to diss my boy Moses? 9. God got really mad at them, so He stormed off. 10. And the cloud left the tent, and guess what? Miriam suddenly got this skin condition, like really pale, like snow. And Aaron saw Miriam, and, whoa, she had the same skin condition too! 11. Yo Moses, my dude, please don't blame us for this dumb mistake we made and the sin we committed. It's a total facepalm moment, bro. 12. Don't let her be like a total zombie, all flesh half eaten up when she's born. 13. And Moses hit up the big man upstairs like, 'Yo Lord, I'm begging you, can you please fix her up?' 14. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, if her dad just dissed her, wouldn't she be mad embarrassed for a whole week? Kick her out of the squad for a week, and then she can come back and chill with us. 15. So Miriam got excluded from the gang for a whole week, and the squad didn't even move forward without her being let back in. 16. Then the crew bounced from Hazeroth and set up camp in the wildlands of Paran. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 121. And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman. {Ethiopian: or, Cushite} {married: Heb. taken} 2. And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard {it}. 3. (Now the man Moses {was} very meek, above all the men which {were} upon the face of the earth.) 4. And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out. 5. And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood {in} the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth. 6. And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, {I} the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, {and} will speak unto him in a dream. 7. My servant Moses {is} not so, who {is} faithful in all mine house. 8. With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? 9. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed. 10. And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam {became} leprous, {white} as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, {she was} leprous. 11. And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned. 12. Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother's womb. 13. And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee. 14. And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in {again}. 15. And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in {again}. 16. And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 131. So like, God was all like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,' 2. Yo, pick some peeps to scope out Canaan, the land I'm hookin' up to the children of Israel. Send a representative from each tribe, ya know, a legit leader. 3. So Moses, following God's orders, sent them out from the wildnerness of Paran. All of those guys were leaders of the Israelite squad. 4. And these were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua, who was the son of Zaccur. 5. Representing the squad of Simeon, we have Shaphat, Hori's offspring. 6. Representing Judah, we got Caleb, son of Jephunneh. 7. Igal, the dude who's Joseph's son, represents the tribe of Issachar. 8. Representing the Ephraim fam, we got Oshea, AKA Joshua, the son of Nun. 9. Representing Benjamin, we got Palti, the offspring of Raphu. 10. Representing the Zebulun squad, we got Gaddiel, Sodi's offspring in the mix. 11. Representing Team Joseph, specifically from the squad of Manasseh, we have Gaddi, Susi's child. 12. Ammiel, the son of Gemalli, representing the Dan tribe. 13. Representin' the Asher squad, we got Sethur holdin' it down as Michael's son. 14. Representing the Naphtali squad, we got Nahbi, Vophsi's offspring. 15. Representin' the tribe of Gad, we got Geuel, son of Machi. 16. These are the guys that Moses sent to scope out the land. And Moses gave Oshea, aka Joshua, the nickname Jehoshua. 17. So Moses sent them to check out the land of Canaan and told them, 'Go up this road in the south and head towards the mountains.' 18. Check out the land and peep the scene, see who's living there - are they flexin' or kinda weak, a small squad or a massive crew? 19. So, like, they were checking out the land where these people live, you know? They wanted to know if it was a good place or a total dump. And they also wanted to scope out the cities they were living in—whether they were chilling in tents or hiding out in fortresses, you feel me? 20. Yo, check out what the land is like. Is it rich or nah? Any dope trees around? Don't be scared, fam. Confidence is key. Bring back some tasty fruits from the land. It's grape season, y'all! 21. So they went up and explored the land from the desert of Zin all the way to Rehob, like people reaching Hamath. 22. So, they headed south and reached Hebron where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, who were the children of Anak, were chilling. (By the way, Hebron was actually built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 23. So they went to this really cool place called Eshcol and found this huge bunch of grapes. They decided to carry it on a stick together with their friends. Also, they picked some pomegranates and figs! 24. That spot got the name Eshcol, 'cause it had a mad bunch of grapes that the Israelite crew snatched up. {brook: or, valley} {Eshcol: as in, A cluster of grapes} 25. And after like, 40 days of checking out the land, they came back, you know? 26. So they went and met up with Moses, Aaron, and all the Israelites out in the wilderness of Paran, at Kadesh. They reported to them and showed everyone the awesome fruit they had found. 27. So we were like, 'Hey, we went to that place you sent us to, and dude, it's amazing! It's full of good stuff like milk and honey. And check out these fruits we brought back! 28. But yo, the peeps living in that land be mad strong, and the cities be like protected with hella big walls and all. Plus, we spotted these straight-up giants, the children of Anak, in there. 29. Bruh, the Amalekites are chilling down in the southern lands, while the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites are posted up in the mountains. The Canaanites are holding it down by the sea and the coast of Jordan, you feel me? 30. So Caleb gathered everyone around Moses and said, 'Yo, let's charge straight up and claim that land as ours! We got this, fam. We totally have what it takes to conquer it!' 31. But the dudes who rolled with him were like, nah bro, we can't take on those people 'cause they're way more buff than us. 32. So, they totally trashed the land they explored to the Israelites, saying, 'Dude, this place totally eats people alive! And the people we saw there? Taller than giants, man!' 33. So like, we saw these super tall dudes, the sons of Anak, who were like descendants of even taller dudes. And you know what? We felt so tiny, like grasshoppers, compared to them. And it seemed like that's how they saw us too. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 131. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them. 3. And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men {were} heads of the children of Israel. 4. And these {were} their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. 5. Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. 6. Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 7. Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. 8. Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. {Oshea: also called, Joshua} 9. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 10. Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. 11. Of the tribe of Joseph, {namely}, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi. 12. Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 13. Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. 14. Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. 15. Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 16. These {are} the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua. {Oshea: also called Joshua} {Jehoshua: or, Joshua} 17. And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this {way} southward, and go up into the mountain: 18. And see the land, what it {is}; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they {be} strong or weak, few or many; 19. And what the land {is} that they dwell in, whether it {be} good or bad; and what cities {they be} that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; 20. And what the land {is}, whether it {be} fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time {was} the time of the firstripe grapes. 21. So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath. 22. And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, {were}. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 23. And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and {they brought} of the pomegranates, and of the figs. {brook: or, valley} 24. The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence. {brook: or, valley} {Eshcol: that is, A cluster of grapes} 25. And they returned from searching of the land after forty days. 26. And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land. 27. And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this {is} the fruit of it. 28. Nevertheless the people {be} strong that dwell in the land, and the cities {are} walled, {and} very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there. 29. The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. 30. And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. 31. But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they {are} stronger than we. 32. And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, {is} a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it {are} men of a great stature. {men...: Heb. men of statures} 33. And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, {which come} of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 141. And like, everyone in the group started shouting and crying, and the peeps were super emotional that night. 2. And all the Israelite kids were like ugh, Moses and Aaron are so annoying. The whole crew was like, I wish we were dead in Egypt! No wait, I wish we were dead in this boring wilderness! 3. Why did God bring us to this place just to get killed and let our families be taken captive? Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt? 4. And they were like, yo, let's choose a leader and bounce back to Egypt. 5. So Moses and Aaron totally dropped to the ground in front of everyone, like, the whole crew of Israelite peeps. 6. Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, who were part of the land scouting crew, tore their clothes in distress. 7. So they said to all the squad of Israel, like, yo, the land we checked out is legit amazing, no cap. 8. If God thinks we're cool, he'll totally hook us up with this awesome land that's like super abundant, with milk and honey all flowing and stuff. 9. Don't go against the LORD, and don't be scared of the people in the land. They're basically no match for us. They have no protection, but we have the LORD on our side. So, don't be afraid of them. 10. But everyone there was like, 'Let's pelt them with stones!' Then, out of nowhere, God's amazing presence showed up in the meeting place where everyone could see, right in front of the whole Israelite crew. 11. Yo, Moses! Seriously, how much longer are these people gonna keep testing my patience? Like, when will they finally have some faith in me, especially after all the crazy miracles I've shown them? 12. I'm gonna hit them with a major plague, kick them out of their land, and turn you into a way cooler nation that's way more powerful than them. 13. So Moses was like, 'Yo God, if we do this, the Egyptians gonna hear about it and they gonna be shook 'cause you straight flexed your power and brought the Israelites out from among them and all.' 14. And they'll be like, 'Yo, the people of this place need to know that the Lord is with them. They've heard that the Lord is chilling right here, like no distance. The Lord's cloud is always over them, leading the way during the day as a cloud and at night as fire. 15. Yo, if you straight up wipe out these peeps like they're all just one person, then all these nations who've heard about you gonna be like, 16. So, like, God couldn't actually get these people into the land He promised them. That's why He ended up, you know, taking them out in the wilderness and stuff. 17. Yo, I'm humbly asking you to flex your mad power, just like you promised, 18. God is super patient, totally merciful, forgives all the bad stuff we do, but makes sure justice is served. Sometimes the consequences of our ancestors' wrongdoings can affect us too, for a few generations. 19. Like, oh my gosh, please forgive the wrongdoings of these peeps in the most epic way possible, just as you have forgiven them since the time they left Egypt until now. (or, like, until now or whatever) 20. And God was like, 'You know what? I'm totally forgiving you, just like you asked!' 21. I swear, bro, the entire world will be lit with the glory of the LORD. 22. So, like, all those dudes who witnessed the epicness of my divine awesomeness and witnessed the sick miracles I pulled off back in Egypt and the wild, they've straight-up tested me ten times now and totally ignored what I've been saying. 23. I tell you, they won't even catch a glimpse of the promised land I promised their ancestors. Those who've been giving me trouble won't see it either. #NoLandForThem #PromisedButNotDelivered 24. But my dude Caleb, because he had this whole different vibe going on, and straight up followed me to the max, I'm gonna bring him into the land he checked out; and his offspring will totally own it. 25. So, like, there were these Amalekites and Canaanites chillin' in the valley, you know? Tomorrow, head out to the wilderness via the Red Sea route, fam. 26. So like, the LORD was talking to Moses and Aaron, right? And He's all like, 27. Yo, how much longer do I have to put up with this whack group of people who keep complaining about me? I've been hearing their constant complaints, like, seriously, why are the children of Israel always dissing me? 28. Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD is sayin': I swear on my life, whatever you've been chattin' about, I'ma make it happen, no cap. 29. Y'all gonna drop dead in this desert; all of you, from 20 and up, who complained about me, will be taken out, and I totally counted every single one of you. 30. For sure, you guys won't enter the land that I promised to give you as a place to live, except for Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun. Just so you know, I made a solemn commitment to this. 31. But those younger ones you thought would be left behind as victims, I will bring them in and they will experience the land that you underestimated. 32. But like, you guys, your bodies are totally gonna drop dead in this desert. 33. And your kids will be stuck in the desert for, like, forty years, dealing with the consequences of your messed up choices, until you all basically die out there. *shrugs* 34. Once you finished exploring the land, which took a total of forty days (that's, like, a year for each day), you'll have to deal with the consequences of your wrongdoings for the next forty years. And during that time, you'll come to realize how I had to change my plans because of your actions. 35. Yo, the LORD Himself promised that He's gonna totally wreck this entire messed up group of people that have gathered against Me. Like, in this wilderness, they're gonna meet their end and kick the bucket right here. 36. So like, those guys that Moses sent to check out the land totally came back and started stirring up drama among all the people by spreading lies about it. 37. Like, those guys who spread negativity about the land totally didn't make it, they got hit with a major plague in front of the LORD. 38. But Joshua, the OG son of Nun, and Caleb, the cool son of Jephunneh, were part of the squad that checked out the land, and they were still killing it. 39. So Moses pulled the squad together and dropped these truth bombs on all the Israelites. And let me tell you, the whole crew was in serious feels mode, like major mourning vibes. 40. So, like, they woke up super early in the morning and headed to the tippy top of the mountain, being like, 'Yo, we're here and we're totally gonna reach the place that the LORD promised us, 'cause we messed up, man.' 41. Yo, Moses was like, why y'all gotta go against the LORD's commandment? But let me tell ya, it ain't gonna work out for you. 42. Don't even think about heading up there, because the LORD ain't gonna be there with you. You'll end up getting totally wrecked by your enemies. 43. Yo, listen up! The Amalekites and Canaanites are chillin' in that place ahead of ya, and y'all gonna get wrecked by the sword. It's 'cause you've straight-up abandoned the LORD, so He ain't gonna roll with you no more. 44. But they decided to go up to the hilltop, even though the sacred box of the LORD's covenant and Moses stayed in the camp. 45. So the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that area came down and totally destroyed them, all the way to Hormah. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 141. And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. 2. And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! 3. And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? 4. And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. 5. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. 6. And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, {which were} of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 7. And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, {is} an exceeding good land. 8. If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. 9. Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they {are} bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD {is} with us: fear them not. {defence: Heb. shadow} 10. But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel. 11. And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them? 12. I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they. 13. And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear {it}, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) 14. And they will tell {it} to the inhabitants of this land: {for} they have heard that thou LORD {art} among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and {that} thy cloud standeth over them, and {that} thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. 15. Now {if} thou shalt kill {all} this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 16. Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. 17. And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, 18. The LORD {is} longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing {the guilty}, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth {generation}. 19. Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. {until...: or, hitherto} 20. And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 21. But {as} truly {as} I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD. 22. Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 23. Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: {Surely...: Heb. If they see the land} 24. But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. 25. (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. 26. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 27. How long {shall I bear with} this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. 28. Say unto them, {As truly as} I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 29. Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me, 30. Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, {concerning} which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. {sware: Heb. lifted up my hand} 31. But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. 32. But {as for} you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. 33. And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. {wander: or, feed} 34. After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, {even} forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, {even} forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. {breach...: or, altering of my purpose} 35. I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. 36. And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, 37. Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. 38. But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, {which were} of the men that went to search the land, lived {still}. 39. And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. 40. And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we {be here}, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned. 41. And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper. 42. Go not up, for the LORD {is} not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies. 43. For the Amalekites and the Canaanites {are} there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you. 44. But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. 45. Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, {even} unto Hormah. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 151. And God started talking to Moses, like, 2. Yo, listen up, all you Israelites! So, when you finally step foot into the sweet land I'm hooking you up with for your homes, 3. And you shall offer a lit fire to the LORD, like a sick burn or a flex for keeping a promise, or for doing something on your own, or during lit celebrations, to make it super dope for the LORD. Whether it's from your squad or your crew, it's all good! {separating: separating it from everything else} 4. Yo, if someone wants to offer a gift to the LORD, they gotta bring a lit meat offering. It's gotta be like one-tenth of flour mixed with one-fourth of oil, ya know? 5. And you're gonna need like a fourth of a hin of wine - seriously, just a lil' bit - for a drink offering to go with the burnt offering or sacrifice, ya know, when you bring in one lamb. 6. Dude, if you're sacrificing a ram, you gotta bring like two tenth deals of flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil as an offering, ya know? 7. And when it comes to offering a drink, you gotta bring about one-third of a hin of wine. It's gotta be a real sweet scent for the LORD. 8. And when you're getting ready to offer a bullock to God as a burnt offering, or as a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or as peace offerings to the LORD: 9. Then he should bring, like, a bullock and offer three tenth deals of flour mixed with half a hin of oil. 10. And you gotta pour in half a hin of wine as a drink offering, like an offering that's lit and pleases the Lord. 11. So this is how it should be for one bullock, or one ram, or a lamb, or a kid. 👌 12. Just do it; give everyone what they deserve based on how many they are. 13. So, like, everyone who's from around here should totally follow these rules when they bring their fire offerings, you know? They gotta make sure it's all tasty and pleasing to the LORD. 14. And if a random person comes chill with you, or anyone who's part of your squad, and wants to make a lit offering by burning something tasty for the LORD, they gotta follow the same vibes as you do. 15. Here's the deal, fam: the same rules go for all of y'all in the community, whether you're a local or just visiting. This rule is gonna stick around forever, for all generations. Just remember, the way you're treated by the big man upstairs, the strangers among you get the same treatment. No exceptions. 16. We all follow the same rules, whether you're chillin' with us or you're a visitor. 17. So, like, God was talking to Moses and stuff, and He was like, 18. Yo, listen up, Israelites! Hear this from the man upstairs: Once you arrive in the promised land that I'm taking you to, 19. So, like, when you chow down on that bread from the land, you gotta make sure to give an offering to the LORD, you know? 20. Yo, gotta give up a lit cake made from the first of yo dough as an offering. Like the offering from the threshingfloor, ya gotta lift it up, ya feel me? 21. Always remember to dedicate a portion of your dough as an offering to the LORD for generations to come. 22. And if you've messed up and haven't followed all these rules that the LORD told Moses, 23. Like, every single thing that the Lord told you through Moses, starting from way back when He first commanded Moses and continuing on throughout the generations, ya know? 24. So, like, if anyone does something dumb without even realizing it, and nobody else knows about it, the whole crew should come together and offer a lit young bull as a burnt offering to the Lord, along with a meal and a refreshing drink, just like the usual vibe. Also, bring a cool goat as a sin offering. It's, like, the way we do things, you know? 25. And the priest gotta make everything cool for the whole squad of the Israelite peeps, and they'll get forgiven 'cause, you know, they just didn't know. And they gotta bring their own offering, like a lit fire sacrifice to the big man upstairs, and also their sin offering, 'cause of the whole not-knowing situation. 26. And like, everyone in the Israel fam and even the visitors who chill with them will totally be forgiven. 'Cause, you know, they were all just clueless and didn't know any better. 27. If someone messes up unintentionally, they gotta bring a young she goat as an offering to make up for the sin, ya feel me? 28. The priest will fix things up for someone who messes up unknowingly, if they mess up without knowing it in front of the LORD. The priest will make things right for them and they'll be forgiven. 29. Everyone's gotta follow the same rules, whether you're an Israelite or just visiting. It doesn't matter if you mess up accidentally or if you were born here, the law treats everyone the same. 30. But if someone intentionally does something they know is wrong, whether they were born here or not, they're disrespecting the LORD and will be rejected by their community. 31. If someone disses the word of the LORD and breaks his commandment, they're out. Their mistakes are on them. 32. So, like, when the Israelites were out there in the wilderness, they came across this dude who was picking up sticks on the sabbath day. 33. So, like, these peeps caught this guy picking up sticks and were all like, 'dude, you're breaking the rules.' So they took him to Moses, Aaron, and the whole crew. 34. So they locked him up, because they weren't sure what to do with him yet. 35. Then God told Moses, like, this guy seriously deserves death. So, the whole crew gotta grab some rocks and throw 'em at him outside the camp. 36. So, like, the whole crew took him outside the camp and straight up threw rocks at him until he kicked the bucket. It was totally what the LORD told Moses to do. 37. So God was like, talking to Moses, and He was like, 38. Yo, listen up Israelites! Tell 'em to add some lit fringes to the ends of their clothes, and make sure to rock a sick blue ribbon on those fringes. This style is gonna be passed down for generations, fam! 39. And this is like a reminder for you, so you always remember God's commandments and actually follow them. It's a way to keep yourself from getting distracted by your own desires and wandering off track. 40. So you don't forget, follow all my rules and be totally devoted to your God. 41. Yo, I'm the LORD your God, the one who snatched you out of Egypt and became your ultimate squad. I'm always gonna be the LORD your God, no doubt. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 151. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, 3. And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock: {performing: Heb. separating} 4. Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth {part} of an hin of oil. 5. And the fourth {part} of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb. 6. Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare {for} a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third {part} of an hin of oil. 7. And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third {part} of an hin of wine, {for} a sweet savour unto the LORD. 8. And when thou preparest a bullock {for} a burnt offering, or {for} a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: 9. Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil. 10. And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, {for} an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 11. Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid. 12. According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every one according to their number. 13. All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 14. And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever {be} among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do. 15. One ordinance {shall be both} for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth {with you}, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye {are}, so shall the stranger be before the LORD. 16. One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth with you. 17. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you, 19. Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD. 20. Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough {for} an heave offering: as {ye do} the heave offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it. 21. Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering in your generations. 22. And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 23. {Even} all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded {Moses}, and henceforward among your generations; 24. Then it shall be, if {ought} be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering. {without...: Heb. from the eyes} {manner: or, ordinance} 25. And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it {is} ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance: 26. And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people {were} in ignorance. 27. And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering. 28. And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him. 29. Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, {both for} him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them. {sinneth: Heb. doth} 30. But the soul that doeth {ought} presumptuously, {whether he be} born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people. {presumptuously: Heb. with an high hand} 31. Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity {shall be} upon him. 32. And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. 33. And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 34. And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him. 35. And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. 36. And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses. 37. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 38. Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 39. And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring: 40. That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. 41. I {am} the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I {am} the LORD your God. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 161. So this dude named Korah, who was the son of Izhar, who was the son of Kohath, who was the son of Levi, along with Dathan and Abiram, who were the sons of Eliab, and On, who was the son of Peleth, and also sons of Reuben, they got together a group of people: 2. And then these guys, like, totally confronted Moses, right? It was, like, two hundred and fifty top dogs from the Israel crew. They were, like, basically famous in the squad, well-known and all that. 3. So like, the whole crew got together and started beefing with Moses and Aaron, telling them they're acting all high and mighty. They were like, 'Why do you think you're so special? We're all chosen by the Lord and He's with us!' They basically called them out for thinking they're better than the rest of us. 4. And when Moses heard that, he face-planted: 5. And he was like, yo Korah and all his homies, listen up. Tomorrow, the LORD is gonna flex and make it clear who's on his team and who's holy. He'll bring them close to him, like VIP status – the ones he's chosen. 6. Okay, listen up fam! Grab those censers, Korah, and everyone in his crew! 7. And like, you gotta add fire and incense in there, in front of the LORD tomorrow, okay? And it's gonna be like, whoever the LORD chooses, that dude is gonna be totally holy. So, like, chill out guys, you sons of Levi, you're doing too much. 8. Yo, Moses be like, listen up, fam. I'm talking to you, my fellow Levi homies: 9. Seriously, dude, is it no biggie to you that the God of Israel chose y'all over everyone else to join His crew and do important stuff at His HQ, the tabernacle of the LORD? You get to be up front and center, serving the congregation and doing your thing. Cool or what? 10. And he's like, yo, he's bringing you close to him, and all your homies from the tribe of Levi too. And he's asking, are you guys also trying to join the priesthood? 11. Yo, why are you and your whole crew straight up hating on the LORD? And why you gotta complain about Aaron like that, for real? 12. So Moses hit up Dathan and Abiram, Eliab's sons, and they straight up said, 'Nah, we ain't showing up!' 13. Like, are you seriously gonna kill us here in the desert after bringing us out of a totally awesome land flowing with milk and honey? Unless you're planning to make yourself the ultimate ruler, that's like totally extra. 14. And, like, you totally didn't bring us to a rad land filled with epic stuff like milk and honey, or hook us up with sweet fields and vineyards. Are you seriously trying to blindside us here? Sorry, but we're not down to go along with that plan. #NoThanks 15. Moses got mad AF and was like, Yo God, don't even bother with their lame offering. I never asked for a single donkey from them and I haven't harmed any of them either. 16. So Moses said to Korah, yo gather up yourself, your squad, and Aaron, and come before the LORD, like tomorrow, fam: 17. Yo, everyone grab your censers and fill 'em up with incense. Then bring 'em all before the LORD - two hundred and fifty censers in total. And don't forget, both you and Aaron gotta bring your own censers too! 18. So they each grabbed their censers, filled them with fire, put incense on top, and stood at the entrance of the tabernacle with Moses and Aaron. 19. So Korah got everyone together and brought them to the entrance of the sacred tent. Then, BAM! The Lord's divine presence showed up and all the people saw it. 20. So God was like, 'Yo, Moses and Aaron, listen up,' 21. Yo, y'all better bounce from this squad ASAP, 'cause I'm about to straight up obliterate 'em in a hot sec. 22. And they totally dropped to the ground and were like, Yo God, the God of all the vibes and energies of everyone, is it fair for just one person to mess up and then you get mad at the whole squad? 23. And God like totally talked to Moses, and He was all like, 'Yo, listen up,' 24. Yo, gather 'round and listen up! It's time to bounce from the area near the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. 25. So Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the older guys from Israel went with him. 26. So he talked to all the people and was like, 'Yo, listen up! Peace out from the wicked dudes' spot and don't even touch their stuff. 'Cause if you do, you might end up getting wrecked by all their bad vibes. 27. So they left the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram from all directions: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the entrance of their tents, with their wives, and their sons, and their little children. 28. And Moses was like, listen up fam, this is how you'll know that the big man upstairs sent me to pull off all these crazy miracles. It ain't like I came up with this stuff all on my own, I'm just doing what He told me to do. 29. If these dudes just bite the dust like everyone else, or end up getting a regular ol' visit from fate like everyone else, then it's clear the LORD didn't send me. Like, if they face the same end as anyone else, this whole thing is not divine or anything. #justsaying #keepitreal 30. But if the LORD does something totally new and the earth straight up opens its mouth to swallow them and everything they own, and they disappear into the abyss in a flash, then you'll finally get it that these dudes seriously ticked off the LORD. Just sayin', it's a whole new level of divine wrath. 31. And then, like, as soon as he finished saying all that stuff, the freaking ground just split open right below them, you know? 32. And like, the earth just like, opened up and, you know, swallowed them and all their houses, and like, everyone who was with Korah, like, all their stuff too. 33. Like, they and everything they had, straight up went down into the pit, and then the earth closed over them and they were totally wiped out from the whole group. 34. And all the people of Israel who were nearby ran away when they heard them shouting, because they were afraid the ground would swallow them too. 35. Dude, like, the LORD totally set off this wild fire that totally wiped out those 250 dudes who were all into offering incense and stuff. 36. So, like, God had a chat with Moses and was all like, 37. Yo, tell Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, to grab the censers from the fire and toss that fire over there. It's all sacred and stuff. 38. Those who messed up big time should take those censers, the ones they used to mess up, and turn them into these cool plates to cover the altar. Since they used those censers in front of the LORD, they're now all special and holy. It'll be like a reminder to the children of Israel of what went down. 39. So Eleazar, the priest, grabbed those cool bronze censers that were used to burn offerings, and they were repurposed into these sick, wide plates to cover the altar: 40. This is a reminder for all the Israelites that only descendants of Aaron can offer incense to the LORD. Nobody else should try to do it, or they'll end up like Korah and his crew, just as the LORD warned through Moses. 41. But the next day, the whole crew of Israel's squad started throwing shade at Moses and Aaron, like, 'Yo, you straight up killed the LORD's peeps.' 42. So, like, everyone got together and they were all, like, mad at Moses and Aaron. And then they started looking at the tabernacle, and guess what? There was this big cloud that totally covered it, and then boom! The glory of the LORD was there for everyone to see. 43. So Moses and Aaron pulled up to the meeting spot outside the big tent. 44. And God was like, 'YO, Moses! Listen up!' 45. Yo, bounce out from this crew so I can totally wipe 'em out in a sec. And they straight up hit the ground, face down. 46. Yo, Aaron! Grab a censer, take some fire from the altar, toss in some incense, and hustle over to the crew. They need some serious soul-cleansing ASAP. The Lord's pretty ticked off right now, and it's already starting to get messy with the plague. 47. So Aaron did what Moses told him to do and quickly went into the middle of the crowd. And guess what? The plague had already started affecting the people. But Aaron didn't waste any time – he lit some incense and made things right by seeking forgiveness for the people. 48. And he like, totally stepped up, bruh, right in the middle of the casualties and the survivors, and BOOM, the plague just stopped dead in its tracks. No more chaos, man. 49. So, like, there were a total of 14,700 peeps who sadly lost their lives due to the plague. And that's not even counting the ones who died because of what went down with Korah. 50. So Aaron went back to Moses at the entrance of the gathering place, and the plague stopped. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 161. Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took {men}: 2. And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: 3. And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, {Ye take} too much upon you, seeing all the congregation {are} holy, every one of them, and the LORD {is} among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD? {Ye take...: Heb. It is much for you} 4. And when Moses heard {it}, he fell upon his face: 5. And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who {are} his, and {who is} holy; and will cause {him} to come near unto him: even {him} whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him. 6. This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 7. And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be {that} the man whom the LORD doth choose, he {shall be} holy: {ye take} too much upon you, ye sons of Levi. 8. And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi: 9. {Seemeth it but} a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them? 10. And he hath brought thee near {to him}, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also? 11. For which cause {both} thou and all thy company {are} gathered together against the LORD: and what {is} Aaron, that ye murmur against him? 12. And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up: 13. {Is it} a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us? 14. Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up. {put...: Heb. bore out} 15. And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them. 16. And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 17. And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each {of you} his censer. 18. And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron. 19. And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation. 20. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 21. Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. 22. And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation? 23. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 24. Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. 25. And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. 26. And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins. 27. So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children. 28. And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for {I have} not {done them} of mine own mind. 29. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; {then} the LORD hath not sent me. {the common...: Heb. as every man dieth} 30. But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that {appertain} unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD. {make...: Heb. create a creature} 31. And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that {was} under them: 32. And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that {appertained} unto Korah, and all {their} goods. 33. They, and all that {appertained} to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation. 34. And all Israel that {were} round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up {also}. 35. And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense. 36. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 37. Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed. 38. The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates {for} a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel. 39. And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad {plates for} a covering of the altar: 40. {To be} a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which {is} not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses. 41. But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD. 42. And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared. 43. And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation. 44. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 45. Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces. 46. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun. 47. And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people. 48. And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 49. Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah. 50. And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 171. Yo, the Big Man upstairs gave Moses the lowdown, he was like, 2. Yo, guys and gals of Israel, listen up! So, grab a rod from each one of y'all, like your pops or grandpops, doesn't matter, just make sure it's from your fam tree. And here's the deal, we need twelve rods, one from each prince in the fam. Oh, and don't forget to write your name on your rod, alrighty? 3. And you gotta scribble Aaron's name on the Levi's rod: 'cause one rod is gonna represent the big boss of their family house. 4. And like, you gotta store them in the tabernacle of the congregation, right in front of the testimony, where I'm gonna meet up with you.  5. So, like, here's the deal, the chosen dude's stick is totally gonna bloom, and I'll shut down all the whining from the Israelites who keep complaining about you. 6. So Moses talked to the kids of Israel, and every prince gave him a cool stick, one for each prince, based on their fam's crib. There were like twelve sticks in total, and Aaron's stick was part of the bunch. (just like, one stick per prince, ya know) 7. So Moses put the rods in front of the LORD in the chill tabernacle. 8. So the next day, Moses went into the tabernacle of witness, and guess what? Aaron's rod for the house of Levi had sprouted, with buds, blossoms, and even almonds growing on it! 9. So Moses got all the rods and showed them to the Israelites, and they checked them out and each person took their own rod. 10. So, God told Moses to bring Aaron's staff back and put it in front of the sacred chest as a reminder for those who rebel against Him. This will help put an end to all their complaining and prevent any more deaths. 11. So Moses did it, exactly as the LORD told him to. 12. So the Israelites were like, 'Yo, Moses, listen up! We're literally gonna die, like, we're totally doomed, straight up.' 13. Like, anyone who gets too close to the LORD's pad is toast! Are we seriously gonna get smoked? \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 171. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of {their} fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod. 3. And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod {shall be} for the head of the house of their fathers. 4. And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you. 5. And it shall come to pass, {that} the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you. 6. And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, {even} twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron {was} among their rods. {a rod...: Heb. a rod for one prince, a rod for one prince} 7. And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness. 8. And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds. 9. And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod. 10. And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. {rebels: Heb. children of rebellion} 11. And Moses did {so}: as the LORD commanded him, so did he. 12. And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish. 13. Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying? \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 181. Yo, Aaron, listen up. You and your homies, along with your pops and fam, gotta take responsibility for all the wrong stuff that goes down in the sanctuary. And don't forget, you and your crew are accountable for any mistakes made in your priest game. 2. And, like, make sure you bring your bros from the tribe of Levi, which is like your dad's tribe, so they can, like, join you and serve you. But you and your squad, you'll be the ones serving in front of the tabernacle, yo. 3. And they gotta stay on top of all your responsibilities, making sure everything in the tabernacle is in order. Just remember, they can't go near the sacred stuff and the altar, otherwise they, and even you, might end up bite the dust. 4. And they're gonna be on your squad, keeping the tabernacle game strong, taking care of all the tabernacle duties. And no random person gonna be getting close to y'all, for real. 5. And you gotta make sure you look after the sanctuary and the altar, so there's no more anger vibes directed towards the kids of Israel. 6. Yo, check it out, I've got your bros, the Levites, taken 'em from the Israelite squad. They're a straight-up gift for the LORD, assigned to handle the duties at the tabernacle. 7. So, like, you and your homies gotta be responsible for doing all the priestly stuff at the altar and behind the curtain. It's your job, ya know? Consider it a special gift, bro. Oh, and if some random person tries to do your job, they'll face the ultimate consequence. 8. Yo, Aaron, listen up. I'm hooking you up with the responsibility of handling all the sacred offerings from the peeps of Israel. I'm giving them to you and your squad because of the special anointing, and it's gonna be a forever thing. 9. These are the legit sacred stuff that can't be burned: all their offerings, food offerings, sin offerings, and trespass offerings that they give to me are like super holy for you and your squad. 10. You gotta chow down on this holy food in the holiest hangout spot. All the bros gotta eat it, no exceptions. This grub is sacred for you, no joking around. 11. So, this is yours, like a cool gift from the Israelites, all these awesome offerings that they're waving around. I've totally given them to you, your kids, and even your daughters—forever! Oh, and just to be clear, anyone who's chill and pure in your fam can have a feast with it. 12. I've hooked you up with the top-notch oil, the premium wine, and the freshest wheat—the cream of the crop that they'll be offering to the LORD. 13. Like, whatever is the first and best from the land, that you bring to the LORD, is totally yours. All the cool people in your house can totally chow down on it. 14. You totally get to keep anything dedicated in Israel. 15. Yo, anything that comes out first from humans or animals, like babies and stuff, that the people bring to the LORD, it's all gonna be yours. But wait, you gotta make sure to redeem the firstborn of humans and the firstling of unclean animals, gotta save 'em or buy 'em back, you know? 16. And anyone who needs to be redeemed from the age of one month onward, you should redeem them by paying five shekels, based on your estimate, using the value of the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty gerahs. 17. But yo, don't even think about cashing in on a firstborn cow, sheep, or goat, cuz they're sacred, you feel? Gotta sprinkle their blood on the altar, and burn up their fat as a fire offering that smells hella good to the LORD. 18. You can totally have their flesh, like it's yours, just like you own the wave breast and the right shoulder. 19. Yo, all the dope offerings that the Israelites give to the LORD, I've given to you and your squad sonss and daughters included), forever and ever. It's like a legit salty covenant before the LORD, for you and your fam, and for generations to come. No cap. 20. And God said to Aaron, Dude, you won't get any land or be a part of their stuff. But guess what? I am your squad and your ultimate inheritance among the peeps of Israel. 21. Yo, check it out, I've hooked up the Levi tribe with a solid 10% of all the stuff in Israel as their rightful share for the work they put in, specifically for all the tasks they handle in running the tabernacle where everyone gathers. 22. Yo, Israel fam, y'all can't be going near the tabernacle anymore, unless you wanna carry sin on your shoulders and end up dead. Like, seriously, dead. (And I mean dead, dead, no cap). 23. Yo, the Levites are responsible for handling all the stuff related to the meeting place and they gotta take responsibility for any wrong they do. This rule is gonna be in place forever for all y'all future generations of Israelites, 'cause the Levites ain't gonna get any land inheritance like the others. 24. So, like, the Israelites do this thing called tithing, where they give a portion of their stuff as an offering to the LORD. And, instead of the Israelites keeping it for themselves, like an inheritance, I've given it to the Levites. So now, they won't have their own inheritance among the Israelites, you know? 25. Yo, God came through for Moses and said, 26. Yo, listen up Levites! When you're collecting tithes from the peeps of Israel, the ones I've set aside for you as your inheritance, make sure to give a portion of it as a special offering to the LORD. It's, like, one tenth of the whole tithe, ya feel me? 27. And you should totally count this awesome contribution of yours as if it were the sickest harvest from your farm or the raddest amount of juice from your winery. 28. So, like, you gotta give a sick offering to the LORD from all your tithes that you get from the Israel peeps. And then, make sure to give the LORD's offering to Aaron the priest, ya know? 29. You gotta offer up all the awesome stuff you got as an offering to the Lord, like the best of the best. Make sure it’s super holy and separated from the rest. (The 'best' here means the super fatty parts!) 30. So, here's what you gotta tell them: Once you've set aside the absolute best stuff, that's when it gets credited to the Levites as a boost to their income. It's like the bonus from the threshingfloor and the winepress. {best: Hebrew for 'fat'} 31. So, like, you and your peeps can totally chow down on this food anywhere, like, wherever you want, in your crib and stuff. ‘Cause this is, like, your payday for being so dedicated to serving in the hangout spot known as the tabernacle. 32. And don't worry, you won't be sinning if you've set aside the best part of it. Also, make sure you don't mess with any sacred things that belong to the Israelites, unless you want to face some serious consequences. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 181. And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. 2. And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee {shall minister} before the tabernacle of witness. 3. And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die. 4. And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you. 5. And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel. 6. And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you {they are} given {as} a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 7. Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office {unto you} as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 8. And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever. 9. This shall be thine of the most holy things, {reserved} from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, {shall be} most holy for thee and for thy sons. 10. In the most holy {place} shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy unto thee. 11. And this {is} thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it. 12. All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I given thee. {best: Heb. fat} 13. {And} whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat {of} it. 14. Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. 15. Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, {whether it be} of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. 16. And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which {is} twenty gerahs. 17. But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they {are} holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat {for} an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 18. And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine. 19. All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it {is} a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee. 20. And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I {am} thy part and thine inheritance among the children of Israel. 21. And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, {even} the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 22. Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die. {and die: Heb. to die} 23. But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: {it shall be} a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance. 24. But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer {as} an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance. 25. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 26. Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, {even} a tenth {part} of the tithe. 27. And {this} your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though {it were} the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress. 28. Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the LORD'S heave offering to Aaron the priest. 29. Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, {even} the hallowed part thereof out of it. {best: Heb. fat} 30. Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress. {best: Heb. fat} 31. And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it {is} your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation. 32. And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 191. So God talked to Moses and Aaron, like, legit said, 2. Yo, here's the deal from the Big Guy upstairs: He's telling the Israelites to find a totally flawless, spotless, never-been-used-for-work red heifer. That's the law, fam, so spread the word! 3. And you gotta hand her over to Eleazar the priest, so he can take her outta the camp and one of you should take her down right in front of him: 4. Then Eleazar the priest will take some of her blood and sprinkle it directly in front of the meeting tent seven times: 5. And someone will totally incinerate that heifer right in front of them; like, every inch of the skin, flesh, blood, and even the poop gotta go up in flames, no joke: 6. Then the priest grabs some cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet and tosses them right into the fire with the heifer. 7. After that, the priest gotta wash his clothes, take a shower, then he can join the squad again, but he gonna be considered unclean until the evening. 8. And the person who burns her shall, like, clean their clothes with water and, like, wash their body with water, and they'll be like, um, unclean until the evening. 9. So, like, this dude who's pure, he's gotta collect the ashes of the cow and stash 'em outside the camp in a clean spot. It's gonna be saved for the whole Israelite crew as a way to purify themselves from sin, you know? It's like a special water that separates them from the bad stuff. 10. Whoever collects the ashes of the heifer gotta wash their clothes and stay unclean until evening. This rule goes for the peeps of Israel and even the strangers visiting them. It's gonna be a forever thing, yo. 11. Yo, if you come in contact with a dead body, you're gonna be unclean for a whole week. It's like a serious rule, ya know. Take note, fam! 🙅‍♂️💀 12. So, like, he's gotta use it to cleanse himself on the third day, and if he skips that, then he won't be clean by the seventh day. 13. If anyone touches a dead body and doesn't cleanse themselves, they make the sacred place unholy in the eyes of the LORD. And that person will be kicked out of Israel because they didn't get sprinkled with the special water to purify themselves. So they're still unclean and covered in their impurity. 14. Yo, listen up! Here's the deal: if someone kicks the bucket in a tent, everyone who goes in or stays inside the tent will be considered unclean for a whole week. 15. And any open container that doesn't have a lid on it is considered dirty. 16. If anyone touches a dead body, a bone, or a grave in the open fields, they will be considered unclean for a whole week. 17. And if someone is considered unclean, they should take some of the ashes from the burnt heifer used for purifying from sins, and add some fresh water to it in a container: the ashes are like dusty stuff and the water should be flowing and alive. 18. So, like, get someone who's got their act together and give them some hyssop. Then, they gotta dip it in water and sprinkle that stuff all over the tent, the things inside the tent, the people in the tent, and even anyone who came in contact with a bone, someone who was killed, a dead person, or a grave. 19. The hygienic person gotta sprinkle water on the not-so-hygienic person on the third day and the seventh day. On the seventh day, they gotta clean themselves up, wash their clothes, take a good bath, and be all fresh and clean by the evening. 20. But anyone who is unclean and doesn't cleanse themselves will be excluded from the community. They've made the LORD's sacred place impure and haven't been purified with the cleansing water. They're dirty. 21. This rule is super important: anyone who sprays the special water has to wash their clothes, and anyone who touches the water is gonna be unclean until nighttime. Like, it's a forever thing, man. 22. Like, anything the unclean person touches is gonna be unclean, and anyone who touches it is gonna be unclean until evening. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 191. And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 2. This {is} the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein {is} no blemish, {and} upon which never came yoke: 3. And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and {one} shall slay her before his face: 4. And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times: 5. And {one} shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: 6. And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast {it} into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 7. Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. 8. And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. 9. And a man {that is} clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay {them} up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it {is} a purification for sin. 10. And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. 11. He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days. {man: Heb. soul of man} 12. He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. 13. Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness {is} yet upon him. 14. This {is} the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that {is} in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. 15. And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, {is} unclean. 16. And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. 17. And for an unclean {person} they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: {ashes: Heb. dust} {running...: Heb. living waters shall be given} 18. And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip {it} in the water, and sprinkle {it} upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: 19. And the clean {person} shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even. 20. But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he {is} unclean. 21. And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even. 22. And whatsoever the unclean {person} toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth {it} shall be unclean until even. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 201. So, all the Israelites, like, the whole crew, went to the desert of Zin in the beginning of the year. They set up camp in Kadesh, and unfortunately, Miriam passed away and was laid to rest there. 2. So, like, there was, like, zero water for everyone, and they all got super mad at Moses and Aaron. 3. The people totally went off on Moses, saying like, 'Dude, we wish we had kicked the bucket like our homies before the LORD!' 4. Why did you have to drag us and all our animals out into this deserted place to die? 5. Why did you even bring us out of Egypt, just to bring us to this terrible place? There's no food, no figs, no vines, no pomegranates, and not even any water to drink! 6. So Moses and Aaron bounced out of the crowd and headed to the entrance of the tabernacle where everyone was meeting up. They totally dropped to the ground on their faces—mind blown when they saw the epic presence of the LORD. 7. Yo, the big man upstairs talked to Moses, like, 8. Yo, grab that rod and gather up the squad - you and your bro Aaron. Then, speak to the rock in front of everyone. And check it, the rock will straight up gush water, and you'll hook up the whole crew and their animals with a refreshing drink. 9. So Moses grabbed the rod like God told him to. 10. So Moses and Aaron got everyone to meet up by this big rock, right? Then Moses is like, 'Listen up, you rebels. Do we have to seriously get water from this rock for you?' 11. So, Moses raised his hand and, with his staff, struck the rock two times. And, like, a ton of water gushed out, and everyone in the crew drank, including their animals. Pretty epic, if you ask me. 12. So, like, God was talking to Moses and Aaron, and He was like, 'Yo, since you didn't have faith in Me and make Me holy in front of the Israelites, neither of you will be leading them to the land I promised.' 13. This is the story of the time the Israelites had a huge argument with God at Meribah, and He showed His holiness through it. (Just so you know, Meribah means 'strife'.) 14. So Moses DM'd some messengers to the king of Edom, and he was like, 'Yo, bro Israel here. You know all the craziness we've been through, right? Like, seriously, it's been a lot of drama.' 15. So yeah, our ancestors totally migrated to Egypt and like, we've been chillin' there for, like, ages. But those Egyptians were like, total jerks and gave us a hard time, along with our ancestors, man: 16. So, like, we were totally crying out to the LORD, and you won't believe it, but He actually heard us and sent an angel to rescue us from Egypt. And guess what?! Now we're chilling in Kadesh, which is this sick city right on the edge of our territory! 17. Hey, can we please pass through your turf? Don't worry, we won't wander off into the fields or vineyards, nor will we take a sip from the wells. We'll stick to the main road, no detours to the right or left, until we're out of your territory. 18. And Edom said to him, like, 'No way, dude! You better not try to come through here, 'cause I'll straight up come at you with my sword.' 19. Yo, the Israelites were like, 'We'll take the main road, fam. And if me and my animals need a sip of your water, don't worry, I'll pay up. I just want to pass through without causing any extra trouble, ya feel? 20. He was like, 'No way, you're not coming through.' But then, Edom straight up rolled up on him with a whole squad and some serious power. 21. So Edom straight up rejected giving Israel a detour through their turf, causing Israel to bounce and go another way. 22. So, like, all the Israelite peeps, including the whole squad, bounced from Kadesh and arrived at this lit place called Mount Hor. 23. Yo, the LORD straight up talked to Moses and Aaron on mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, like yo, He was saying, 24. Aaron's gonna join his crew, 'cause he ain't gonna step foot in the land I hooked up for the Israelites. Y'all straight up defied my word at the water of Meribah. Word up. 25. Yo, grab Aaron and his boy Eleazar and take them up to mount Hor, okay? 26. Take away Aaron's clothes and put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron will join his ancestors and die there. 27. So Moses did what the LORD said and they all went up to mount Hor with the entire crew watching. 28. So Moses took off Aaron's clothes and gave them to his son, Eleazar. Then Aaron died there on the top of the mountain. Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain together. 29. And when everyone in the crew saw that Aaron had passed away, they were all bummed out for a whole month. Yeah, all of Israel was feeling it. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 201. Then came the children of Israel, {even} the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. 2. And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. 3. And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD! 4. And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? 5. And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it {is} no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither {is} there any water to drink. 6. And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them. 7. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8. Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. 9. And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him. 10. And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock? 11. And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts {also}. 12. And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. 13. This {is} the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them. {Meribah: that is, Strife} 14. And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: {befallen...: Heb. found us} 15. How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers: 16. And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we {are} in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: 17. Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink {of} the water of the wells: we will go by the king's {high} way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders. 18. And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword. 19. And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without {doing} any thing {else}, go through on my feet. 20. And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. 21. Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him. 22. And the children of Israel, {even} the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. 23. And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying, 24. Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah. {word: Heb. mouth} 25. Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: 26. And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered {unto his people}, and shall die there. 27. And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 28. And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. 29. And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, {even} all the house of Israel. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 211. So, there was this Canaanite king named Arad living in the south. He got wind that the Israelites, who sent some spies in advance, were on their way. He decided to go all out and attack the Israelites, managing to capture a few of them as prisoners. 2. And Israel made a promise to the LORD, and was like, 'If you actually let me win against these people, I'll totally wipe out their cities.' 3. So, like, God totally listened to Israel and gave them the victory over the Canaanites. They straight up wiped them out, along with all their cities. And they named the place Hormah, which basically means total destruction.  4. So, they left mount Hor, and they took the route by the Red Sea to go around the land of Edom. And let me tell you, the people were really bummed out, like, super discouraged because of the long and tiring journey. 5. And the people were like, totally dissing God and Moses, asking them why they took us out of Egypt just to let us die in this boring desert? Like, we don't even have bread or water, and this plain bread is, like, totally grossing us out. 6. So, like, the LORD was not happy with the people, and He sent these super gnarly fiery serpents to bite them. It was intense, man. Sadly, a lot of the Israelites ended up dying from those snake bites. :( 7. So the people went up to Moses and were like, 'Alright, we messed up. We talked smack about the LORD, and even about you! Can you please hit up the LORD and ask Him to get rid of these snakes?'. And Moses was like, 'Sure thing,' and he prayed to the LORD for the people. 8. And God was like, yo Moses, make a snake that's all lit up and put it on a stick. And here's the deal: anyone who got bit by a snake, if they look at that snake on the stick, they won't die and they'll keep on livin'. 9. So Moses whipped up this sick bronze snake and stuck it on a pole. And you won't believe it, but if anyone got bit by a snake, all they had to do was look at that bronze snake and they were good to go, alive and kickin'. 10. So the Israelites moved on and set up camp in Oboth. 11. They moved on from Oboth and set up camp at Ijeabarim, in the desert before Moab, facing east towards the sunrise. (Ijeabarim means piles of Abarim.) 12. Then they moved on and set up camp in the Zared valley. 13. So they moved and set up camp across Arnon, which is in the wilderness on the outskirts of Amorite territory. Arnon marks the boundary between Moab and the Amorites, ya know? 14. So, like, in this ancient book called 'The Wars of the LORD,' it tells us all about the epic stuff He did at the Red Sea and the brooks of Arnon. It's like, whoa, can you even imagine the power and awesomeness displayed there? Game-changer, dude! #MindBlown 15. And at the river where the cool brooks flow, heading towards the chill vibes of Ar's spot, chilling right near the Moab's boundary. {leaneth: Basically rests, bro} 16. And then they went to Beer: that's the well where the LORD spoke to Moses and said, 'Get everyone together and I'll hook them up with some water.' 17. And Israel dropped this sick verse like, Yo, let that well flow; sing your heart out to it: {Flow up...: Hebrew. Ascend} {sing: or, respond} 18. The royal squad started digging the well, alongside the cool crew of the people, guided by the lawgiver, armed with their sticks. And they kept moving from the wilderness to Mattanah: 19. And like, from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and then from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 20. And from this dope place called Bamoth in the valley, which is in Moab, all the way to the lit top of Pisgah, where you can peep the sick view towards Jeshimon. (btw Jeshimon means wilderness) 21. So Israel hit up Sihon, the king of the Amorites, with a DM, like, 22. Yo, can we slide through your turf? We won't trespass on your crops or vineyards, or even sip your well water. We'll just stick to the main road, roll until we're out of your territory. 23. So, like, Sihon was, like, totally not cool with letting Israel enter his turf. But, instead, Sihon got all his peeps together and straight up confronted Israel out in the middle of nowhere. They rolled up to Jahaz and started a full-on battle with Israel. 24. And Israel totally defeated him with their swords and took over his land from Arnon to Jabbok, right up to the Ammonites' territory, 'cause the Ammonites were no joke when it came to defending their border. 25. So Israel conquered all of these cities and settled in the land of the Amorites, including Heshbon and all its surrounding towns. {towns: in Hebrew, daughters} 26. Yo, Heshbon used to be ruled by Sihon, the boss of the Amorites. He straight-up went head-to-head with the previous king of Moab and swooped in, taking all his land all the way to Arnon. No cap. 27. So, like, people who are all wise and stuff say, 'Hey, let's head to Heshbon and build up Sihon's city, you know, get it all ready and stuff.' 28. Yo, there's straight-up fire coming outta Heshbon, like a lit flame from the city of Sihon. It's totally wrecked Ar of Moab and the big shots chillin' at the high places of Arnon. 29. Dang, Moab! You're in deep trouble, peeps of Chemosh: their sons and daughters got captured by Sihon, the Amorite king. 30. We straight up wrecked them, like Heshbon got totally destroyed to Dibon, and we totally trashed them all the way to Nophah and Medeba. 31. So Israel was chilling in the Amorite's turf. 32. So Moses was like, 'Yo, let's check out Jaazer and see what's up.' And they totally took over the whole town, kicking out those Amorites who were chillin' there. 33. Then they took a detour through Bashan, and guess who showed up? Og, the king of Bashan, and his whole crew, ready to fight them at Edrei. 34. Yo, Moses, don't stress! I got your back. I'm handing this dude, his crew, and his turf over to you. Do to him what you did to that Sihon guy, the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon. 35. So they totally wrecked him, his sons, and all his squad, until there was literally no one left alive. And then they straight up took over his land. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 211. And {when} king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took {some} of them prisoners. 2. And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities. 3. And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah. {Hormah: that is, Utter destruction} 4. And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. {discouraged: or, grieved: Heb. shortened} 5. And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for {there is} no bread, neither {is there any} water; and our soul loatheth this light bread. 6. And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died. 7. Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. 8. And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. 9. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. 10. And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. 11. And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which {is} before Moab, toward the sunrising. {Ijeabarim: or, heaps of Abarim} 12. From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. 13. From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which {is} in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon {is} the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 14. Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, {What...: or, Vaheb in Suphah} 15. And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab. {lieth: Heb. leaneth} 16. And from thence {they went} to Beer: that {is} the well whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water. 17. Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it: {Spring...: Heb. Ascend} {sing: or, answer} 18. The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by {the direction of} the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness {they went} to Mattanah: 19. And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 20. And from Bamoth {in} the valley, that {is} in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon. {country: Heb. field} {Pisgah: or, the hill} {Jeshimon: or, the wilderness} 21. And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 22. Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink {of} the waters of the well: {but} we will go along by the king's {high} way, until we be past thy borders. 23. And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 24. And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon {was} strong. 25. And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof. {villages: Heb. daughters} 26. For Heshbon {was} the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon. 27. Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: 28. For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, {and} the lords of the high places of Arnon. 29. Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites. 30. We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which {reacheth} unto Medeba. 31. Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 32. And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that {were} there. 33. And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei. 34. And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 35. So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 221. So the Israelites moved on and camped in the chill plains of Moab across the Jordan river, near Jericho.  2. So, like, Balak, this dude who is Zippor's son, he totally witnessed all the epic stuff that Israel pulled off against the Amorites, ya know. 3. Moab was freaking out, man, because the Israelites were like a huge crowd! It was giving them major anxiety and stress! 4. So Moab goes to the older peeps of Midian and is like, 'Dude, these guys are gonna totally obliterate everything around us, just like when an ox chows down on grass in the field.' And Balak, Zippor's son, was rockin' the crown as the king of the Moabites back then. 5. So, he like totally hit up some messengers to get in touch with Balaam, you know, Beor's kid from Pethor, which BTW is by the river where his homies live. He wanted Balaam to come over 'cause he noticed this huge crowd of peeps who dipped from Egypt, and they're legit everywhere, like flooding the whole place. And they're camped right across from me, like right in my backyard! 😮 6. Yo, hear me out, could you do me a solid and put a curse on these people? They're way too strong for me to handle. Maybe if we take them out, I'll have a chance at kicking them out of the land. I know that whoever you bless ends up blessed, and whoever you curse is, well, cursed. 7. So, like, the old guys from Moab and Midian, right? They went off with their divination stuff in hand, and they found Balaam, and started talking to him, delivering the message from Balak. 8. So he was like, 'Stay here for the night, and I’ll hit you up with the message that the LORD gives me.' And the Moabite leaders chilled out with Balaam. 9. And God approached Balaam and asked, Who are these dudes chillin' with you? 10. So like Balaam was talking to God and he was all like, 'Dude, Balak, son of Zippor, the Moab king, sent me this message...' 11. Yo, check it out, there's this nation that straight up left Egypt and they're everywhere, bro. You feel me? Anyway, try putting a curse on them and maybe I'll have a shot at beating them and kicking them out. Who knows, maybe I'll have the upper hand in this fight! 12. And God was like, 'Balaam, sorry buddy, you can't roll with them. You gotta keep those curses to yourself because these people, they're totally blessed, ya know'. 13. So, like, Balaam woke up in the morning and he was all like, 'Hey, Balak's peeps, head back to your own turf because God's like, not giving me the green light to roll with y'all.' 14. So the Moabite leaders decided to approach Balak and told him, 'Balaam won't roll with us, dude.' 15. So Balak decided to send even more important and respected princes this time. 16. So, like, Balak, Zippor's son, went to Balaam and was all like, 'Dude, nothing should, like, stop you from coming to me, okay? Don't let anything get in your way.' 17. Yo, I'm about to hook you up with some major respect and do whatever you ask of me. So, do me a solid and drop a curse on these folks, please! 18. And Balaam was like, yo, Balak's peeps, listen up. Even if Balak offered me a whole crib filled with mad stacks of cash and bling, I can't stray from what the LORD my God has said. I gotta stay true and not do anything more or less. 19. Hey guys, listen up! Can y'all just chill here with me tonight? I really wanna find out what God's gonna tell me next, you know? 20. So, like, God showed up to Balaam in the middle of the night and was all like, 'Hey dude, if these guys come to get you, get up and go with them. But, just FYI, you gotta do exactly what I tell you when I say it.' 21. So Balaam woke up bright and early, hopped on his ride, and rolled with the Moab crew. 22. And God was like, really upset because he went that way: and this angel from the LORD showed up as like, a total obstacle to stop him. And he was just riding on his donkey, with his two friends riding along too. 23. And the donkey saw the angel of the LORD blocking the path, with their sword drawn: and the donkey quickly veered off the road and ran into the field. So, Balaam hit the donkey to get her back on track. 24. But like, this angel, right? They were standing in the middle of a vineyard, with walls on both sides. Pretty epic, tbh. 25. And like, when the donkey spotted the LORD's angel, she totally freaked out and jammed herself against the wall, accidentally squishing Balaam's foot. And he, like, hit her in response. 26. Then the angel of the LORD went on and positioned himself in a super tight spot, where there was literally no way to escape or turn in any direction. 27. And when the donkey peeped the angel of the LORD, she totally tripped under Balaam: and Balaam got crazy mad, and he hit the donkey with a stick. 28. So, like, the LORD, right, makes the donkey talk, and she's like, 'Hey Balaam, what's up with hitting me three times? What did I do to deserve that?' 29. And Balaam was like, 'Dude, seriously? You're totally making fun of me right now? Ugh, if only I had a sword, I'd totally want to smack you with it.' 30. And the donkey was like, 'Dude, I've been your ride-or-die donkey since forever. Have I ever done you wrong like this before?' And Balaam was like, 'Nah, man.' 31. So, like, God suddenly made Balaam see this angel dude, just standing there with a sword in hand. And Balaam totally freaked out, man! He immediately bowed down his head and fell flat on his face. It was intense, bro! 32. Then the angel of the LORD was like, 'Dude, why did you hit your donkey three times? I came here to stop you because your path is totally messed up, you know, in a bad way.' 33. And the donkey saw me and avoided me three times. If she hadn't avoided me, I would have definitely killed you but spared her. 34. Balaam admitted to the angel of the LORD, 'I messed up, I had no idea you were standing in my way. If it bothers you, I'll turn back.' 35. And the angel of the LORD was like, 'Yo, Balaam, roll with the squad, but only say what I tell you to say.' So Balaam was down to hang with Balak's peeps. 36. And when Balak found out that Balaam had arrived, he went to meet him in a city of Moab, near the border of Arnon, which is in the farthest region. 37. Yo, Balak was like, 'Bro, didn't I like, seriously hit you up and ask you to come through? Why didn't you show up? I totally have the power to hook you up with mad respect and success, am I right? 38. And Balaam was like, 'Hey Balak, I'm here now. Can I even say anything on my own? I'm just gonna speak the words that God puts in my mouth, you know.' 39. So Balaam and Balak rolled up to Kirjathhuzoth. You know, the city with all those lit streets. 40. So Balak flexed with some lit oxen and sheep, and hit up Balaam and his squad of princes. 41. The next day, Balak brought Balaam to the top places where Baal was worshipped, so that he could get a view of the whole crowd. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 221. And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan {by} Jericho. 2. And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 3. And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they {were} many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. 4. And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all {that are} round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor {was} king of the Moabites at that time. 5. He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which {is} by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: {face: Heb. eye} 6. Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they {are} too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, {that} we may smite them, and {that} I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest {is} blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. 7. And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. 8. And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. 9. And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men {are} these with thee? 10. And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, {saying}, 11. Behold, {there is} a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out. {I shall...: Heb. I shall prevail in fighting against him} 12. And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they {are} blessed. 13. And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you. 14. And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. 15. And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. 16. And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: {Let...: Heb. Be not thou hindered from, etc} 17. For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people. 18. And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more. 19. Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more. 20. And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, {and} go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do. 21. And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. 22. And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants {were} with him. 23. And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. 24. But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall {being} on this side, and a wall on that side. 25. And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again. 26. And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where {was} no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 27. And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff. 28. And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? 29. And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee. 30. And the ass said unto Balaam, {Am} not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since {I was} thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay. {upon...: Heb. who hast ridden upon me} {ever since...: or, ever since thou wast, etc} 31. Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face. {fell...: or, bowed himself} 32. And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because {thy} way is perverse before me: {to...: Heb. to be an adversary unto thee} 33. And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive. 34. And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. {displease...: Heb. be evil in thine eyes} 35. And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 36. And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which {is} in the border of Arnon, which {is} in the utmost coast. 37. And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour? 38. And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. 39. And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth. {Kirjathhuzoth: or, a city of streets} 40. And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that {were} with him. 41. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost {part} of the people. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 231. So Balaam was like, 'Yo Balak, I need you to set up seven altars for me right here, and bring me seven oxen and seven rams.' 2. So Balak did exactly what Balaam said, and both Balak and Balaam sacrificed a bull and a ram on each altar. 3. And Balaam was like, 'Yo Balak, hold up and do your burnt offering thing while I go up to this dope spot. Maybe God will come chill with me and show me some crazy stuff. And whatever He shows me, I'll come back and tell you all about it.' So, Balaam went up to a high place. 4. So, like, God bumps into Balaam and is all like, 'Yo dude, I've set up seven altars and sacrificed a bullock and a ram on each one.' 5. And God gave Balaam a message to deliver to Balak, saying, 'Go back to Balak and speak these words.' 6. Then he came back to him, and, behold, he found him standing next to his burnt offering, along with all the cool peeps from Moab. 7. So, he starts spewing his wisdom and says, you won't believe it, but this dude Balak, the Moab king, dragged me all the way from Aram, which is in the mountains out east. He straight up told me, 'Yo, go ahead and put a curse on Jacob and throw some serious shade at Israel.' 8. Like, why would I even think about cursing someone that God hasn't cursed, or like, defying someone that the LORD hasn't defied? 9. I spot him from the highest rocks and hills, you know? The people gonna live on their own, not getting counted with the other nations. 10. OMG, have you ever tried counting all the particles of dust on TikTok? It's like impossible! And don't even get me started on the huge number of influencers in Israel! Honestly, I low-key wish I could live my life like the righteous peeps and have a totally lit ending, just like them. #Goals 11. And Balak was like, bruh, what did you just do to me? I brought you here to totally curse my enemies, and now you've straight up blessed them instead. Like, what's the deal?! 12. And he's like, yo, should I not be careful about speaking the words that the LORD has placed in my mouth? 13. So Balak was like, 'Hey, come along with me to this other spot where you can kinda see them from afar. You won't be able to see the whole crew, just a glimpse. And then, hit 'em up with a sick curse from there, ya know!' 14. So he took him to the cool spot called Zophim, up on the Pisgah hill. And there, he set up seven altars and sacrificed a bull and a ram on each one. (By the way, Pisgah is just another name for the hill.) 15. And he was like, yo Balak, just stay here by your burnt offering, while I go up and meet with the LORD over there. 16. So like, God came across Balaam and gave him a message, saying, 'Go back to Balak and tell him this, dude.' 17. So, when he got there, he saw the dude next to his burnt offering and the Moab VIPs were there too. Balak was like, 'Yo, what did God say?' 18. Yo, listen up Balak, I got a story to tell. Pay attention, Zippor's child. 19. God isn't like a person who lies or changes his mind. If he says something, he'll definitely do it. If he speaks, he'll definitely make it happen. 20. Yo, listen up! I just got this super cool command to bless someone, and guess what? They've been blessed, and I can't just undo it, like, impossible! 21. God hasn't seen any wrongdoing in Jacob, and in Israel, there's no wickedness. The LORD, their God, is with them, and they've got the king's support booming through their ranks. 22. God totally saved them from Egypt; he's like as powerful as a unicorn. 23. Ugh, like no magic can touch Jacob, and no one can predict what's gonna happen to Israel. People are gonna be like, 'OMG, look at what God did for Jacob and Israel!' 24. Yo, check it out, the people gonna be like a boss lion, flexin' like a young lion. They won't chill until they feast on that prey and sip the blood of the defeated. 25. Balak was like, dude, don't even curse them, or bless them. 26. Yo, Balak! Didn't I already tell you that whatever the LORD says, I gotta do? Balaam out! 27. So Balak was like, 'Hey, Balaam, come with me to a different spot. Maybe if we're there, God will be cool with you cursing this group for me.' 28. And Balak took Balaam to the peak of Peor, with a view towards Jeshimon. 29. So Balaam was like, 'Hey Balak, let's flex with seven altars up in here! And don't forget to bring seven bullocks and seven rams, all set and ready!' 30. So Balak listened to Balaam and sacrificed a bullock and a ram on every single altar. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 231. And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams. 2. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on {every} altar a bullock and a ram. 3. And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place. {to an...: or, solitary} 4. And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon {every} altar a bullock and a ram. 5. And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak. 6. And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab. 7. And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, {saying}, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. 8. How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, {whom} the LORD hath not defied? 9. For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations. 10. Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth {part} of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his! {me: Heb. my soul, or, my life} 11. And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed {them} altogether. 12. And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD hath put in my mouth? 13. And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence. 14. And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on {every} altar. {Pisgah: or, the hill} 15. And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet {the LORD} yonder. 16. And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus. 17. And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken? 18. And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: 19. God {is} not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do {it}? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good? 20. Behold, I have received {commandment} to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it. 21. He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God {is} with him, and the shout of a king {is} among them. 22. God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn. 23. Surely {there is} no enchantment against Jacob, neither {is there} any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! {against: or, in} 24. Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat {of} the prey, and drink the blood of the slain. 25. And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all. 26. But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do? 27. And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence. 28. And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward Jeshimon. 29. And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams. 30. And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on {every} altar. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 241. And when Balaam peeped that the LORD was down with blessing Israel, he didn't even bother trying to do his usual tricks and magic. Instead, he started heading straight for the wilderness. {to the meeting of: in other words, towards God} 2. So, Balaam looked up and saw Israel chillin' in their tents, organized by their tribes. And then, the Spirit of God popped off and entered him.  3. So this guy named Balaam, son of Beor, had something to say. He was enlightened, enlightened enough to say this: 'yo, I used to be blind but now I see, and this is what I gotta share:' 4. Yo, this dude heard God speak and had a vision from the Almighty. He was in a crazy trance, but his eyes were wide open, man! 5. Dude, check out how awesome Jacob's tents are, and Israel's tabernacles are seriously rad! 6. They're like those cool valleys, spreading out like lit gardens next to the river, planted by the LORD like trendy aloes and cedar trees chilling out by the waters. 7. He's gonna flex with his buckets of water, and his squad will be everywhere, and his king will be totally superior to Agag, and his kingdom is gonna be like, totally on another level. 8. God totally flexed on those haters by bringing him out of Egypt. Like, he's got the strength of a mythical unicorn and he's gonna totally demolish every nation that stands against him. He'll crush their bones and shoot them full of arrows, no mercy. 9. He totally went beast mode, chillin' and layin' down like a lion, a legit king of the jungle. Don't even think about tryna mess with him, 'cause you'll be cursed, but if you bless him, you're blessed AF. 10. Balak was so mad at Balaam, he clapped his hands together and straight up told him, 'Dude, I brought you here to curse my enemies, and now you've only been blessing them for the third time! Like, seriously?'} 11. So like, you need to bounce and go back to where you came from: I totally wanted to hook you up with major clout, but dang, God decided to hold you back from the VIP status. 12. Balaam was like, 'Yo Balak, didn't I already tell your peeps you sent my way, like,' 13. Yo, even if Balak hooked me up with a sick crib filled with stacks of cash, I can't go against what the Big Man upstairs says. I ain't got no say in doing good or bad on my own terms. I'm just gonna speak what the LORD tells me, no cap. 14. Yo, listen up! I'm about to bounce back to my peeps. So come through and I'll let you in on what's gonna go down between your people and mine in the future. 15. So, like, check it out. This dude Balaam, son of Beor, got some wise words to drop. He's like, this guy's eyes are wide open, and he got something to say: 16. Yo, listen up! This dude heard God's words and had mad knowledge about the Most High. He even saw a vision from the Almighty while in a deep state, but with his eyes wide open. 17. I'll catch a glimpse of him, but not yet: I'll see him from afar, but not up close. A rad Star will emerge from Jacob, and a sovereign ruler will rise from Israel, striking the corners of Moab and taking down all the descendants of Sheth. {strike...: or, strike through the leaders of} 18. And Edom will totally be owned, Seir will also be owned by their haters; and Israel will totally slay. 19. The one who's gonna be in charge, coming straight outta Jacob, is gonna wreck the remaining peeps in the city. 20. So, like, when he saw Amalek, he started speaking his mind and was like, 'Dude, Amalek used to think they were the top nation, but trust me, they're gonna bite the dust and go down for good.' (Just to clarify, he's talking about the nations that messed with Israel.) 21. Yo, he peeped the Kenites and dropped some knowledge, saying, 'You're living it up in a solid crib, nesting in a rock.' 22. But the Kenite tribe will face destruction, until Asshur takes you captive. (Kenite means Kain, btw.) How much longer until Asshur captures you? 23. And he dropped some truth and was like, dang, who's gonna survive when God does His thing! 24. And like, there will be these sick ships coming from the coast of Chittim, right? And they'll totally mess with Asshur and Eber, dude. Like, they'll seriously mess them up forever, man! 25. So Balaam bounced and headed back home, while Balak took off too. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 241. And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. {to seek...: Heb. to the meeting of} 2. And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding {in his tents} according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him. 3. And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: {whose...: Heb. who had his eyes shut, but now opened} 4. He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling {into a trance}, but having his eyes open: 5. How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, {and} thy tabernacles, O Israel! 6. As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, {and} as cedar trees beside the waters. 7. He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed {shall be} in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted. 8. God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce {them} through with his arrows. 9. He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir him up? Blessed {is} he that blesseth thee, and cursed {is} he that curseth thee. 10. And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed {them} these three times. 11. Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour. 12. And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me, saying, 13. If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do {either} good or bad of mine own mind; {but} what the LORD saith, that will I speak? 14. And now, behold, I go unto my people: come {therefore, and} I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days. 15. And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 16. He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most High, {which} saw the vision of the Almighty, falling {into a trance}, but having his eyes open: 17. I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. {smite...: or, smite through the princes of} 18. And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly. 19. Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city. 20. And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek {was} the first of the nations; but his latter end {shall be} that he perish for ever. {the nations: the nations that warred against Israel} {that...: or, even to destruction} 21. And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock. 22. Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive. {the Kenite: Heb. Kain} {until...: or, how long shall it be ere Asshur carry thee away captive} 23. And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this! 24. And ships {shall come} from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever. 25. And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 251. So Israel set up camp in Shittim, and the people started getting involved with the Moabite girls, you know... 2. So, like, they invited everyone to, like, this big worship gathering for their gods, and all the people totally ate the sacrificial food and, like, totally worshipped their gods by bowing down. It was, like, a whole thing. 3. So Israel started vibing with Baalpeor, and God got real mad at them. 4. Yo, God was like, Mosess, gather up all the top dudes in the nation and set them up as a display before me, like right under the sun. Let's chill out my anger and protect Israel.' 5. So Moses told the judges of Israel to take down every single one of their guys who were getting involved with Baalpeor. 6. So listen up, this Israelite dude showed up with a Midianite girl right in front of Moses and all the people. And guess what? Everyone was crying their hearts out by the entrance of the sacred tent where they all gathered. 7. And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, peeped it, he straight up got up from the squad and grabbed a javelin, no cap; 8. Then he followed the guy from Israel into the tent, and stabbed both of them. Yes, he struck the guy from Israel and pierced the woman's belly. As a result, the plague stopped spreading among the children of Israel. 9. So like, twenty-four thousand peeps totally bit the dust from that wicked plague. 10. Yo, God had a chat with Moses, like, 11. Yo, this dude Phinehas, he's the son of Eleazar, who's the son of Aaron the priest, managed to calm me down when I was all angry at the Israelite peeps. He was super passionate about representing me, which saved the Israelite children from getting wiped out. I was usin' my jealousy to make a point but Phinehas shut that down real quick. #TeamPhinehas 12. So, like, I'm telling you, yo, check it out! I'm totally sliding my covenant of peace his way, you feel me? 13. And he's gonna get it, and his descendants too, the covenant for an everlasting priesthood, all because he was so hyped for his God and made things right for the children of Israel. 14. So, basically, there was this guy named Zimri, an Israelite. He got involved with this Midianite woman and, sadly, ended up getting killed. Zimri was actually the son of Salu, a high-ranking leader from one of the important families of the Simeonites. You know, like a big deal. 15. And the Midianitish chick that got killed was named Cozbi, the daughter of Zur. He was like the boss of a crew, the leader of a lit fam in Midian. 16. God slid into Moses' DMs like, 'Yo, listen up!' 17. Mess with those Midianites, and totally crush them: 18. They really messed with you using their tricks, they completely fooled you in the situation with Peor and Cozbi, who was a super important Midianite leader's daughter and also their sister. She got killed during the plague that happened because of what went down at Peor. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 251. And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab. 2. And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. 3. And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel. 4. And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel. 5. And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor. 6. And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who {were} weeping {before} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 7. And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw {it}, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand; 8. And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 9. And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand. 10. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 11. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy. {for...: Heb. with my zeal} 12. Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: 13. And he shall have it, and his seed after him, {even} the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel. 14. Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, {even} that was slain with the Midianitish woman, {was} Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites. {chief...: Heb. house of a father} 15. And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain {was} Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he {was} head over a people, {and} of a chief house in Midian. 16. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17. Vex the Midianites, and smite them: 18. For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 261. And like, after the whole plague thing, God was like, yo Moses and Eleazar (ya know, Aaron's son who's a priest), I got something to say. 2. Count all the peeps in the fam of the Israelites, starting from age 20 and up, from every fam's crib, everyone ready to throw down in battle for Israel. 3. So, Moses and Eleazar the priest were like talking to them in the chill plains of Moab by the Jordan River, you know, close to Jericho, and they were all like, 4. Count all the people who are twenty years old or older, just like the LORD told Moses and the Israelites when they left Egypt. 5. Reuben, the OG child of Israel: Reuben's fam be rockin' with Hanoch, who's the ancestor of the Hanochites, and Pallu, the founder of the Palluite squad: 6. The fam of Hezron, specifically the Hezronites, were descended from Hezron. And the fam of Carmi, they were the Carmites, you know! 7. These are the squads of the Reubenites: and the total count of them was forty-three thousand and seven hundred and thirty. 8. And Pallu had a son called Eliab. 9. And Eliab had two sons, Nemuel and Dathan, and Abiram. So, this is the same Dathan and Abiram who became pretty well-known in the community because they constantly opposed Moses and Aaron when they teamed up with Korah to challenge the authority of the LORD. 10. LOL, like, the earth was like, 'OMG, open sesame!' and boop, it gobbled them up along with Korah and the rest of the peeps who bit the dust when a fiery blast consumed 250 dudes. TBH, it totally became a sign and stuff. 11. But yo, the kids of Korah didn't even die though. 12. The fam squads of Simeon's boys: Nemuel and his crew, Jamin and his posse, Jachin and his squad. BTW, Nemuel is known as Jemuel and Jachin goes by Jarib too. 13. The Zarhites were from the Zerah fam, and the Shaulites were from the Shaul fam. (Zerah was also known as Zohar) 14. These are the squads of the Simeonites, totaling 22,200 fellas. 15. Yo, here are the squad names of the children of Gad and their fams: Zephon's fam reppin' the Zephonites, Haggi's fam rockin' the Haggites, Shuni's fam holdin' it down for the Shunites. Oh, and BTW, Zephon is also known as Ziphion, just a little name switch-up, ya know? 16. The Ozni crew, straight up Oznites fam. And don't forget about Eri's squad, the Erites. Oh, by the way, Ozni goes by Ezbon too, just so you know. 17. Like, for Arod, it's all about the Arodites fam, and for Areli, it's all about the Arelites fam. Oh, just so you know, Arod is also known as Arodi. 18. These are the squads of the peeps from Team Gad, yo. We counted 'em and they came up to a tight 40,500 members. 19. Judah had two sons, Er and Onan, but sadly they passed away while they were in Canaan. 20. So, the fams of Judah were like: The Shelanites were descendants of Shelah, the Pharzites were descendants of Pharez, and the Zarhites were descendants of Zerah. 21. Yo, Pharez had some sons too. Hezron had his own crew called the Hezronites, and Hamul had his peeps called the Hamulites. 22. Yo, these be the fams of Judah, like the peeps that got counted were 76.5K in total. 23. This is the breakdown of the families of Issachar: Tola's family is known as the Tolaites, while Pua's family is known as the Punites (also called Phuvah). 24. The Jashub fam represents the Jashubites, the Shimron fam reps the Shimronites. (Jashub might be Job, idk) 25. So, like, these are the different fams of Issachar, you know, according to the total number of peeps in each fam. And, like, there were like 64,300 members. Pretty huge, right? 26. The Zebulun fam got these subgroups: the Sardites which are from Sered, the Elonites which are from Elon, and the Jahleelites which are from Jahleel. 27. These are the Zebulun fams, yo. They totalled up to 67.5K peeps. 28. Joseph had two sons named Manasseh and Ephraim, each with their own family. 29. So, like, Manasseh had a son named Machir, and Machir's fam was known as the Machirites. And guess what? Machir was a proud dad and had a son named Gilead, and Gilead's fam was called the Gileadites, duh! 30. These dudes were Gilead's sons: Jeezer and his crew, known as the Jeezerites; Helek and his posse, known as the Helekites. Oh, and by the way, Jeezer was also called Abiezer. 31. And as for Asriel, they were like one big fam known as the Asrielites. And same goes for Shechem, they were reppin' hard as the Shechemites fam: 32. And there were Shemidaites who came from Shemida, and Hepherites who came from Hepher. 33. So like, Zelophehad, Hepher's kid, didn't have any boys, just girls. And the names of the girls were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 34. These are the squads of Manasseh, and the total count of peeps was like fifty-two grand and seven hundo. 35. These are the squad of Ephraim sorted by their cliques: Shuthelah's crew rolls with the Shuthalhites, Becher's squad reps the Bachrites, and Tahan's posse represents the Tahanites. (Becher, aka Bered, is also part of the crew.) 36. And these are the kids of Shuthelah: Eran's crew, the Eranites. 37. So, like, these are the different families of the guys from Ephraim, ya know? There were like, 32,500 of them. And these are the sons of Joseph, chillin' with their own families and stuff. 38. Here are the fams of the Benjamin fam: Bela's fam is called the Belaites, Ashbel's fam is called the Ashbelites, and Ahiram's fam is called the Ahiramites. Oh, and BTW, Ahiram is also known as Ehi or Aharah. 39. The Shupham crew, the fam of the Shuphamites: the Hupham squad, the fam of the Huphamites. {Shupham...Hupham: AKA Muppim and Huppim} 40. So, Bela's kids were Ard and Naaman. Ard had a fam called the Ardites, and Naaman had a fam called the Naamites. Oh, and Ard was sometimes called Addar, FYI. 41. Here's the fam of Benjamin and the headcount was 45.6K sons. 42. Here are the fams of Dan: Shuham's crew, aka the Shuhamites. That's what Dan's fams are all about. Shuham's also known as Hushim. 43. So, like, the total number of Shuhamite families, you know, was like, 64,400. No cap. 44. Here's the deal - the Asher crew, they were all about their families. We had the Jimnites, the Jesuites, and the Beriites. They were tight-knit for sure. 45. Among Beriah's sons: Heber was the founder of the Heberites, and Malchiel was the forefather of the Malchielites. 46. And this girl from the squad of Asher was called Sarah. 47. These are the squads of the Asher squad fam according to the head count – 53.4k strong. 48. These are the clans of Naphtali: the Jahzeelites and the Gunites. 49. Jezer was the OG of the Jezer crew, and his squad was known as the Jezerites. Shillem, who was also called Shallum, was the leader of the Shillemites fam.  50. So, here's the deal: These are the fams of Naphtali, all sorted out and stuff. And get this, there was a total of 45.4K of them peeps when they got counted. Pretty legit, right? 51. This is how many kids there were in Israel: 600K plus 1.7K. 52. God talked to Moses, like, 53. So like, the land will be split among them for keepsies, based on their number of names and stuff. 54. You gotta distribute more inheritance to a larger number of peeps, and give less inheritance to a smaller group: everyone gets their fair share based on the numbers. {multiply his inheritance: in Hebrew it means increase his inheritance} {diminish his inheritance: in Hebrew it means decrease his inheritance} 55. But yo, the land gonna get split up by lottery, you know? Each tribe gonna score their inheritance based on their dad's lineage and all that. 56. The possession will be split between lots of people and just a few, based on the luck of the draw. 57. These are the Levites, divided into their respective families: the Gershonites, the Kohathites, and the Merarites. 58. These are the squads of the Levites: the Libnites crew, the Hebronites crew, the Mahlites squad, the Mushites squad, the Korathites squad. And Kohath had Amram. 59. Amram's wife was named Jochebed. She was the daughter of Levi, and she was born in Egypt. Jochebed gave birth to Aaron, Moses, and Miriam, their sister. 60. And Aaron had four kids named Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 61. Nadab and Abihu totally bit the dust after they tried to pull off some sketchy fire moves in front of the LORD. 62. And the total number of them was twenty-three thousand, all males from one month old and older. They weren't included in the count of the children of Israel because they didn't receive any inheritance among them. 63. So like, Moses and Eleazar the priest were all on top of their game, counting all the cool kids of Israel on the chill plains of Moab by the Jordan river, right next to Jericho. 64. But none of these guys were counted by Moses and Aaron the priest, when they did a headcount of the kids of Israel in the desert of Sinai. 65. Because the LORD had said that they would totally bite the dust in the desert. And, FYI, not a single one of them made it out alive, except for Caleb, Jephunneh's offspring, and Joshua, who's the son of Nun. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 261. And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 2.

And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by Jordan {near} Jericho, saying, 4. {Take the sum of the people}, from twenty years old and upward; as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt. 5.

      "Gen Z: Numbers 271. Yo, listen up! So there were these dope girls, the daughters of Zelophehad, who's son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the fam of Manasseh, son of Joseph. And check out their names: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They're pretty rad, huh? 2. So they all gathered around Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders in front of the tent, and spoke up, 3. Our dad passed away while we were trekking through the wild, and he wasn't part of the rebellious crew who opposed the LORD along with Korah. However, he ended up dying because of his own mistakes, and he didn't have any sons to continue his legacy. 4. Why should our father's name be lost just because he doesn't have a son? We want our fair share of our father's inheritance, like our brothers. Help us out! 5. And Moses brought their problem before the LORD. 6. So, like, God started talking to Moses, and He was like, 7. The girls of Zelophehad are totally right: you gotta hook them up with their rightful share of their dad's inheritance, just like you would for any other dudes in the fam. Make sure their dad's property gets passed down to them, no doubt. 8. Yo, tell the Israelites this: if a dude kicks the bucket and doesn't have a son, his daughter should inherit the goods. 9. And if he doesn't have a daughter, then his bros will get his inheritance. 10. And if he doesn't have any siblings, then you should give his inheritance to his father's siblings. 11. And if his dad doesn't have any uncles, then you should give his inheritance to his relative who is closest to him in the family, and he'll totally own it. And this rule is super important for the Israelites to follow, 'cause the Big Man Upstairs, aka the LORD, told Moses it's the way to go. 12. Yo, Moses! Head up to Mount Abarim and peep the land that I've hooked up for the Israelite squad. 13. And once you've seen it, you'll also be reunited with your crew, just like how Aaron, your bro, was reunited. 14. You totally went against what I told you to do back in the desert of Zin when everyone was arguing, and I wanted to show off my holiness by miraculously providing water for you to drink. Yeah, that's the same water that caused all that drama at Meribah in Kadesh, right there in the middle of the wilderness of Zin. 15. So Moses was like, talking to God and he was like, 16. Yo, let the LORD, the ultimate God of everyone's souls and bodies, appoint a dude to lead the whole assembly. 17. The one who goes ahead, the one who comes alongside, the one who guides, and the one who brings them to their destination; so that the crew of the LORD won't be lost like aimless sheep. 18. Yo, Moses, listen up. God told him to choose Joshua, son of Nun. This guy's got mad spirit and potential. So, Moses, put your hand on him, like, passing on the power. 19. Show him to Eleazar the priest and everyone else; give him a task right in front of them all. 20. And you gonna give him a lil' bit of your swag, so that all the squad of the Israelite crew will know who's boss and stay obedient. 21. And he's gotta be there in front of Eleazar the priest, who's like gonna think hard and make decisions on behalf of him using the Urim, asking God what to do. They're gonna follow his instructions, going in and out, both him and all the kids of Israel, like the whole crew. 22. So, Moses, like, totally followed God's instructions: he grabbed Joshua and brought him in front of Eleazar the priest and the whole crew. 23.

Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these {are} the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. 2. And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, {by} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, 3. Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons. 4. Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us {therefore} a possession among the brethren of our father. {done...: Heb. diminished} 5. And Moses brought their cause before the LORD. 6. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 7. The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. 8. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. 9. And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. 10. And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren. 11. And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses. 12. And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. 13. And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered. 14. For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that {is} the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. 15. And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, 16. Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, 17. Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd. 18. And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom {is} the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him; 19. And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight. 20. And thou shalt put {some} of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. 21. And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask {counsel} for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, {both} he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation. 22. And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation: 23. And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 281. Yo, God talked to Moses and He was like, 2. Tell the Israelites to give me their offerings and bread for my sacrifices. They should offer them to me at the right time, and it'll be a delightful offering that pleases me. It's like a chill scent for me to relax. 3. Yo, listen up! So, here's the deal: when it comes to offering fire sacrifices to the Lord, you gotta bring in two fresh lambs every single day. And these lambs gotta be in their prime, yo, no blemishes or defects. This ain't no one-time thing, it's a non-stop burnt offering, happening day after day. Gotta keep the fire burnin', if you catch my drift. Oh, and just to clarify, that dayy by day' part means it's gotta happen within a 24-hour period. Don't forget that, fam! 4. You gotta sacrifice one lamb in the morning, and another lamb in the evening. Yeah, that's right! Don't forget, 'evening' means 'between the two evenings' - just so you know, fam! 5. And like, you gotta use one-tenth of an ephah of flour for the offering, and mix it with like, a fourth of a hin of beaten oil. 6. It's like a consistent fully lit offering, set up back in Mount Sinai to give off a dope fragrance, a lit sacrifice made by fire for the LORD. 7. And for each lamb, pour a quarter of a hin of strong wine as a drink offering to the LORD in the sacred place. 8. And you gotta offer up the other lamb in the evening, just like you did in the morning, with that meat and drink offering as a lit sacrifice, pleasing unto the LORD. 9. On the Sabbath Day, you gotta bring two adorable lambs that are just one year old and perfect. Also, don't forget to bring two portions of flour mixed with oil as a food offering and its accompanying drink offering. 10. This here is the lit offering for every chill sabbath, in addition to the constant offering and the sick drink offering. 11. And for the start of each month, you gotta make a sick offering to the LORD: two young bullocks, one ram, and seven flawless one-year-old lambs. 12. And like, you gotta have, like, three big bags of flour for the offering, mixed with oil, for one bullock; and two big bags of flour for the offering, mixed with oil, for one ram, you know? 13. And about ten percent of flour mixed with oil, as a food offering for one lamb, as a burnt offering with a pleasing scent, a sacrifice made by fire for the LORD. 14. For their drink offerings, they shall offer half a hin of wine for a bullock, one-third of a hin for a ram, and one-fourth of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering that must be made every month, throughout the entire year. 15. And, like, one goat, for real, for a sin offering to God, will totally be offered, in addition to the regular burnt offering, and it's drink offering too. 16. On April 14th, it's time to get turnt with the Lord for Passover. 17. Yo, on the fifteenth day of this month, we gonna celebrate big time, fam. For a whole seven days, we gotta chow down on that unleavened bread, no joke. 18. On the first day, it's a chill gathering, so don't stress about workin' or anything, just take it easy: 19. Alright fam, we gotta bring the heat to the LORD with some lit sacrifices. We're talking two young bullocks, one ram, and seven flawless lambs straight outta their first year. No imperfections allowed, ya heard? 20. For their offering, they shall use a mixture of flour and oil: three portions for a bullock, and two portions for a ram; 21. You gotta offer a decent amount for each lamb, like at least 10%, and do that for all the 7 lambs: 22. And a goat, like, totally for a sin offering, to, like, make an atonement for you, ya know? 23. In addition to the morning burnt offering that's supposed to be offered continuously, you gotta bring these offerings too. 24. Every day for a whole week, you gotta bring the fire-cooked meat sacrifice that smells hella good to the LORD. It's gotta be offered along with the regular burnt offering and the drink offering. 25. On the seventh day, you gotta gather together and have a chill time. No stressing 'bout work, okay? 26. And on the day of the firstfruits, when you bring a fresh food offering to the LORD, after your busy weeks are done, you shall have a righteous gathering; no boring work allowed! 27. But you should flex on the Lord with a lit burnt offering; two young bullocks, one ram, and seven fire lambs of the freshest year. 28. And their vegan dish made with flour and oil, a total of three portions for one bullock, and two portions for one ram, 29. Give like 10% of the total to one lamb, and do the same for all seven lambs. 30. And like, get one cute goat to, you know, make things right for you. 31. You gotta bring these things along with the regular burnt offering, and don't forget the food offering too. Oh, and make sure they're flawless, no imperfections allowed. And don't leave out the drink offerings either! \n",

      "Gen Z: Numbers 301. So Moses gathered all the squad leaders of the tribes and dropped this message about the Israelite crew, like, 'Yo, listen up, this is what the big man upstairs, the LORD, ordered us to do.' 2. If someone makes a promise to the LORD, or swears an oath to seriously commit themselves, they mustn't go back on their word, but instead should fulfill everything they said they would. 3. Like, if a girl makes a promise to the LORD and commits herself to it while still living with her parents, ya know, during her early days. 4. If her dad hears her promise and the commitment she's made to herself, and he doesn't object, then her promises will be honored and her commitments will be upheld. 5. But if her dad says no when he finds out, then none of the promises she made or the commitments she bound herself to will count: and the LORD will forgive her, because her dad said no. 6. And like, if she had a husband, you know, when she made a promise or said anything important, you know, that she really meant, she has to keep it, you know? Like, she can't break her promise and stuff. 7. When her husband found out about it, he didn't say anything on that day. So, her vows will still count and the commitments she made will still be binding on her. 8. But if her husband says no to her after he hears about it, then he must cancel the promise that she made and the words that she spoke to bind herself. The promise won't count for anything, and the Lord will forgive her. 9. But, like, any promise made by a widow or someone who's been divorced, you know, the vows they've made and stuff, will totally be like, still binding for them and stuff. 10. And, like, if she made a promise while living with her hubby or like, seriously swore an oath with her whole soul; 11. And when her man heard about it, he stayed quiet and didn't object. So all the promises she made and all the commitments she made to herself will still be valid. 12. But if her husband totally cancels them the moment he hears them, then whatever she said about her promises or the commitments she made shall not count. Her husband has cancelled them, and the LORD will forgive her. 13. If someone makes a promise to bring suffering upon themselves or makes a serious commitment, their spouse has the power to honor or cancel it. 14. But if her husband stays silent and doesn't say anything to oppose her from day to day, then he agrees to uphold all her commitments and promises. He confirms them because he stayed quiet when he found out about them. 15. But if he cancels them in any way after hearing them, then he will be held responsible for her wrongdoing. 16. These are the rules that the LORD told Moses to follow, between a guy and his wife, and between a dad and his daughter who's still young and living at home. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 301. And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This {is} the thing which the LORD hath commanded. 2. If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth. {break: Heb. profane} 3. If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, {being} in her father's house in her youth; 4. And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 5. But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her. 6. And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; {she vowed: Heb. her vows were upon her} 7. And her husband heard {it,} and held his peace at her in the day that he heard {it}: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. 8. But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard {it}; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her. 9. But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her. 10. And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath; 11. And her husband heard {it}, and held his peace at her, {and} disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. 12. But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard {them; then} whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her. 13. Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void. 14. But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which {are} upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard {them}. 15. But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard {them}; then he shall bear her iniquity. 16. These {are} the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, {being yet} in her youth in her father's house. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 311. So, like, God starts talking to Moses and He's all like, 2. Make sure to get back at those Midianites for the Israelites, and once you're done, it'll be your time to join your crew. 3. So Moses addressed the crew, and he was like, 'Yo, get ready for battle! Pick out some soldiers and send them to face the Midianites. It's time to show the Midianites who's boss and get revenge for the LORD! 4. You gotta send a thousand warriors from each tribe, representing all the tribes of Israel, to battle. Yep, that's right, a thousand from each tribe! 5. So, like, each of the twelve tribes of Israel, they had, like, a thousand warriors, so in total there were twelve thousand warriors, ready to fight and stuff. 6. So Moses gathered up a thousand warriors from each tribe and sent them, along with Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest, to fight. They were equipped with sacred weapons and had trumpets in their hands to sound the alarm. 7. So they went up against the Midianites, just like God told Moses to do, and they killed all the dudes. 8. And they totally wrecked the kings of Midian, along with the other dudes they took down: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. Balaam, son of Beor, got sliced and diced with a sword too. 9. So, like, the Israelites totally captured all the women from Midian, along with their kids. Oh, and they also snatched up all their cows, sheep, and basically all their stuff. 10. And they totally torched all their cities where they lived, and all their swanky castles, with like, fire. 11. And they grabbed all the loot, all the swag, from both humans and animals. 12. So they brought the prisoners, the loot, and all the goodies to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the whole crew of Israelites at the camp by the Moab plains, close to the Jordan River near Jericho. 13. So Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the cool leaders of the squad went out to meet them outside the camp. 14. And Moses got mad at the squad leaders, you know, the ones in charge of thousands and hundreds, who came back from the fight. (The fight, ya know, the war squad) 15. Yo, Moses was like, did y'all keep all them women alive tho? 16. Yo, check it out. These peeps, influenced by Balaam's advice, straight up disrespected the LORD by gettin' involved with some messed-up stuff at Peor. And lemme tell ya, a plague hit the whole crew of the LORD. 17. So, like, make sure to take out all the young dudes and any women who've, you know, been with a guy. Just sayin'. {him: Hebrew for a dude} 18. But like, spare all the young women who haven't been with anyone, like, ya know, doin' the dirty deed. Keep 'em for yourselves, I guess. 19. So, like, you guys gotta stay outside the camp for a whole week. Anyone who's taken someone's life or touched a dead body, ya gotta cleanse yourselves and your prisoners on the third and seventh day. 20. Give everything you wear, all your animal skin items, anything made of goat hair, and all wooden objects a thorough cleaning. 21. Yo, listen up! Eleazar the priest was talking to the soldiers who were headed to battle. He was like, 'Yo, dudes! This is the deal - the law that the LORD told Moses to follow.' 22. Like, only the sick gold, the lit silver, the dope brass, the hardcore iron, the rad tin, and the chill lead, 23. Anything that can withstand fire should be passed through fire to make it clean, and then purified with water of separation. But anything that cannot withstand fire should be passed through water. 24. On the seventh day, don't forget to freshen up and throw those dirty clothes in the wash. Once you're clean, you can come back to the camp with confidence. 25. God like totally spoke to Moses, and He was all like, 26. Yo, count all the stuff we took from our enemies, like people and animals, okay? You, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community should do it together. Just saying, the people we captured are also included. No big deal. 27. And split the loot in two; between those who fought the war, who went out into battle, and among the whole group: 28. So basically, let's give something special to the LORD from all the warriors who went out to battle. It should be like one out of every five hundred people, and also from the livestock like cows, donkeys, and sheep too! 29. Get some of their share and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the LORD. 30. And out of the Israelites' half, you gotta take one part out of every fifty people, cows, donkeys, all sorts of animals, and give them to the Levites, who take care of the LORD's tabernacle. {goats: or, goats} 31. So like, Moses and Eleazar, the priest, totally followed exactly what the LORD told Moses to do. They were on point, no questions asked. 32. And the loot, the leftovers from the stuff the soldiers took, was, like, a totally massive pile of six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, yo! 33. And 72,000 cows, 34. And 61,000 donkeys, 35. And there were a total of thirty-two thousand women who were virgins and had not yet had sexual relations with a man. 36. The squad that went all out in battle had a whopping 307,500 sheep on their side. That's like a serious flex, man. 37. The LORD received six hundred and seventy-five sheep as tribute. 38. There were like, 36K beefs, and the LORD's cut was like 72, you know, as tribute. 39. And there were 30,500 donkeys; of those, the LORD's share was sixty-one. 40. And there were like 16k people, and the Lord's cut was about 32 people. 41. So Moses gave the LORD'S tribute, the heave offering, to Eleazar the priest, just as the LORD had told Moses to do. 42. And of the Israelites' fam, which Moses split from the homies in battle, 43. So, like, there were, like, 300k and 30k and 7.5k sheep for the congregation. 44. And 36,000 cows, 45. And like, 30k donkeys and 500, 46. And like, there were, like, sixteen thousand people, you know?;) 47. Moses took a fraction (1/50) from the Israelites, including people and animals, and gave them to the Levites. The Levites were responsible for taking care of the tabernacle as the LORD commanded Moses. 48. So, like, the high-ranking officers in charge of like, thousands of people, you know, the leaders of the thousands and hundreds, they all came up to Moses, you feel me? 49. So they were like, Mosess, just to let you know, we totally got a head count of all the dudes on our watch, and guess what? Not even one of them is missing. Not even a single dude, bro!' 50. So, we're offering a gift to the LORD. It's like everything cool we've acquired, you know? Like fancy gold stuff, bling chains, bracelets, rings, earrings, and even those trendy tablets. It's our way of making things right with our souls before the LORD. 51. So Moses and Eleazar, the priest, collected all the cool gold and fancy jewelry from them. 52. And the total amount of gold they offered to the LORD, from the leaders of thousands and hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. (Note: the offering here referred to as 'heave offering' in Hebrew) 53. The soldiers were all about that loot life, each one snatching up some goodies for themselves. 54. So, Moses and Eleazar, the priest, collected the gold from the leaders of the thousands and the hundreds, and they brought it into the meeting place as a way to remember the Israelites in front of the LORD. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 311. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people. 3. And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian. 4. Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war. {Of...: Heb. A thousand of a tribe, a thousand of a tribe} 5. So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of {every} tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 6. And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of {every} tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand. 7. And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males. 8. And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; {namely}, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. 9. And the children of Israel took {all} the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. 10. And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire. 11. And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, {both} of men and of beasts. 12. And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which {are} by Jordan {near} Jericho. 13. And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. 14. And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, {with} the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle. {battle: Heb. host of war} 15. And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? 16. Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD. 17. Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. {him: Heb. a male} 18. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. 19. And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify {both} yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day. 20. And purify all {your} raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats' {hair}, and all things made of wood. {that...: Heb. instrument, or, vessel of skins} 21. And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This {is} the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses; 22. Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 23. Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make {it} go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water. 24. And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp. 25. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 26. Take the sum of the prey that was taken, {both} of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: {that...: Heb. of the captivity} 27. And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation: 28. And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, {both} of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep: 29. Take {it} of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, {for} an heave offering of the LORD. 30. And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD. {flocks: or, goats} 31. And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. 32. And the booty, {being} the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, 33. And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 34. And threescore and one thousand asses, 35. And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him. 36. And the half, {which was} the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep: 37. And the LORD'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen. 38. And the beeves {were} thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute {was} threescore and twelve. 39. And the asses {were} thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD'S tribute {was} threescore and one. 40. And the persons {were} sixteen thousand; of which the LORD'S tribute {was} thirty and two persons. 41. And Moses gave the tribute, {which was} the LORD'S heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses. 42. And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the men that warred, 43. (Now the half {that pertained unto} the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand {and} seven thousand and five hundred sheep, 44. And thirty and six thousand beeves, 45. And thirty thousand asses and five hundred, 46. And sixteen thousand persons;) 47. Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, {both} of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. 48. And the officers which {were} over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses: 49. And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which {are} under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. {charge: Heb. hand} 50. We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD. {gotten: Heb. found} 51. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, {even} all wrought jewels. 52. And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. {offering: Heb. heave offering} 53. ({For} the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.) 54. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, {for} a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 321. So, the peeps from Reuben and Gad had, like, a crazy ton of cattle, ya know? And when they checked out the land of Jazer and Gilead, they were stoked 'cause it was perfect for their cows and stuff. 2. The squad from Gad and Reuben slid into Moses' DMs, along with Eleazar the priest and the top dogs of the crew, and were like, 3. Ayy, we got Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Shebam, Nebo, and Beon (which is also known as Bethnimrah, Shebam (or should I say Shibmah?), and Beon (also called Baalmeon)) in the house! 4. Yo, God totally wrecked that place before the Israelites, but now it's like a chill spot for raising cattle and stuff. Your servants got mad livestock there, no cap. 😎 5. So they were like, if we're, like, cool with you, can we, like, have this land as, like, our home? Please don't make us cross the Jordan River. 6. So Moses asked the kids from Gad and Reuben, like, are you just gonna chill here while your bros go to war? Like, what's up with that? 7. Yo, why y'all tryna bring down the vibes of the Israel squad, making them second-guess going into the land that the LORD hooked them up with? Just let 'em live their best lives, fam! 8. Yo, that's what your ancestors did when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to peep the land. 9. So, when they checked out the scene in the Eshcol Valley and scoped out the land, they totally killed the vibe for the Israelite crew. It made them lose all their confidence and they straight-up decided not to go into the land that the LORD hooked them up with. 10. And God got really mad in that moment and was like, 11. No cap, all those guys who left Egypt and are twenty years old and older won't even get to peep the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It's because they didn't stay loyal to me like they were supposed to, you feel me? Like, they couldn't fully back me up and do everything I asked. It's a straight-up disappointment, fam. 12. Yo, make sure you protect Caleb, son of Jephunneh, the Kenezite, and Joshua, son of Nun, 'cause they've been all in, faithfully following the LORD. 13. God got super mad at Israel, so he made them roam around the desert for like, forty whole years. It was punishment for all the people who did bad stuff in God's eyes, and they all eventually died out. 14. Yo, listen up fam, you're basically stepping into your dads' shoes and taking on their legacy as a bunch of sinful dudes. Like, you're totally intensifying the LORD's anger towards Israel. It's not a good look, y'know? 15. If y'all ditch Him, He'll leave ya stranded in the middle of nowhere, and you'll end up wiping out the entire crew. 16. So they're like, 'Yo, let's get closer to this dude and tell him we wanna build sheepfolds for our cattle and cities for our homies! Like, we gotta take care of our animals and make sure our little ones have a place to chill, you know? 17. We'll totally be rocking our gear in front of the Israel squad until we help them get to their destination. And our younger squad will be chilling in the city walls 'cause of the peeps already there. 18. We won't bounce back to our cribs until every Israelite has claimed their own territory. 19. So, like, we won't be getting our inheritance with them on the other side of the Jordan, you know? 'Cause our rightful stuff has been given to us on this side of the Jordan, on the east. 20. Then Moses was like, yo fam, if y'all are down to do this, and if y'all are ready to flex before the LORD in battle, 21. And all of you will flex and cross over the Jordan River in front of the LORD, until he totally wipes out his enemies, 22. And once you've conquered the land under the LORD's watch, you can totally chill and come back without any guilt in front of the LORD and the whole Israel crew. This land is gonna be yours, legit, in the eyes of the LORD. 23. But if you refuse to do that, yo, check it - you've straight up sinned against the LORD, and trust me, your sin is gonna catch up to you. 24. Make cities for your squad, and chill spots for your flocks; and stay true to your word. 25. So like, the peeps from Gad and Reuben were, like, talking to Moses and they were all, 'Yo Moses, listen up! We got your back, bro. Whatever you order, we'll totally make it happen.' 26. Our squad, our babez, our pets, and all our swag, gonna be chillin' in the cities of Gilead: 27. But we, your squad, will go ahead, fully equipped for the fight, in front of the LORD, ready to battle, just like you said, bro. 28. So Moses was like, 'Yo, Eleazar the priest, Joshua, and all the big shots leading the tribes of Israel, listen up.' 29. And Moses was like, yo listen up! If the squad from Gad and Reuben are willing to roll with you across the Jordan, fully geared up for battle and ready to go before the LORD, and if we successfully conquer the land, then we gotta hook them up with the land of Gilead as their rightful property, no doubt about it:  30. But, like, if they don't wanna join you on the epic quest all ready to fight, it's cool, they can still get their own crib in the land of Canaan. 31. And the kids of Gad and the kids of Reuben were like, 'Yo, we got you fam! Whatever the LORD said to us, we're totally gonna do it!' 32. We're gonna flex our weapons and roll up in front of the LORD, ready to vibe in the land of Canaan, so we can fully claim our inheritance on this side of the Jordan. 33. So, Moses hooked up the children of Gad, the children of Reuben, and half of the tribe of Manasseh (you know, from Joseph's fam) with the kingdom of Sihon, the Amorite king, and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan. He gave them the land, along with all the dope cities in the area. Like, the whole package, man. 34. So like, the kids from Gad totally built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 35. And like, there were these places, you know, Atroth, Shophan, Jaazer, and Jogbehah. Oh, and Jaazer was also sometimes called Jazer, #justsaying. 36. So there were these cities called Bethnimrah and Bethharan, totally fortified and secure. They even had sheep pens and everything. Oh, by the way, Bethnimrah was also known as Nimrah. Pretty lit, right? 37. So, like, the dudes from Reuben, they were all, like, building stuff in Heshbon, Elealeh, and Kirjathaim, you know? 38. So, like, Nebo and Baalmeon, they, like, totally changed their names, you know? Oh, and Shibmah too, FYI! And they, like, came up with new names for all the cities they built. They were all like, 'Let's give these cities some fresh names!' Ya feel me? 39. And the squad of Machir, the son of Manasseh, rolled up to Gilead, reclaimed it, and flexed on the Amorite squad that was chillin' there. 40. So Moses totally passed along Gilead to Machir, Manasseh's son, and let him have his own crib there like a boss. 41. So Jair, Manasseh's son, went and claimed those little towns and named them Havothjair. 42. So Nobah went and claimed Kenath and its surrounding villages, and he named it Nobah after himself. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 321. Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place {was} a place for cattle; 2. The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying, 3. Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, {Nimrah: also called, Bethnimrah} {Shebam: also called, Shibmah} {Beon: also called, Baalmeon} 4. {Even} the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, {is} a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle: 5. Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, {and} bring us not over Jordan. 6. And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here? 7. And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them? {discourage: Heb. break} 8. Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land. 9. For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them. 10. And the LORD'S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying, 11. Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: {wholly...: Heb. fulfilled after me} 12. Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD. 13. And the LORD'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed. 14. And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel. 15. For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people. 16. And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 17. But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 18. We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. 19. For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward. 20. And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war, 21. And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him, 22. And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD. 23. But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out. 24. Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. 25. And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. 26. Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead: 27. But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith. 28. So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel: 29. And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession: 30. But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan. 31. And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do. 32. We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan {may be} ours. 33. And Moses gave unto them, {even} to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, {even} the cities of the country round about. 34. And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 35. And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah, {Jaazer: also called, Jazer} 36. And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep. {Bethnimrah: also called, Nimrah} 37. And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim, 38. And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded. {gave...: Heb. they called by names the names of the cities} 39. And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which {was} in it. 40. And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein. 41. And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair. 42. And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 331. So, basically, here's the deal: these are the epic adventures of the Israelite squad. They peaced out of Egypt, flexin' their powerful army, all thanks to the tag team effort of Moses and Aaron. 2. So Moses, like, totally wrote down all the places they went as they journeyed, 'cause the Lord told him to. And these, like, are the places they went to as they journeyed. 3. So, like, the Israelites left Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day; right after the passover, they bounced outta there with confidence, in front of all the Egyptians. It was epic! 4. So, like, the Egyptians, right? They totally buried all their firstborns, because the LORD had like smitten them or whatever. And get this, the LORD straight up executed judgments on their gods too. Like, talk about some divine power moves, amirite? 5. So, the Israelite squad bounced out of Rameses and set up camp in Succoth. 6. And they, like, left Succoth and set up camp in Etham, which is, like, right on the edge of the wilderness. 7. And they left Etham and went back to Pihahiroth, which is in front of Baalzephon, and set up camp before Migdol. 8. So they left Pihahiroth and crossed the big sea, all the way into the huge desert. They traveled for three days in the wild Etham, and finally set up camp in Marah. 9. And they left Marah and went to Elim: and in Elim there were twelve cool water spots, and seventy palm trees; and they set up camp there. 10. And they bounced from Elim, and set up camp by the Red sea. 11. And they left the Red Sea and set up camp in the wildnerness of Sin. 12. And they like, totally left the desert of Sin, and set up camp in Dophkah. 13. And they left Dophkah and set up camp in Alush. 14. So they left Alush and set up camp at Rephidim, but there was like, zero water for the people to drink. So not cool, dude. 15. And they bounced from Rephidim and set up camp in the wild lands of Sinai. 16. And they left the Sinai Desert and set up camp at Kibrothhattaavah. {Kibrothhattaavah means the burial grounds of desire} 17. So they left Kibrothhattaavah and set up camp in Hazeroth. 18. And they bounced from Hazeroth, and set up camp in Rithmah. 19. So they bounced from Rithmah and set up camp at Rimmonparez. 20. And they left Rimmonparez, and set up camp in Libnah. 21. And they left Libnah and set up camp at Rissah. 22. So they moved from Rissah and set up camp in Kehelathah. 23. And they moved on from Kehelathah and set up camp at mount Shapher. 24. And they like, went away from this mountain Shapher, and like, set up camp in Haradah. 25. So they left Haradah and set up camp in Makheloth. 26. And they left Makheloth and set up camp at Tahath. 27. And they left Tahath and set up camp at Tarah. 28. And they like, totally left Tarah and set up camp in Mithcah. 29. And they like totally moved from Mithcah and set up camp in Hashmonah. 30. And they bounced outta Hashmonah and set up camp at Moseroth. 31. So they left Moseroth and set up camp in Benejaakan. 32. And they left Benejaakan and set up camp at Horhagidgad. 33. So they left Horhagidgad and set up camp in Jotbathah. 34. So they left Jotbathah and set up camp at Ebronah. 35. So they bounced outta Ebronah and set up camp at Eziongaber. 36. And they left Eziongaber and set up camp in the Zin wilderness, also known as Kadesh. 37. So they left Kadesh and set up camp at Mount Hor, on the edge of the land of Edom. 38. So, like, Aaron, the priest dude, went up this mountain called Hor because the LORD told him to, and yeah, he died there. This happened in the fortieth year after the kids of Israel left Egypt, specifically on the first day of the fifth month. Sad stuff. 39. And Aaron was like, super old, he reached the age of 123 and then passed away on mount Hor. 40. Yo, King Arad the Canaanite, who was livin' it up down south in Canaan, caught wind of the Israelite kids on their way over. 41. So they left mount Hor and set up camp in Zalmonah. 42. So they left Zalmonah and set up camp in Punon. 43. So they left Punon and set up camp in Oboth. 44. And they bounced outta Oboth, and set up camp in Ijeabarim, right on the Moab border. {Ijeabarim: aka, stacks of Abarim} 45. Then they left Iim and set up camp in Dibongad. 46. And they moved from Dibongad, and set up camp in Almondiblathaim. 47. And they like totally left Almondiblathaim and set up camp in the sick mountains of Abarim, right in front of Nebo. 48. And they left the mountains of Abarim and set up camp in the plains of Moab near the Jordan River, close to Jericho. 49. And they camped by the Jordan River, from Bethjesimoth all the way to Abelshittim in the plains of Moab. (Abelshittim means the plains of Shittim) 50. So, like, God was talking to Moses, right? They were chillin' in the plains of Moab, near the Jordan River, ya know, close to Jericho. And this is what God said... 51. Yo, listen up, Israel fam. When you've crossed over the Jordan and set foot in Canaan, 52. So basically, you gotta kick out everyone living in that land before you and get rid of all their pics and melt-downs. And don't forget to totally tear down all those popular hangout spots they have. 53. And you gotta take over the land, make it your home, 'cause I've totally given it to you to chill out there. 54. So, like, here's the deal: you guys are gonna split up the land by drawing straws or whatever, and each family gets their own piece. The bigger families get more land, and the smaller families get less land. Each person's piece will be wherever their straw falls, based on their family tribe. Ye shall inherit, whether you get a lot or just a little, ya know? 55. But like, if you don't kick all the people living in that land out totally, then it's gonna be a major pain in the butt for you. They're gonna bug you so much in the place you live, poking your eyes and poking you in the side. It won't be a chill situation. 56. And guess what? I'm totally gonna treat you just like I planned to treat them. \n",

And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians. 4.

And ye shall dispossess {the inhabitants} of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it. 54. And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: {and} to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's {inheritance} shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit. {give the more...: Heb. multiply his inheritance} {give the less...: Heb. diminish his inheritance} 55. But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them {shall be} pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. 56. Moreover it shall come to pass, {that} I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them. \n",
      "Gen Z: Numbers 341. God hit up Moses with a message like, 2. Yo, listen up, Israel! So, when you finally reach the land of Canaan, which is like totally gonna be your inheritance and everything, make sure to take note of the whole shebang, like the complete package of Canaan and all its surroundings, you feel me? 3. So, like, your southern area is gonna go from this super remote place called Zin all the way along the coast of Edom, and your southern border is gonna be like the very edge of the salt sea towards the east: 4. And your territory will extend from the south until the Akrabbim hike, continuing through Zin. It will stretch all the way from the south to Kadeshbarnea, then move on to Hazaraddar and Azmon. 5. And the boundary will go all the way from Azmon to the river of Egypt, and it will end at the sea. 6. And for your west border, you'll have the lit Great Sea vibes. Straight flexin' by the water, that's your vibe fam. 7. And this is where you'll set your north boundary: starting from the huge ocean, go ahead and mark out Mount Hor for yourselves: 8. Yo, head up from mount Hor and peep where your territory ends at the entrance of Hamath; the boundary is gonna stretch all the way to Zedad, fam: 9. And, like, the border will totally extend to Ziphron, and, you know, it will like end at Hazarenan. That's gonna be your north border, dude. 10. So, like, you gotta mark off your eastern border starting from Hazarenan all the way to Shepham, like duh: 11. And the boundary will stretch from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; it will go down and extend to the shore of the sea of Chinnereth towards the east: {shore of the sea: in their language, it means edge of the sea} 12. And the boundary will extend to the Jordan River, and the outer limits will reach the Dead Sea: this will be your land and its surrounding area. 13. So Moses was like, 'Yo, listen up, Israelites. This is the land you're gonna get, all thanks to the big man upstairs. He said it's gonna be divided among nine and a half tribes, by drawing lots and stuff. 14. So, like, the fam of Reuben's kids, ya know, based on their family line, and the fam of Gad's kids, also based on their family line, they totally got their rightful shares of the inheritance, and even half of the Manasseh fam got theirs too. 15. The two tribes and the half tribe got their share on this side of Jordan, close to Jericho, towards the sunrise. 16. God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up' 17. Here are the dudes who will split up the land for you: Eleazar the priest and Joshua, Nun's son. 18. And y'all gotta pick a leader from each tribe to split up the land for everyone to inherit. 19. These are the guys' names: From the crew of Judah, we got Caleb, Jephunneh's son. 20. And from the squad of the fam of the peeps of Simeon, Shemuel, Ammihud's kid. 21. From the tribe of Benjamin, there's Elidad, Chislon's child. 22. And the cool leader of the tribe of the squad of the children of Dan, Bukki, the son of Jogli. 23. Yo, Hanniel, son of Ephod, was the prince of the tribe of Manasseh, representing the children of Joseph. 24. And the leader of the squad from the crew of the Ephraim fam, Kemuel, son of Shiphtan. 25. And the leader of the squad representing the squad of the Zebulun squad, Elizaphan, the cool offspring of Parnach. 26. And the cool leader of the squad from the posse of the children of Issachar, Paltiel, the son of Azzan. 27. And the cool leader of the squad from the tribe of Asher was Ahihud, Shelomi's son, my dudes. 28. And the cool leader of the squad from the Naphtali fam, Pedahel (A.K.A. 'Pedro') - Ammihud's kid. 29.

      "KJV: Numbers 341. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 2. Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan; (this {is} the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, {even} the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:) 3. Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward: 4. And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon: 5. And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea. 6. And {as for} the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west border. 7. And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor: 8. From mount Hor ye shall point out {your border} unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad: 9. And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border. 10. And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham: 11.

And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about. 13.

      "Gen Z: Numbers 351. So God was like talking to Moses, right? They were chilling in this place called Moab near the Jordan River, close to Jericho. And here's what God had to say... 2. Tell the Israelites to hook up the Levites with some real estate in their hood. They gotta get cities to chill in, and don't forget to toss in some chill suburbs surrounding those cities. 3. And they'll have cool cities to live in, with big open spaces for their cows, their stuff, and all their cool pets. 4. And the chill hangouts of the cities, which you gotta hook the Levites up with, should go from the city walls and spread out to about a thousand cubits in every direction. 5. Bruh, you gotta measure like two thousand cubits from each side of the city: east, south, west, and north. And the city itself will be right in the middle. That's gonna be like the suburbs for those cities, ya know? 6. And you gotta give six cities to the Levites as safe havens for anyone who accidentally kills someone, so they can run there for protection. Plus, you gotta add another forty-two cities on top of that. It's like extra support, ya know? 7. So, like, you gotta give a total of 48 cities to the Levites, ya know? And, um, make sure you include their suburbs too. Just keep it cool and give 'em what they need, alright? 8. And you should totally hand over the cities to the cool kids of Israel, yo! Like, if they have a lot, give 'em a lot; but if they only got a few, just give 'em a few, man. Everyone needs to chip in and give some cities to the Levites based on the land they got, you dig? Like, it's their inheritance and all, dude! 9. And God was like, 'Yo Moses, listen up,' 10. Yo, Israel fam, listen up! Once you cross that Jordan River and step into Canaan, I got something to say to y'all. 11. So, like, you gotta choose some cities where peeps can run to if they accidentally take someone's life, you know? Like, if they didn't mean to do it or it was a mistake or something, they can escape there for safety. It's all about offering them a place to go when they didn't do it on purpose. #accidentshappen #safetyfirst 12. So basically, these cities are like safe havens where someone who accidentally killed another person can go and not get punished right away. They gotta wait until they go to court and face the whole community before anything happens. 13. And, like, out of all these cities you're gonna hand over, you're totally gonna have like six chill cities where people can, like, feel safe, you know? 14. You gotta hook it up with three cities on this side of Jordan, and three more in Canaan, which will be like safe havens, y'know. 15. So, like, there are gonna be six chill cities where the Israelites and even outsiders can escape to if they accidentally kill someone. It's a safe haven, you know? 16. And if someone hits another person with an iron object and causes their death, they are a murderer. The murderer must be executed without fail. 17. And if he hits him with a rock and the person dies, he's a straight-up murderer. The murderer must without a doubt be executed. 18. But, like, if he, like, hits him with, like, a wooden weapon and the guy, you know, dies, then he's totally a murderer, dude. And, like, the punishment for murder is, like, death for sure. 19. The person seeking justice will personally take down the murderer: when they confront each other, the murderer will be taken down. 20. But if he deliberately attacks someone out of hatred, or plans to harm them and succeeds in causing their death; 21. If someone intentionally hurts another person and causes their death, they deserve the same punishment. That's because they've committed murder, and the one seeking justice should also take their life when they have the chance to. 22. But if he accidentally attacks him, without any ill intent, or if he throws something at him without planning it in advance, 23. Or, like, if you accidentally throw a stone at someone without realizing it and they die, even though you weren't trying to hurt them or anything, like they weren't your enemy and you didn't want to harm them or whatever: 24. Yo, the squad gotta make a decision between the one who did the killing and the one who's out for blood, based on these rules:  25. The crew gotta help the killer escape from the blood avenger and bring them back to their safe city where they were running to. They gotta stay there until the high priest, who got anointed with holy oil, kicks the bucket. 26. But yo, if the one who caused the death sitch comes out of the city of protection where they took refuge; 27. If the person seeking revenge finds the one who committed the crime outside the safe zone of the city, and the avenger takes their life, the avenger will not be considered guilty of shedding blood. 28. Yo, like, he's gotta stay put in the city of his refuge until the high priest kicks the bucket. But once the high priest is gone, the killer can go back to his own turf. 29. So like, these rules are gonna be, like, forever and ever, for real, like a legit guideline for you and your crew, no matter where you live. No cap. 30. If anyone takes someone's life, the killer will be executed, as confirmed by multiple witnesses. However, a single witness won't be enough to bring about someone's death penalty. 31. And like, you totally can't be paying off a murderer, especially if they're like, totally guilty and deserve the death penalty. No way, man. They gotta face the consequence and be put to death for real. 32. And you can't bribe someone who has escaped to the city of refuge, to let them come back and live in the land, until the priest dies. 33. So, like, make sure you don't mess up the land you're living in, okay? 'Cause blood stains and contaminates the land, and there's no way to clean it up except by the blood of the one who caused the mess. You can't just make it go away, ya know? 34. So, like, don't mess up the land you're gonna live in, where I chillax, because I, the LORD, hang out with the children of Israel. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 351. And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan {near} Jericho, saying, 2.

And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts. 4. And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, {shall reach} from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about. 5. And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city {shall be} in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities. 6. And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites {there shall be} six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities. {to them...: Heb. above them ye shall give} 7. {So} all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites {shall be} forty and eight cities: them {shall ye give} with their suburbs. 8. And the cities which ye shall give {shall be} of the possession of the children of Israel: from {them that have} many ye shall give many; but from {them that have} few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth. {he...: Heb. they inherit} 9. And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 10. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan; 11. Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares. {at...: Heb. by error} 12. And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment. 13. And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge. 14. Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, {which} shall be cities of refuge. 15. These six cities shall be a refuge, {both} for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither. 16. And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he {is} a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 17. And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he die, he {is} a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. {with...: Heb. with a stone of the hand} 18. Or {if} he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he {is} a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 19. The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him. 20. But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die; 21. Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote {him} shall surely be put to death; {for} he {is} a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him. 22. But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait, 23. Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing {him} not, and cast {it} upon him, that he die, and {was} not his enemy, neither sought his harm: 24. Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments: 25. And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil. 26. But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled; 27. And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood: {he...: Heb. no blood shall be to him} 28. Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession. 29. So these {things} shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 30. Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person {to cause him} to die. 31. Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which {is} guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death. {guilty...: Heb. faulty to die} 32. And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest. 33.

      "Gen Z: Numbers 361. So, like, the main dads of the clans from the crew of Gilead, who was Manasseh's grandson and from the Joseph fam, they approached Moses and the big shots, the top dads of the Israelites: 2. So basically, they were like, God was all like to my dude, give the land to the Israelite kids by doing this whole lottery thing. And my dude, he was just following orders from God to give Zelophehad's daughters their rightful inheritance, you know? 3. And if they marry someone from a different tribe of the Israelite people, their inheritance will be taken away from our ancestral inheritance and given to the tribe they belong to. This means their share will be removed from our portion of land. 4. And when it's time for the jubilee of the Israelites, their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe they belong to. This means that their inheritance will be transferred from the tribe of our ancestors, to the tribe they're joining. 5. So Moses was like, yo fam, listen up! This is what the LORD wants us to do. The tribe of Joseph's boys is speaking some real truths, man. 6. So, like, God's got some rules for the daughters of Zelophehad. He basically says, 'Hey, you can marry whoever you want, but make sure it's someone from your dad's tribe.' It's all about keeping it in the family, ya know? 7. The children of Israel can't just switch tribes like that. Each one has to stick to the tribe their ancestors were from and hold onto their inheritance. #FamilyLegacy 8. So, like, if a girl inherits land in one of the tribes of Israel, she's gotta marry someone from her dad's tribe. This way, everyone in Israel gets to keep the land that's been passed down to them from their ancestors, ya know? 9. No switching of inheritances between tribes, okay? Each tribe of the Israelites gotta stick to their own stuff, got it? 10. As the LORD told Moses, the daughters of Zelophehad did exactly what He said: 11. So Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, who were Zelophehad's daughters, got married to their father's brothers' sons. 12. And they got hitched to the squads of the homies from the fam of Manasseh, Joseph's offspring. And their property stayed within the tribe of their dad's fam. Bruh, it was like a family thing, you feel me? 13. So, like, these are the rules and stuff, that the LORD told Moses to give to the Israelites in those chill plains near Moab, close to the Jordan River, you know, like right by Jericho. \n",
      "KJV: Numbers 361. And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel: 2. And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. 3. And if they be married to any of the sons of the {other} tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance. {whereunto...: Heb. unto whom they shall be} 4. And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers. {whereunto...: Heb. unto whom they shall be} 5. And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well. 6. This {is} the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry. {marry: Heb. be wives} 7. So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. {keep...: Heb. cleave to the, etc} 8. And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers. 9. Neither shall the inheritance remove from {one} tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance. 10. Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad: 11. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons: 12. {And} they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. {into...: Heb. to some that were of the families} 13. These {are} the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan {near} Jericho. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 11. Yo, listen up! Here are the words that Moses said to all the peeps of Israel while they were chillin' on this side of the Jordan River, in the middle of nowhere. They were in a plain across from the Red Sea, near Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab. (FYI, the Red Sea was also known as Zuph) 2. It only takes eleven days to get from Horeb to Kadeshbarnea if you take the route through mount Seir. 3. So, like, after 40 years, in the 11th month, on the first day, Moses was talking to the children of Israel, telling them everything that the LORD had commanded him to say. 4. After he totally wrecked Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who was chilling in Heshbon, and also took down Og, the king of Bashan, who was posted up at Astaroth in Edrei: 5. Yo, across the Jordan River, in Moab, Moses started spittin' this law, like, 6. Yo, fam, check it. God hit us up at Horeb and was all like, 'Y'all been chillin' on this mountain for way too long, it's time to bounce.' 7. Yo, listen up! It's time to switch up your path and head to the Amorite mountain and all the nearby places – the plains, the hills, the valleys, down south, and even by the beach! We're talking about reaching the land of the Canaanites and going all the way to Lebanon, by the massive Euphrates River. Trust me, it's gonna be amazing! 8. Yo, listen up! Check it out, I'm hooking you up with this amazing opportunity. Go ahead and claim the land that the LORD promised to your OG dads, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It's all yours, and it's gonna be passed down to your future fam. Trust. {set: Heb. given} 9. So, like, back then I was all like, 'Yo, listen up! It's too much for me to handle y'all on my own, man! I need some backup!' 10. Yo, God has totally multiplied y'all, and guess what? You are lit af today, like a gazillion stars up in the sky. 11. May the LORD God of your parents increase your numbers a thousandfold and shower you with blessings, just as He promised you! 12. Bruh, how am I supposed to handle all this heavy drama, stress, and conflicts by myself? 13. Yo, gather up all your intellectual squad, like the ones who are smart and respected among your peeps, and I'll elevate them to be your leaders. {Take: Hebrew word means Give, just FYI} 14. And you replied to me, saying, 'That's a cool thing for us to do.' 15. So I picked the top dogs from each of your squads - the smarty pants and the popular ones - and made them the big boss over you. They became leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens. And I also appointed some cool peeps to help out in your crews. 16. Yo, listen up! I gave a straight up message to your judges back then. I was like, 'Hey, y'all gotta hear out those disputes among your fellow brothers. And when you're judging, make sure you do it fair and square, no favoritism allowed. You gotta treat everyone equally, even the ones who ain't from around here. 17. Don't favor anyone when making judgments; listen to both the little and the powerful. Don't fear anyone's opinion, because the judgment belongs to God. And if a case is too difficult for you, bring it to me, and I'll hear it out. 18. And I was like, yo, I dropped some serious wisdom bombs and told you exactly what you need to do back then. 19. So, like, when we left Horeb, we like totally journeyed through this massive and crazy wilderness, you know? It was like intense, man, just as the LORD our God told us. And then we finally made it to Kadeshbarnea. 20. So, like, I was telling you guys, we've arrived at the Amorites' turf - the mountain that our awesome God is totally hooking us up with, you know? 21. Check it out, dude, the Almighty, your God, has given you this dope land. So, like, go and claim it as He promised your ancestors. Don't stress or let anything get you down, bro. 22. So, you all came up to me and were like, 'Yo, we should totally send some people ahead of us to scope out the land and tell us the best way to go and which cities we should hit up.' 23. And I was totally down with the idea, so I picked twelve homies from y'all, one from each crew: 24. Then they like, totally hiked up the mountain and arrived at this sick valley called Eshcol, and like, totally explored it. 25. So, they grabbed some of the yummy fruits they found, brought them back to us, and shared their thoughts by saying, 'Dude, this land that the LORD our God is hooking us up with is totally awesome!' 26. But y'all were like, nah we ain't going up, and straight up rebelled against God's command, man: 27. So, like, you guys were totally complaining in your cozy tents and were like, 'OMG, the LORD totally hates us! That's why He brought us out of Egypt, just to hand us over to those Amorites and ruin our lives!' 28. Where should we go? Our friends have made us feel down, saying that the people there are bigger and taller than us, the cities are huge and fortified all the way up to the sky, and we've even seen the sons of the Anakims there. 29. I was like, don't even trip, no need to stress about those peeps. #NoFear 30. The big man upstairs, who's always one step ahead, will totally have your back and throw down for you, just like all the insane stuff he pulled off in Egypt, right in front of your eyes. 31. And out in the wild, where you saw how the LORD your God looked after you like a father looks after his son, every step of the way until you reached this spot. 32. But you totally didn't trust God, like, at all, 33. Yo, who went ahead of you to find a sick spot for you to set up your tents? They had your back with that fire at night to guide you and a boss cloud in the day to show you the way to go. 34. And God was like, totally listening to what you said, and got super angry, and was all like, 'I solemnly declare now,' 35. Honestly, none of these dudes from this messed up generation will ever lay their eyes on the awesome land that I promised to give to your ancestors. 36. Protect Caleb, son of Jephunneh, man! We'll hook him up with the land he's been exploring, along with his crew, all because he's been fully committed to rocking it for the LORD. #loyalty 37. God was mad at me on your behalf and told me I can't go in there either. 38. Yo, Joshua, son of Nun, is ready to take charge. He's stepping up to lead Israel and secure that land. Show him some love and support, 'cause he's gonna make sure Israel gets their rightful inheritance. 39. And those kidz you thought would be like easy targets and your offspring who were clueless about right and wrong back then, they'll totally score that place and own it like a boss. 40. Yo, listen up! It's time for you to make a move and head into the wilderness, following the path that leads to the Red Sea. 41. So, we were like, 'Yeah, we messed up big time, and we're totally gonna fight now. Just like God told us to.' And we all geared up with our weapons, ready to head up the hill. 42. God was like, 'Listen up fam, tell these peeps not to even think about going up there or trying to fight. I'm not rollin' with ya'll on this one. If you do, you best believe you're gonna get wrecked by your enemies.' 43. So I talked to you, but you guys totally ignored me and straight up disobeyed the LORD's command. You decided to be all fancy and go up the hill without thinking twice. Like, you were totally reckless! 44. The Amorites living up in the hills straight up attacked you, just like bees would, and straight up wrecked you in Seir, all the way to Hormah. 45. And you came back and cried in front of the LORD, but the LORD didn't listen to you or pay attention. 46. So you stayed in Kadesh for a long time, just as you had planned. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 11. These {be} the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red {sea}, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. {the Red...: or, Zuph} 2. ({There are} eleven days' {journey} from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.) 3. And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first {day} of the month, {that} Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them; 4. After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 5. On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying, 6. The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount: 7. Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all {the places} nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates. {all...: Heb. all his neighbours} 8. Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them. {set: Heb. given} 9. And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone: 10. The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye {are} this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. 11. (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye {are}, and bless you, as he hath promised you!) 12. How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? 13. Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you. {Take: Heb. Give} 14. And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken {is} good {for us} to do. 15. So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes. {made: Heb. gave} 16. And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear {the causes} between your brethren, and judge righteously between {every} man and his brother, and the stranger {that is} with him. 17. Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; {but} ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment {is} God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring {it} unto me, and I will hear it. {respect...: Heb. acknowledge faces} 18. And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do. 19. And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea. 20. And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us. 21. Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up {and} possess {it}, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged. 22. And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come. 23. And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe: 24. And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out. 25. And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought {it} down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, {It is} a good land which the LORD our God doth give us. 26. Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God: 27. And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us. 28. Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people {is} greater and taller than we; the cities {are} great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there. {discouraged: Heb. melted} 29. Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. 30. The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 31. And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place. 32. Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, 33. Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents {in}, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day. 34. And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying, 35. Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers, 36. Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD. {wholly...: Heb. fulfilled to go after} 37. Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither. 38. {But} Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 39. Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. 40. But {as for} you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. 41. Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill. 42. And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I {am} not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies. 43. So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill. {went...: Heb. ye were presumptuous, and went up} 44. And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, {even} unto Hormah. 45. And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you. 46. So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode {there}. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 21. So, we like totally turned around and started our journey into the wild, you know, like through the Red Sea, just like the LORD told me. And guess what? We like totally circled around mount Seir for, like, so many days! 2. So God was like, 'Yo, listen up fam,' 3. Okay guys, you've been circling around this mountain for ages, it's time to change direction and head north instead. 4. Yo, tell everyone to listen up! Here's the deal: you're gonna pass through the turf of your homies, the descendants of Esau, who are chilling in Seir. And guess what? They're gonna be shook when they see you. So, make sure you keep yourselves in check, alright? 5. Don't even think of messing with them, I'm not gonna let you have any of their land, not even a tiny bit. That's 'cause I already gave mount Seir to Esau as his own property. Not a single step of that land is up for grabs. 6. You can totally cop some food from them in exchange for cash, so you can chow down; and don't forget, you gotta splash some cash on that H2O too, so you can stay hydrated. 7. Dude, like God has totally blessed you in everything you've done. He knows about your journey through this huge, wild place. For, like, forty whole years, God has totally been by your side. And, bro, you haven't even been lacking anything. 8. So we were traveling and came across our bros- the kids of Esau- who were living in Seir. We took the route that went through the plain from Elath and Eziongaber, and then we turned and kept going through the Moab wilderness. 9. Yo, chill, God was like, 'Don't mess with the Moabites and don't start any beef with them in battle, cuz I ain't giving you their land to claim as your own. See, I already promised that land to Lot's peeps over in Ar. So, just leave the Moabites alone, ya feel?' 10. Back in the day, the Emims lived there - they were a pretty awesome and massive group, just like the Anakims. 11. There were some seriously huge dudes called giants, like the Anakims. But the Moabites had a different name for them - they called them Emims. 12. The Horims used to be in Seir, but then the children of Esau took over after wiping them out. They settled in their place, just like Israel did in the land that the LORD gave them. {succeeded: which means inherited} {stead: or, room} 13. Alright fam, it's time to get moving and cross over the Zered river. So we crossed over the Zered river, you feel me? (brook: or, valley) 14. So, like, we were totally traveling from Kadeshbarnea to cross over this brook called Zered, and it took us a whole 38 years! Can you believe it? That's how long it took for all the men who were ready for battle to, like, disappear from our group, just as the LORD promised. By the way, the brook could also be a valley, ya know! 15. Like, the Lord, you know, totally had it out for them. He was all like, 'I'm gonna wipe them out from the whole crew until there was nothing left of 'em.' 16. And then, like, after all the dudes who were fighting got totally wiped out and like, died and stuff, from like, the entire population, 17. So, like, the LORD was talking to me and He said, 18. Yo, you gotta make your way through Ar and the coast of Moab today: 19. So like, when you get near the children of Ammon, don't mess with them or cause trouble. I ain't gonna let you have any of their land, 'cause I already promised it to the children of Lot as their own land. 20. So there used to be this land full of super tall people, like giants. The Ammonites actually called them Zamzummims, or Zuzims for short. 21. There were these super cool, big and numerous people known as the Anakims, but the LORD totally wiped them out to make way for another group who took their place and settled there instead: 22. Just like back in the day when God dealt with the peeps from Esau, who were chilling in Seir. He straight up wiped out the Horims, who were in their way. And then Esau's fam took over and settled there for good, up until now, fam. 23. So like, the Avims who were living in Hazerim, all the way to Azzah, were totally wiped out by the Caphtorims, who came from Caphtor. They straight up took over their land and made it their own. No joke. 24. Yo, get up and start moving, go cross over the Arnon River. Check it out, I'm giving you Sihon the Amorite, the king of Heshbon, and his land. It's time to take possession of it and engage in battle with him. Let the conquest begin! 25. Yo, today I'm gonna start spreading major fear and intimidation vibes about you to all the nations around the world. When they hear about you, they gonna straight up freak out and be filled with intense fear and anxiety because of you, no cap. 26. So I DM'd some influencers from the middle of nowhere to chat up Sihon, the boss of Heshbon. I came in peace, yo, and dropped some chill words, like, 27. Yo, can I pass through your turf? I'm gonna stick to the main road, not veering left or right. 28. Yo, hook me up with some food and water, I'll pay you. Just tryna pass through on my own two feet, no biggie. 29. (Like how Esau's fam in Seir and the Moabites in Ar treated me,) until I cross the Jordan into the lit land the LORD our God's hooking us up with. 30. But Sihon, the king of Heshbon, refused to let us go through his territory because the LORD your God made him stubborn and resistant, so that he could be defeated by you, as it is evident today. 31. So, like, God was all like, 'Yo, listen up! I've already started handing over Sihon and his land to you. Get ready to take possession of it and make it yours.' 32. So, like, Sihon totally decided to come at us with his whole crew, ready to throw down in Jahaz. 33. And, like, OMG, the LORD our God totally handed him over to us; and we totally owned him, his sons, and all his peeps. 34. And we totally took over all his cities back then, and completely wiped out all the guys, girls, and kids. We left no one behind in any city: {the guys...: In Hebrew, it means all the dudes, ladies, and little ones in every city} 35. We only took the cattle as our prize, and the loot from the cities we conquered. 36. We totally dominated every city from Aroer by the river Arnon to the city by the river in Gilead. None of them were a match for us because the LORD our God made sure we conquered them all. 37. You didn't even go to the land of the Ammonites, or anywhere near the Jabbok River, or the cities up in the mountains. We were strictly told not to go there by the LORD our God. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 21. Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days. 2. And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 3. Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. 4. And command thou the people, saying, Ye {are} to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: 5. Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau {for} a possession. {no...: Heb. even to the treading of the sole of the foot} 6. Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. 7. For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God {hath been} with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. 8. And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 9. And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land {for} a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot {for} a possession. {Distress...: or, Use no hostility against Moab} 10. The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; 11. Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims. 12. The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them. {succeeded: Heb. inherited} {stead: or, room} 13. Now rise up, {said I}, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered. {brook: or, valley} 14. And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, {was} thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them. {brook: or, valley} 15. For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed. 16. So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people, 17. That the LORD spake unto me, saying, 18. Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: 19. And {when} thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon {any} possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot {for} a possession. 20. (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; {Zamzummims: also called, Zuzims} 21. A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead: 22. As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day: 23. And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, {even} unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.) 24. Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess {it}, and contend with him in battle. {begin...: Heb. begin, possess} 25. This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations {that are} under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee. 26. And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 27. Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. 28. Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet; 29. (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us. 30. But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as {appeareth} this day. 31. And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. 32. Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. 33. And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. 34. And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain: {the men...: Heb. every city of men, and women, and little ones} 35. Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took. 36. From Aroer, which {is} by the brink of the river of Arnon, and {from} the city that {is} by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us: 37. Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, {nor} unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 31. So, we turned around and headed towards Bashan, and guess what? Og, the king of Bashan, along with his whole crew, came out to fight us at Edrei. 2. So, God was like, don't be scared, I got you covered! I'll hand over this dude, his crew, and his whole land to you. Just do to him what you did to that Amorite king Sihon who lived in Heshbon, no biggie. 3. So like, God totally made us defeat Og, the king of Bashan, and all his peeps. We, like, completely wrecked him until there was, like, no one left. Epic win! 4. And like, we totally conquered all his cities back then, I mean, not a single city was left untouched, we took like sixty cities, the whole area of Argob, which was like Og's kingdom in Bashan. 5. These cities were totally fortified with massive walls, dope gates, and epic bars. And there were also a bunch of sick towns that weren't fortified. 6. And we completely annihilated them, just like we did to Sihon, the ruler of Heshbon. We wiped out every single person, from men and women to kids, in every city. 7. But yo, we straight up nabbed all them cows and jacked all the sick loot from them cities, like it's all ours now. 8. So, like, at that time, we totally snatched the land from those two Amorite kings, you know? It was, like, on the other side of the Jordan River, stretching from the Arnon River to Mount Hermon. Power move, y'all! 9. ({BTW} the Sidonians call it like, Sirion; and the Amorites are like, yo, it's Shenir; 10. Yo, check it out! I'm talking about all them cities in the plain, Gilead, and Bashan, all the way to Salchah and Edrei. These cities are part of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, man. 11. Yo, there was this one dude Og, the king of Bashan, who was the last of the giants. And check this out, his bed was legit made of iron! You can find it in Rabbath, where the Ammonites live. That thing was massive, man. It measured nine cubits in length and four cubits in width, using regular human-sized cubits. 12. So, like, this land that we got back then, from Aroer by the Arnon River, and half of Mount Gilead, along with its cities, I gave it to the Reubenites and Gadites. 13. So, like, the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, you know, the kingdom of Og, I totally gave it to the half tribe of Manasseh. It's all in the region of Argob, along with all of Bashan, which they used to call the land of giants, or whatever. 14. So like, Jair, Manasseh's boy, totally claimed the whole Argob region, right up to Geshuri and Maachathi. And get this, he named it Bashanhavothjair, after himself, and it's still called that to this day, fam! 15. And I hooked up Machir with Gilead, no cap. 16. I hooked up the Reubenites and the Gadites with some prime real estate - like, from Gilead all the way to the Arnon River, scoring them half the valley. Their turf extended even to the Jabbok River, which is basically the boundary of the Ammonite peeps. 17. The flat land, the Jordan River, and the whole area around it, from Chinnereth all the way to the salty sea in the east, near Ashdothpisgah. (Ashdothpisgah can be called the springs of Pisgah or the hill.) 18. So, like, back in the day, I was like, 'Yo, check it! The big man upstairs, AKA God, is hooking you up with this prime land to conquer. You gotta roll in with your crew, fully equipped and ready to fight, in front of your Israelite fam. Only the ones who can handle the heat, you know what I'm saying? Power moves all the way, fam! 19. But like, your wives, your kids, and your pets (I mean, I know you all have a ton of pets) can stay in your cities that I totally gave to you, okay? 20. Until the LORD blesses your friends with peace and also blesses you, and until they claim the land beyond Jordan that the LORD your God has given them, then you can go back to your own land that I have given you. 21. So I told Joshua, like, listen up dude, you've witnessed everything that the Lord our God has done to these two kings. And for real, the Lord will do the same to all the other kingdoms you come across, okay? 22. Don't stress about those peeps, 'cause the big man upstairs got your back and will straight up throw down for you. 23. And I was like, yo LORD, listen up, 24. Yo, God Almighty, you've straight-up started revealing your awesomeness to your servant here, showing off your straight fire power and skills. Like seriously, who else up in the heavens or down on earth can even come close to doing what you do and flexing your mad strength? 25. Yo, lemme check out the lit land on the other side of the Jordan River - that dope mountain and Lebanon. 26. But God got really mad at me because of you guys, and wouldn't even listen to me. God told me, 'That's enough, stop talking to me about this.' 27. Go to the highest point of Pisgah, and look to the west, north, south, and east. Take in the view with your own eyes, but remember that you won't be crossing the Jordan River. 28. But like, yo, Joshua needs a major boost, you know? He needs your encouragement and support. 'Cause he's legit gonna lead the way for these peeps and help them score that land you're peeping. 29. So we stayed in the valley across from Bethpeor. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 31. Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 2. And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 3. So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. 4. And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 5. All these cities {were} fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many. 6. And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. 7. But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves. 8. And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that {was} on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon; 9. ({Which} Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;) 10. All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 11. For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead {was} a bedstead of iron; {is} it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits {was} the length thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. 12. And this land, {which} we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which {is} by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 13. And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, {being} the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants. 14. Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day. 15. And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 16. And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, {which is} the border of the children of Ammon; 17. The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast {thereof}, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, {even} the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward. {Ashdothpisgah; or, the springs of Pisgah, or, the hill} 18. And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all {that are} meet for the war. {meet...: Heb. sons of power} 19. But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, ({for} I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you; 20. Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you, and {until} they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and {then} shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. 21. And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. 22. Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you. 23. And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 24. O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God {is there} in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might? 25. I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that {is} beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. 26. But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter. 27. Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold {it} with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. {Pisgah: or, the hill} 28. But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see. 29. So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 41. Yo, listen up, Israel! Pay attention to the rules and decisions that I'm teaching you so you can actually live your best life and take over the land that the LORD God gave to your ancestors. 2. Don't tweak or subtract anything from what I'm telling you. Just follow the Lord your God's commandments exactly as I've given them to you. 3. Y'all peeped exactly what the LORD did 'cause of Baalpeor: for all the dudes who were into Baalpeor, the LORD your God straight up wiped 'em out from your crew. 4. But all of you who stayed loyal to the LORD your God are still living it up to this day. 5. Listen up, fam! I've schooled you on all the rules and regulations just like the Big Man upstairs commanded me. So, when you're in the new hood and taking over, make sure to follow 'em, aight? 6. So, like, keep doing all these things, alright? 'Cause that's what makes you super smart and clever in the eyes of all the other countries. They'll hear about all these rules and regulations and be like, 'Wow, this nation is seriously wise and understanding.' 7. Which nation can flex so hard, with God so close, like our lit AF God who's always there when we slide into His DMs? 8. Yo, listen up fam! There ain't no nation out there as lit as us. Our laws and rules are straight fire, the most righteous of 'em all. I'm droppin' this knowledge on you today, no cap! 9. Yo, listen up and pay attention to yourself, like, seriously. Keep your soul in check, don't let it stray. Remember the sights you've seen, don't let 'em fade from your heart for your whole life. Share those stories with your kids and grandkids, pass 'em down for real. 10. Remember that day you were in Horeb, standing before the LORD your God? He told me to gather everyone so they could hear His words. It was all about learning to respect and honor Him every day of our lives on this earth, and passing that knowledge down to future generations. 11. You all got close and stood at the base of the mountain. The mountain was literally on fire, reaching up to the sky, and it was surrounded by darkness, clouds, and super thick fog. 12. So, like, God totally talked to you from the fire, dude. You heard the words loud and clear but couldn't see any image, man. It was just all about the voice, ya know? 13. So basically, God was like, 'Yo, listen up! I'm about to drop some major truth on you. Check it, I got these ten commandments that I want you to follow. They're so important, I even wrote them down on these two stone tablets.' 14. Yo, at that time, God was like, 'Listen up, peeps! I gotta teach you some rules and laws, so that when you reach the new land, you can follow them.' 15. So like, seriously, pay attention and be super aware of yourselves, okay? 'Cause, like, you didn't see any kind of image or anything when the LORD spoke to you in Horeb, right from the middle of the fire. It was, like, wild, man! 16. So you don't mess yourselves up, don't go making some statue that looks like anything, whether it's a dude or a chick. 17. Like, imagine any cool animal that's walking on the earth, or like, any bird with wings that's flying up in the sky, 18. Yo, there's no chillin' with any creepy crawlies on the ground or any fish chillin' down in the deep waters. 19. And like, don't go all star-struck when you look up at the sky and see the sun, the moon, and all the cool stars. I mean, it's totally awesome and all, but you shouldn't start worshiping and serving them. God was super generous and shared them with all nations around the world, ya know? 20. Yo, the big man upstairs led y'all outta that tough spot, like a boss. He snatched you outta Egypt, where things were rough, and made you His special peeps, just like you are now. 21. So, like, the LORD was pretty mad at me because of you guys, and He was like, 'Nah, you ain't crossing that Jordan river, and you definitely ain't entering that awesome land that the LORD your God is giving you as, like, your inheritance.' 22. Yo, I gotta kick it here and can't cross over the Jordan River, but y'all can go ahead and take over that lit land. 23. Yo, listen up! Don't forget to keep your focus on what's important. Remember the agreement that the big man upstairs, the LORD your God, made with you. He strictly said no making fancy statues or replicas of anything. That's a big no-no from the big man. 24. Like, God is like totally fierce, like a raging fire, you know? And God, like, really cares a lot and gets, like, super possessive. 25. When you start having kids and grandkids, and you've been around in this place for a while, if you start going off track and creating idols or making things that resemble stuff, and you start doing shady stuff that doesn't sit well with the LORD your God, basically trying to tick Him off... 26. Listen up, fam! I've gotta drop some truth on you. Heaven and earth are my witnesses right now, and they've got my back. So here's the deal: if you keep heading across the Jordan to take over that land, you're gonna get wrecked, like big time. Your days there will be short-lived, 'cause you're gonna be completely wiped out. 27. The LORD's gonna spread you out all over the place, and you're gonna end up being a small group in foreign lands, wherever the LORD takes you. 28. And there you'll be all about worshipping these gods that people made themselves, with their hands and stuff. Like, these gods are just made of wood and stone, bruh. They can't see, they can't hear, they can't eat, they can't even smell. Total duds, if you ask me. 29. But if you search for the LORD your God from there, you'll find {him}, as long as you really put your heart and soul into it. 30. When you're going through really tough times, and all these things are happening to you, especially in the future years, if you decide to seek God and listen to what He says, things will get better for you. 31. Hey, just a quick heads up, the LORD your God is totally all about compassion. No way will he bail on you or wipe you out, or even forget the agreement he made with your ancestors. He's totally got your back, fam! 32. Yo, like, think about all the stuff that went down in the past, like way before you were even born. Since the day God made humans on this planet, you gotta check from one end of the sky to the other if anything like this epic event has ever happened or even been talked about! 33. Did anyone ever hear God's voice coming out of the fire like you have and still survive? 34. Has God ever tried to snatch a nation from another nation, using temptations, signs, wonders, war, a powerful hand, a strong arm, and terrifying acts, just like He did when He rescued you from Egypt, right before your very eyes? 35. God made it known to you so that you'd understand that He's the one true God—there's no one else like Him. 36. He made you listen to His voice straight from heaven to teach you. On earth, He revealed Himself with a massive fire, and you heard His words right from the midst of the flames. 37. And because he was madly vibin' with your ancestors, he decided to pick their descendants and straight up flexed his epic power to free you from Egypt. 38. To kick out nations that are way more epic and powerful than you, and to bring you in so you can vibe in their land and inherit it, just like it's happening right now. 39. So like, just remember today and really think about it, that the LORD is totally the real deal, like God up in the heavens and on the earth here. There's seriously no one else like Him, no cap. 40. So, like, make sure you follow all His rules and commands that I'm telling you today. This way, everything will go smoothly for you and your descendants, and you'll have a long, awesome life on this earth that the Lord your God gave you, like, forever. 41. So Moses was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna build three cities over on this side of the Jordan River, towards the sunrise and stuff.' 42. So, if someone accidentally kills their neighbor who they didn't hate before, they can run to one of these cities and stay safe: 43. So, like, there's this place called Bezer in the middle of nowhere, where the Reubenites hang out. Then there's Ramoth in Gilead, which is like the cool spot for the Gadites. And lastly, there's Golan in Bashan, where you'll find the Manassites doing their thing. 44. And yo, this is the straight-up law that Moses dropped for the Israelite homies: 45. Yo, listen up y'all. This is the straight facts, the rules, and the laws that Moses dropped on the Israelite squad after they dipped from Egypt. 46. So, on the other side of the Jordan River, in the valley facing Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon, who was the king of the Amorites and lived in Heshbon, Moses and the Israelites totally took down Sihon after they finally escaped from Egypt. 47. They totally took over his land and the land of Og, the king of Bashan. Like, these two kings of the Amorites were straight up chilling on the other side of the Jordan river, facing the sunrise and all. 48. From Aroer, by the dope river Arnon, all the way to mount Sion, which is straight up Hermon, 49. And like, the whole area over here on the east side of the Jordan River, all the way to the super chill sea, you know, the one near the plains and stuff, by the springs of Pisgah. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 41. Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do {them}, that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you. 2. Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish {ought} from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. 3. Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you. 4. But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God {are} alive every one of you this day. 5. Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it. 6. Keep therefore and do {them}; for this {is} your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation {is} a wise and understanding people. 7. For what nation {is there so} great, who {hath} God {so} nigh unto them, as the LORD our God {is} in all {things that} we call upon him {for}? 8. And what nation {is there so} great, that hath statutes and judgments {so} righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day? 9. Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons' sons; 10. {Specially} the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and {that} they may teach their children. 11. And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness. {midst: Heb. heart} 12. And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only {ye heard} a voice. {only...: Heb. save a voice} 13. And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, {even} ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone. 14. And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it. 15. Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day {that} the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire: 16. Lest ye corrupt {yourselves}, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 17. The likeness of any beast that {is} on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 18. The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of any fish that {is} in the waters beneath the earth: 19. And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, {even} all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven. {divided: or, imparted} 20. But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, {even} out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance, as {ye are} this day. 21. Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee {for} an inheritance: 22. But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land. 23. Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, {or} the likeness of any {thing}, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. 24. For the LORD thy God {is} a consuming fire, {even} a jealous God. 25. When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt {yourselves}, and make a graven image, {or} the likeness of any {thing}, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: 26. I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong {your} days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed. 27. And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you. 28. And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 29. But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find {him}, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. 30. When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, {even} in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice; {are...: Heb. have found thee} 31. (For the LORD thy God {is} a merciful God;) he will not forsake thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them. 32. For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and {ask} from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been {any such thing} as this great thing {is}, or hath been heard like it? 33. Did {ever} people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? 34. Or hath God assayed to go {and} take him a nation from the midst of {another} nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? 35. Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he {is} God; {there is} none else beside him. 36. Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire. 37. And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt; 38. To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou {art}, to bring thee in, to give thee their land {for} an inheritance, as {it is} this day. 39. Know therefore this day, and consider {it} in thine heart, that the LORD he {is} God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: {there is} none else. 40. Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong {thy} days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever. 41. Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; 42. That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live: 43. {Namely}, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites. 44. And this {is} the law which Moses set before the children of Israel: 45. These {are} the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt, 46. On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt: 47. And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which {were} on this side Jordan toward the sunrising; 48. From Aroer, which {is} by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which {is} Hermon, 49. And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 51. So, like, Moses gathered all of Israel together and was all like, 'Listen up, y'all! I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you. These laws and rules I'm about to lay down, you gotta pay attention and follow them, you know? Don't just learn 'em, but actually do 'em.' 2. Bruh, God straight up made a deal with us at Horeb. 3. God didn't make this agreement with our parents, but with us, all the people here who are still alive today. 4. Yo, it was wild! God straight up had a convo with you, like DMs but IRL, on that mount, in the middle of all that fire! 5. (I was like, right in the middle of God and you back then, to give you His message, ya know? 'Cause you were all scared 'cause of the fire and didn't wanna go up the mountain;) and this is what I said, 6. I'm the ultimate power, your God, who rescued you from Egypt, where you were enslaved. 7. You gotta put me as your top priority, no other gods allowed. 8. Don't even think about carving any dope statues of anything up in the heavens, on the earth, or under the sea. 9. Don't be all obsessed and worship these things or be their servant. 'Cause I, the LORD your God, am pretty possessive and will totally bring consequences from the wrongdoings of the past generations to the kids for, like, a few more generations, if they're hatin' on me. 10. And being kind to thousands of those who are ride-or-die for me and stay true to my rules. 11. Don't go around casually using God's name like it's some sort of joke, because God won't let you off the hook if you do. 12. Make sure you chillax on the sabbath day and treat it as holy, because that's what the LORD your God told you to do. 13. Yo, hustle six days a week and handle all your grind: 14. But the seventh day is like a chill day, ya know? It's like a day-off vibe, dedicated to the big man upstairs. Don't even think about doing any work—like seriously, everyone needs a break. Your whole crew, even your pets and that random person crashing at your place. Let them all recharge and chillax, just like you. 15. Don't forget, bro, that you used to be a total servant back in Egypt and God, like, totally helped you escape with some crazy power moves. That's why He's telling you to chill on the Sabbath day, man. 16. Show love and respect to your parents, like how God tells you to. By doing this, you'll have a long and happy life in the land that God gave you. 17. Don't be a murderer, like seriously, not cool. 18. Don't even think about cheating on your boo, okay? 19. Don't be a thief, fam. 20. Don't spread fake news about your neighbor, okay? 21. Don't be thirsty for your neighbor's girl or be jealous of your neighbor's crib, his land, his squad, or his maid, his whip, or his ride, or anything that belongs to your neighbor. 22. Yo, listen up fam. God straight up dropped these words to the whole squad on the mount, surrounded by fire, clouds, and mad darkness. His voice was booming, no cap. And that's it, no extras. He wrote 'em down on two stone tablets and gave 'em to me. 23. So, like, when you guys heard this voice coming from the dark, and I mean, the whole mountain was legit on fire, you all came over to me, including all the leaders of your tribes and your elders. It was pretty intense, dude. 24. And you were like, guys, look, the LORD our God just totally flexed on us with His awesomeness and his sick moves. We straight up heard His voice booming out of the fire, no cap! We saw it with our own eyes, man. God actually converses with us humans and He's still alive and kickin'. 25. So, like, why should we risk dying? This epic fire is legit gonna burn us alive! If we keep hearing the voice of the LORD our God, we'll totally meet our doom. #ScaryStuff #NoThanks 26. Like, seriously, who among all the people out there has actually heard the booming voice of the Almighty God talking from the fiery flames and managed to survive that encounter? It's mind-blowing, dude! 27. Come over here and listen to everything that the LORD our God says. Then you can tell us everything that the LORD our God tells you, and we'll totally listen and follow it. 28. Yo, God heard what you guys were saying to me, and He was like, 'I've totally heard what the peeps are saying to you, and they're on point with what they've said.' 29. Man, if only they had a heart that would mad respect me and straight up follow all my commands without fail. That's the key to endless blessings and good vibes for them and their squad, for real! 30. Yo, go tell 'em to go back to their tents. 31. But like, you, just come over here and chill with me. I'll totally break down all the rules, guidelines, and fair decisions that you need to teach them. So they understand how to live when they take over the land I'm hooking them up with. 32. So, like, you gotta make sure to do exactly what the LORD your God told you to do, ya know? Don't go swerving off to the right or to the left, stick to the straight and narrow path. 33. You gotta follow all the rules that the LORD your God gave you, so you can have a good life and live long in the land you're gonna take over. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 51. And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them. {keep...: Heb. keep to do them} 2. The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. 3. The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, {even} us, who {are} all of us here alive this day. 4. The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire, 5. (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying, 6. I {am} the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. {bondage: Heb. servants} 7. Thou shalt have none other gods before me. 8. Thou shalt not make thee {any} graven image, {or} any likeness {of any thing} that {is} in heaven above, or that {is} in the earth beneath, or that {is} in the waters beneath the earth: 9. Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God {am} a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth {generation} of them that hate me, 10. And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments. 11. Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD will not hold {him} guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 12. Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee. 13. Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 14. But the seventh day {is} the sabbath of the LORD thy God: {in it} thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that {is} within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou. 15. And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and {that} the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day. 16. Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 17. Thou shalt not kill. 18. Neither shalt thou commit adultery. 19. Neither shalt thou steal. 20. Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour. 21. Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any {thing} that {is} thy neighbour's. 22. These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me. 23. And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, {even} all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 24. And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth. 25. Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die. {hear: Heb. add to hear} 26. For who {is there of} all flesh, that hath heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we {have}, and lived? 27. Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear {it}, and do {it}. 28. And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken. 29. O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever! 30. Go say to them, Get you into your tents again. 31. But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do {them} in the land which I give them to possess it. 32. Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 33. Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and {that it may be} well with you, and {that} ye may prolong {your} days in the land which ye shall possess. \n",

It's like constantly sharpening your mind, ya know? 8. And you should like, wear them on your hand, and they should be like, those cool headbands in front of your eyes. 9. And make sure to flex those verses on the walls of your crib and at your entrance, fam. 10. Yo, when God finally takes you to the lit land he promised your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where he'll hook you up with dope cities that you didn't even have to build from scratch, 11. And like, houses with mad cool stuff that you didn't even put there, and wells that you didn't even dig, and vineyards and olive trees that you didn't even plant, and when you've eaten and you're totally satisfied; 12. Dude, don't even think about forgetting the LORD, who totally saved you from Egypt and being all enslaved and stuff. (bondage means being like bondmen or servants, just FYI) 13. You gotta show some mad respect for the LORD your God, and be straight up loyal to him, and you can't be using his name like it's just any other word. 14. Don't go chasing after the gods that all the other people are into around you, okay? 15. (Because, like, the LORD your God is totally possessive, ya know?) Don't wanna make the LORD your God super mad at you, or else He'll straight up obliterate you, like, off the face of the earth. 16. Don't even think about testing the Lord your God like you did back in Massah. Seriously, not cool. 17. Make sure you stay on top of the game and follow all the rules and regulations of the LORD your God. Stay true to His teachings and guidelines that He's given you. 18.

And like, dude, when your kid hits you up in the future, sayin' 'Yo, what's the deal with all these testimonies, statutes, and judgments that the LORD our God told us to follow?' 21. So like, tell your kid, dude, we were like slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, but then the LORD totally swooped in and saved us, man. It was legit epic! 22. And God was flexing so hard in Egypt, doing all these crazy cool miracles and stuff to show off his power. He was straight up messing with Pharaoh and his whole crew, right in front of our faces. (BTW, 'sore' means like, majorly intense, just so you know.) 23. And he rescued us from there, so he could bring us to this awesome place and fulfill his promise to our ancestors. 24. God told us to follow these rules, to respect Him, because it's actually for our own benefit. He wants to keep us safe and alive, just like He does today. 25.

Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do {it}; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey. 4. Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God {is} one LORD: 5. And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. 6. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: 7. And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. {teach: Heb. whet, or, sharpen} 8. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. 9. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates. 10. And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not, 11. And houses full of all good {things}, which thou filledst not, and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full; 12. {Then} beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. {bondage: Heb. bondmen or, servants} 13. Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his name. 14. Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which {are} round about you; 15. (For the LORD thy God {is} a jealous God among you) lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth. 16. Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted {him} in Massah. 17. Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee. 18. And thou shalt do {that which is} right and good in the sight of the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, 19. To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken. 20. {And} when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What {mean} the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD our God hath commanded you? {in...: Heb. to morrow} 21. Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand: 22. And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes: {sore: Heb. evil} 23. And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. 24.

So here's what you gotta do, fam: obliterate their altars, wreck their statues, chop down their sacred trees, and set their fancy carved idols on fire. Oh, and don't forget to make sure you burn those pillar thingies too. 6. Bro, listen up! You are like, legit special to the LORD your God. He chose you, like out of all the peeps on earth, to be His own special crew. You guys are on another level, like holy and stuff. 7. The LORD didn't choose you or love you because you had the most peeps. In fact, you were like the underdogs, the fewest of 'em all: 8.

You're gonna totally take out all the people that God hands over to you. No mercy, man. And make sure you don't go worshipping their gods, 'cause that's gonna mess you up big time. 17.

And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, {and} utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them: 3. Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. 4. For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly. 5. But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire. {their images: Heb. their statues, or, pillars} 6. For thou {art} an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that {are} upon the face of the earth. 7.

Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers: {if: Heb. because} 13.

Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle. 15. And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them upon all {them} that hate thee. 16. And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that {will be} a snare unto thee. 17. If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations {are} more than I; how can I dispossess them? 18. Thou shalt not be afraid of them: {but} shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt; 19.

It was, like, a whole vibe to, like, humble you and test you, to see what's really in your heart, whether you'll, like, keep following His commandments or not. 3. And he made you feel small, let you starve, and then sent you manna, a type of food you had never seen before, even your ancestors didn't know about it. He wanted to make you understand that humans need more than just physical bread to survive, they need every single thing that comes from the mouth of the LORD to truly live. 4. Your clothes stayed fresh on you, and your feet didn't get swollen, for like, a whole forty years. 5.

There's also an abundance of olive oil and honey up in here. It's straight up paradise, yo! 9. It's a place where you'll have plenty of bread to munch on, and you won't be missing out on anything. The land is packed with iron rocks and brass can be dug up from the hills. 10.

Who guided you through that huge and intense desert, filled with crazy snakes, poisonous scorpions, and extreme dryness, where there was no water at all; the one who made water gush out from a solid rock; 16. Who was the one hooking you up with manna in the wilderness when your parents didn't even know about it? Yeah, that was to teach you some humility and test you, so you could come out on top in the end. 17. And you're thinking to yourself, like, it's all me and my skills that got me all this money and stuff. 18. But don't forget about the LORD your God, 'cause He's the one who hooks you up with the means to stack that cash, so He can keep His promise to your ancestors, just like He said way back when. 19. If you ever forget about God and start following other gods, serving and worshipping them, just know that I'm warning you right now - that path will lead to your downfall. 20. Just like how the Lord wipes out those other nations, you're gonna get wrecked too, because you refused to listen to God's voice. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 81. All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers. 2. And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, {and} to prove thee, to know what {was} in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments, or no. 3. And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every {word} that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. 4. Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years. 5. Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his son, {so} the LORD thy God chasteneth thee. 6. Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him. 7. For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; 8. A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; {of oil...: Heb. of olive tree of oil} 9. A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not lack any {thing} in it; a land whose stones {are} iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass. 10. When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee. 11. Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this day: 12. Lest {when} thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt {therein}; 13. And {when} thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; 14. Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; 15. Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, {wherein were} fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where {there was} no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; 16. Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end; 17. And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of {mine} hand hath gotten me this wealth. 18. But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for {it is} he that giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as {it is} this day. 19. And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish. 20. As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 91. Listen up, fam: You're about to cross over the Jordan today and take over countries that are bigger and stronger than you, with cities that are massive and fortified up to the sky. 2. These peeps are huge, like giants or something. You've probably heard of them, the Anakims? People say nobody stands a chance against them! 3. Just so you know, today, the LORD your God is the one who goes ahead of you. He's like a fierce fire that obliterates anyone in his path and brings them down right in front of you. That's how you'll kick them out and wipe them out in no time, just like the LORD told you. 4. Don't even think to yourself, once the LORD your God has kicked them out from before you, saying, 'It's because I'm so righteous that the LORD brought me in to take over this land.' Nah, it's actually because these nations are wicked that the LORD is giving them the boot before you. 5. It's not because you're super righteous or have a pure heart that you're gonna take over their land. It's actually because these nations are wicked that the LORD your God is kicking them out and keeping His promise to your ancestors - Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 6. So like, just know that the big man upstairs isn't giving you this awesome land because you're all righteous or anything. Let me tell you, you guys can be stubborn as heck sometimes. 7. Yo, don't forget how you totally ticked off the LORD your God when you were in the wildnerness. Ever since you left Egypt up until now, you've been straight up rebellious against the LORD. 8. So, like, at Horeb, you totally made the LORD mad and stuff, and he was angry enough to, like, destroy you. 9. So, when I went up the mountain to get the stone tablets, you know, the ones with the agreement that the LORD made with you, I stayed up there for like forty days and nights. And get this, I didn't even eat or drink anything during that whole time! 10. So, like, God totally gave me these two stone tablets, right? And He wrote on them with His own finger, like divine calligraphy or whatever. And on these tablets, He wrote down every single word that He spoke to you guys when we were all at the mountain, surrounded by fire, you know, on that assembly day. 11. So like, after 40 days and nights, God hooked me up with these two stone tablets. They were, like, the real deal, the covenant tables. No joke! 12. And God was like, 'Yo, bro, you gotta bounce from here ASAP! Your peeps you rescued from Egypt are totally messed up. They've gone off track real quick and started worshipping some creepy metal statue thingy.' 13. Yo, the LORD came to me and was like, 'Listen up, I've got something to say. I've been observing these peeps, and let me tell you, they are stubborn AF.' 14. Just leave me be, so I can totally wipe them out and erase their existence from this world. And guess what? I'll turn you into a nation that's gonna be even more epic and powerful than they could ever dream of being. 15. So, like, I turned around and came down from the mountain, and the whole mountain was on literal fire: and guess what? I was holding the two tablets of the covenant in my hands, yo! 16. So I saw, and, like, whoa, you totally messed up against the LORD your God. You went and created this emoji-like golden calf, and you, like, totally bailed on following the path that the LORD told you to take. 17. So, I grabbed those two tablets and yeeted them right out of my hands, and smashed 'em in front of y'all. 18. So, I totally hit the ground in front of the LORD, like I did before, for a whole forty days and nights. During that time, I didn't even touch a bite of bread or take a sip of water. It was all because of all the messed up things you guys did, you know, being wicked and getting on the LORD's bad side, making Him super angry. 19. TBH, I was low-key shook by the LORD's rage and intense anger that could have totally wiped you out. But like, NGL, the LORD actually listened to me at that time too, you know? 20. Bruh, God was so mad at Aaron, He was about to destroy him. But yo, I stepped in and prayed for Aaron, like, right then and there. 21. So, like, I totally grabbed the calf you made, the one representing your sin, and straight up burned it with fire. Then I crushed it and ground it down to tiny pieces, like dust. I ended up tossing that dust into the brook that flowed from the mountain. 22. So, like, at Taberah, Massah, and Kibrothhattaavah, you totally made the LORD super angry. 23. So, like, when the LORD was all, 'Yo, peeps, I'm sending you from Kadeshbarnea to claim that dope land I gave you,' you straight up rebelled against His command, not believing Him or listening to His voice. 24. You've been totally disobedient to the LORD ever since I knew you. 25. So, like, I totally prostrated myself before the LORD for a solid forty days and nights, just like I did at the beginning, you know? 'Cause the LORD straight up said He was gonna annihilate y'all. 26. So, like, I hit up the LORD with a prayer and I'm all like, 'Yo, Lord GOD, don't even think about wiping out your peeps and the land that you rescued with your sick greatness. Remember how you flexed and led them out of Egypt with major power moves and stuff. 27. Yo, don't forget about our homies Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don't pay attention to how stubborn, wicked, or sinful these peeps are being right now, yo. 28. So like, imagine if the place where you rescued us from starts saying, 'Dude, the LORD couldn't even bring those peeps into the land He promised them. He must've hated them, so He just brought them out here to totally kill them in the middle of nowhere.' 29. But, like, they're totally your peeps and your chosen fam, that you freed with your epic strength and your sick flexed arm. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 91. Hear, O Israel: Thou {art} to pass over Jordan this day, to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven, 2. A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and {of whom} thou hast heard {say}, Who can stand before the children of Anak! 3. Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God {is} he which goeth over before thee; {as} a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee. 4. Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee. 5. Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 6. Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou {art} a stiffnecked people. 7. Remember, {and} forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD. 8. Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you. 9. When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, {even} the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water: 10. And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them {was written} according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly. 11. And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, {that} the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, {even} the tables of the covenant. 12. And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted {themselves}; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image. 13. Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it {is} a stiffnecked people: 14. Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they. 15. So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant {were} in my two hands. 16. And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, {and} had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you. 17. And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes. 18. And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 19. For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also. 20. And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time. 21. And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, {and} ground {it} very small, {even} until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount. 22. And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath. 23. Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice. 24. Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you. 25. Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down {at the first}; because the LORD had said he would destroy you. 26. I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 27. Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin: 28. Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. 29. Yet they {are} thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 101. Back then, God was like, 'Yo, grab two stone tablets just like the first ones and meet me up on the mountain. Oh, and don't forget to build a wooden ark too.' 2. And I'll totally jot down on those tablets the same words that were on the first tablets you broke, and you gotta stash 'em in the ark. 3. So, like, I crafted this super cool ark out of shittim wood, you know? Then, I carved two stone tablets that were, like, totally identical to the first ones. After that, I went up the mountain, holding the two tablets in my hand. Totally epic, right? 4. So, he jotted down the same 10 rules on the tablets that the LORD had told you guys about when you all gathered at the mountain. It was super intense, like, there was fire and everything. Then, the LORD handed them over to me. 5. So, I like totally turned around and descended from the mount, dude. Then, I placed the tablets in the ark that I crafted, just as the LORD told me to. And guess what? They're still right there, chilling like the LORD said. 6. So the Israelites moved from Beeroth of Jaakan to Mosera. That's where Aaron passed away and was laid to rest. His son Eleazar took over as the priest and carried on his legacy. 7. Then they went to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a place with lots of rivers and water. 8. Back in the day, God picked out the tribe of Levi to handle the holy ark and serve Him directly. They've been blessing people in His name ever since. 9. So, Levi doesn't get any share or land like his brothers. The LORD is his inheritance, just like the LORD your God promised him. 10. So, like, I chilled on the mountain for, like, the same amount of time as before - forty days and nights. And, yo, the LORD totally listened to me again during that time, and He was like, 'Nah fam, I ain't gonna wipe you out.' 11. Then God was like, 'Yo, get up and start walking ahead of the crew so they can enter and own the land that I promised to their ancestors. It's about time they claim what's theirs, ya know?' 12. Yo, Israel, here's what the LORD wants from you: just show some respect to the LORD your God, follow His path, genuinely love Him, and serve the LORD with all your heart and soul. 13. So, like, you gotta follow all the rules and stuff that the LORD gave you today, because it's all for your own good, you know? 14. Yo, listen up! The Lord your God totally owns the whole deal - the heaven, the super fancy heaven, and even the Earth with all the cool stuff in it. 15. God was totally into your ancestors, he really loved them and picked their descendants to be his special people, and that includes you, like, above everyone else, like, even until now. 16. So like, get rid of all that emotional baggage in your heart, and don't be stubborn anymore. 17. Bruh, the LORD your God is the ultimate of all gods, the boss of bosses, straight up amazing, powerful, and intimidating. He doesn't play favorites or take bribes, no cap. 18. He's got the backs of the orphans and widows, and he's all about showing love to the outsiders by hooking them up with good eats and sick outfits. 19. So, like, be cool with strangers and stuff because, ya know, back in the day when your ancestors were living it up in Egypt, they were total strangers too. 20. You gotta have mad respect for the LORD your God; serve Him with everything you got, stick with Him no matter what, and swear by His name. 21. He's like, the one you should totally be praising, and he's your God, you know? He's the one who's like, done all these amazing and, like, mind-blowing things that you've actually seen with your own eyes. 22. Like, your ancestors totally migrated to Egypt with, like, seventy people. And now, the LORD your God has totally made you, like, as many as the stars in the sky. So legit, you're a huge crowd now! \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 101. At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood. 2. And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. 3. And I made an ark {of} shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand. 4. And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me. {commandments: Heb. words} 5. And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me. 6. And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead. 7. From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters. 8. At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day. 9. Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD {is} his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him. 10. And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, {and} the LORD would not destroy thee. {first...: or, former days} 11. And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take {thy} journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them. {take...: Heb. go in journey} 12. And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, 13. To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good? 14. Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens {is} the LORD'S thy God, the earth {also}, with all that therein {is}. 15. Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, {even} you above all people, as {it is} this day. 16. Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked. 17. For the LORD your God {is} God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward: 18. He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. 19. Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 20. Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. 21. He {is} thy praise, and he {is} thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen. 22. Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude. \n",

      "KJV: Deuteronomy 111. Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway. 2. And know ye this day: for {I speak} not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, 3. And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 4. And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and {how} the LORD hath destroyed them unto this day; 5. And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this place; 6. And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the substance that {was} in their possession, in the midst of all Israel: {substance...: or, living substance which followed them} {was...: Heb. was at their feet} 7. But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did. 8. Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to possess it; 9. And that ye may prolong {your} days in the land, which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 10. For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, {is} not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst {it} with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 11. But the land, whither ye go to possess it, {is} a land of hills and valleys, {and} drinketh water of the rain of heaven: 12. A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God {are} always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year. {careth...: Heb. seeketh} 13. And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, 14. That I will give {you} the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 15. And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat and be full. {send: Heb. give} 16. Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 17. And {then} the LORD'S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and {lest} ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you. 18. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes. 19. And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 20. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: 21. That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. 22. For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him; 23. Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves. 24. Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. 25. There shall no man be able to stand before you: {for} the LORD your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you. 26. Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 27. A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I command you this day: 28. And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known. 29. And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. 30. {Are} they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? 31. For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. 32. And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 121. These are the rules and laws that you need to follow in the place that the LORD God of your ancestors will give you to live in, for as long as you're here on Earth. 2. You gotta completely wipe out all the spots where those nations you're taking over worshipped their gods. Like the ones on the tall mountains, the hills, and even under all those leafy trees. (Or, you know, claim as your own) 3. You gotta destroy their altars, break their pillars, and burn their groves to the ground. Oh, and don't forget to smash those carved images of their gods and wipe out any trace of their names from that spot, ya feel me? {overthrow: Hebrew for break down} 4. Don't even think about disrespecting the LORD your God like that. 5. But like, you gotta go to the spot that God's gonna pick from all your tribes to put his name there and stuff. That's where he lives, so that's where you should go and stuff. 6. And you gotta bring all your offerings, sacrifices, tithes, raised-up offerings you made with your hands, promises you made, offerings you gave freely, and the firstborns of your animals over to that place: 7. And there, you'll have a dope feast in front of the LORD, your God. You gotta be pumped about all the awesome stuff you've been crushing, both you and your fam. That's all thanks to the blessings from the LORD, your God. 8. Don't just copy everything we're doing today, thinking whatever you do is cool. 9. Yo fam, you haven't reached the chill vibes and the lit blessings that the LORD your God is hooking you up with yet. 10. When you're crossing the Jordan and settling in the land that the LORD your God's hooking you up with, and when he gives you a break from all those haters coming at you from every direction, so you can live your life without worries; 11. So, there's gonna be this super cool spot that God himself picks out to be all holy and legit. You gotta bring everything I tell you there - your burnt offerings, sacrifices, tithes, and even those awesome promises you make to God. Like, anything and everything you promise to Him, bring it to that epic place! 12. And you shall like totally vibe with the LORD your God, you, and your squad, and your fam, and your homies, and your girls, and the Levite who's chillin' in your hood; 'cause he ain't got no share or property like you do. 13. Yo, listen up! Don't be goin' around offering up your burnt offerings just anywhere you feel like, okay? 14. But, like, in the spot that the LORD picks, within one of your tribes, that's where you gotta bring your burnt offerings, and that's where you gotta follow all my commands, okay? 15. But yo, it's chill if you wanna slay and feast on some meat in all your spots, whatever your heart desires, all good 'cause it's the blessing from the man upstairs, the LORD your God. Whether you're all pure and clean or not, you can still chow down on it, like a full-on feast of venison. 16. Just don't consume blood, it's a no-go. Gotta spill it on the ground like water, no exceptions. 17. Yo, you can't be chowing down on that tithe of corn, wine, oil, or the firstborns of your herds or flocks within your crib. And yo, don't be touching any of them vows you be making, or them freewill offerings and heave offerings you be giving, fam. 18. But like, you gotta eat them in the place that, you know, God chooses, with you, your siblings, your chill servants, and even the Levite dude in your town. And while you're at it, make sure you're hype and happy when you do anything with your hands, like showing love to God, ya know? 19. Yo, make sure you don't abandon the Levite while you're still kickin' it on this planet. (For real, all your days, man.) 20. When God gives you more land, just like He promised you, and you're like, 'Yo, I wanna feast on some meat because my soul is craving it,' then go ahead and eat all the meat your heart desires. 21. If the spot that God picked to bless is too far away from you, you gotta sacrifice some animals from your own farm, just like He told you. Then you can grub on whatever your heart desires right at home! 22. Just like when people eat roebuck and hart, you'll be able to eat them too, whether they're clean or unclean. 23. Just make sure you don't munch on blood, 'cause that's where the real juice is! No mixing life with your food, y'know? Stay strong! 24. Don't grub on it, just pour it out like water on the ground. 25. Don't chow down on it, so you and your squad can be blessed for generations to come, only if you stay on the right path that the big man upstairs sees as legit. 26. Just take your sacred things and vows, and head to the spot that the LORD has picked out, no doubt! 27. And you gotta bring your burnt offerings, like, the meat and the blood and all that, and present it on the altar of the LORD your God. The blood from your sacrifices should be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, and you can totally chow down on the meat. 28. Listen up and pay attention to all these words I'm telling you, so that things go smoothly for you and your fam forever. When you do what's cool and righteous in the eyes of the LORD your God, trust me, it's gonna be lit. 29. Once the Big Man upstairs clears out all the nations that you've gotta deal with and you take over their land and settle down, like totally rockin' it there; (inheritest, like keepin' it in the family, or possessest them, like stakin' your claim) 30. Make sure you don't get caught up trying to imitate those people who are about to be wiped out from your midst. Don't start asking around about their gods, like 'Hey, how did these nations worship their gods? Should I do the same?' 31. Don't even think about doing that to the LORD your God, 'cause all the messed up stuff they've done to their gods—burning their own sons and daughters as sacrifices—yeah, God totally hates all that nasty business. #notcool 32. Whatever I tell you to do, make sure you do it, no adding or subtracting allowed. \n",

These {are} the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth. 2. Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: {possess: or, inherit} 3. And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. {overthrow: Heb. break down} 4. Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God. 5. But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, {even} unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come: 6. And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: 7. And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee. 8. Ye shall not do after all {the things} that we do here this day, every man whatsoever {is} right in his own eyes. 9. For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God giveth you. 10. But {when} ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and {when} he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; 11. Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD: {your choice...: Heb. the choice of your vows} 12. And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that {is} within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you. 13. Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest: 14. But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I command thee. 15. Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart. 16. Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water. 17. Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand: 18. But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that {is} within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto. 19. Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou livest upon the earth. {as long...: Heb. all thy days} 20. When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. 21. If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. 22. Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat {of} them alike. 23. Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood {is} the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh. {be...: Heb. be strong} 24. Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water. 25. Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do {that which is} right in the sight of the LORD. 26. Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose: 27. And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh. 28. Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest {that which is} good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God. 29. When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their land; {succeedest...: Heb. inheritest, or, possessest them} 30.

      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 131. So, like, if there's ever a person who comes up in your squad claiming to be a prophet or some dream guru, and they try to drop some crazy signs or mind-blowing miracles, 2. And if that crazy thing actually happens, like he said it would, telling you to follow some other gods that you've never heard of before and start worshipping them... 3. Don't listen to that prophet or dreamer, fam. The LORD your God is testing you to see if you're truly down for Him, if you love Him with everything you've got in your heart and soul. 4. Yo, make sure you stay on the same wavelength as the LORD your God, and show respect, follow his rules, listen to his guidance, be ready to serve him, and stick with him no matter what. 5. And if someone, whether a prophet or a dreamer, tries to lead {you} astray from the LORD your God, who rescued {you} from Egypt and freed {you} from slavery, they shall be put to death. Their words go against the path the LORD your God commanded {you} to follow, so it is necessary to remove their evil influence from among {you}. 6. Yo, if your bro, your blood sibling, or your own child, or your daughter, or your ride or die spouse, or your homie who's like your soulmate, tries to sneakily convince you to worship other gods that you and your ancestors never even heard of, 7. Like, seriously, don't even think about worshipping any of those gods that other people have around you, whether they're nearby or far away, from one side of the world to the other. We're talking worldwide here, bro! 8. Don't agree with him or listen to him; don't feel sorry for him or spare him, and don't keep his actions a secret: 9. But like, you gotta, like, totally eliminate him; you gotta be the first one to take him out, and then everyone else can join in. 10. You gotta pelt that person with stones until they bite the dust, 'cause they tried to steer you away from the LORD thy God, the one who freed you from Egypt, from the place of enslavement. {bondage: Hebrew term for bondmen} 11. And all of Israel will be like, totally shook and they won't even think about doing any of that super, wicked stuff like you did. 12. So, like, if you ever hear someone in one of your towns that God hooked you up with, saying, 13. Yo, there are these dudes, like, the absolute worst. They straight up left your crew and managed to convince everyone in their city to ditch us and start worshipping random gods that we've never even heard of. Like, seriously, not cool. 14. So, like, you gotta investigate and really look into it, ask lots of questions. And guess what? If you find out that all those messed up things are actually true and for sure happening around you, like, that's just so wrong and disgusting. 15. You gotta totally wreck those peeps in the city, like, with a sword and stuff. Obliterate everything in there, including the people, their stuff, and even their livestock. Sword power, baby! 16. You gotta collect all the loot from that place and pile it up in the middle of the street. Then, you gotta set the whole city on fire, along with all the loot, completely destroying everything, all for the LORD your God. It'll become a massive heap that will never be rebuilt. 17. You gotta make sure you don't hold onto any of that cursed stuff, man. The Lord wants to cool down his anger and show you some love and compassion. He promised your ancestors that he'll make you multiply, so don't mess it up. 18. When you actually listen to what the LORD your God is saying and actually follow all the rules he's giving you today, and actually do what's considered good in the eyes of the LORD your God. \n",

      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 141. Hey, listen up! You guys are like God's awesome kids. So, make sure you don't go cutting yourselves or shaving bald spots between your eyebrows to mourn the dead. Not cool, fam! 2. Because like, you're really special to God, like a vibe that he totally digs. He picked you to be his chosen crew, standing out from all the other nations on this planet. 3. Don't consume anything that's totally disgusting, fam. 4. These are the animals that are totally acceptable for you to munch on: the beef, the fluffy sheep, and the GOAT! 5. Yo, check out these dope animals: the hart, the roebuck, the fallow deer, the wild goat, the pygarg (aka bison), the wild ox, and the chamois. That's what's up! 🦌🐐🦬 6. And every animal that has split hooves and divided claws and chews cud, among all the animals, you can totally have it as food. 7. But like, you gotta stay away from animals that chew their food again and have split hooves, like camels, hares, and conies. They chew the cud, but don't have split hooves, so they're considered unclean for you, ya know? 8. So, like, the pig, it's not cool, because even though it looks all fancy with its divided hoof, it doesn't chew its cud, so it's like unclean and stuff. You're not supposed to eat its meat or even touch its dead body, bro. 9. You can totally munch on all the fishies in the water, but only the ones with fins and scales, okay? 10. You can't eat anything that doesn't have fins and scales, it's considered unclean for you. 11. You can chow down on any fresh bird, fam. 12. But these are the ones you shouldn't eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 13. And the fierce falcon, and the cool AF hawk, and the savage eagle in all its dope variations, 14. And like, every raven looking all slick and cool with its own unique style, 15. And like, the chill owl, the night hawk, the cuckoo, and the hawk and stuff, all in their own unique styles, you know? 16. The tiny owl, the mega owl, and the majestic swan, 17. And like, the pelican, and the cool eagle, and the cormorant, 18. And like, there's the stork, and the heron and its squad, and the lapwing, and even the bat. 19. And, like, every creepy crawly thing that flies is, like, totally uncool according to you. You totally can't eat them, like, ever. 20. You can totally chow down on any cool bird that's considered clean. 21. Yo, don't eat any animals that died on their own. Give that stuff to the homie living in your area so he can chow down, or you can sell it to someone from another land. You gotta remember, we're a special crew chosen by the LORD your God. Oh, and don't cook a baby goat in its own mom's milk. That's a no go. 22. You gotta totally give a tenth of all the stuff you get from planting your seeds each year, like, everything that the field produces. 23. And you gotta flex before the Lord your God, in the spot He chooses to be worshipped, with 10% of your grain, wine, and oil, and the firstborn of your animals; so you'll understand how to always show mad respect to the Lord your God. 24. And if the journey ahead is totally dragging you down, and you're like, 'Ugh, can't even handle it,' or if the destination is mad far away from where you at, where the LORD your God wants to be worshipped, when the LORD your God has blessed you:  25. So, like, take whatever it is and sell it for cash. Put the cash in your hand and head over to the spot that God has picked out. 26. And you can spend that cash on whatever your soul craves, whether it's for some sick oxen, dope sheep, lit wine, or even some strong drinks. Basically, you can get whatever your soul desires. Then, you and your fam can have a feast before the LORD your God and have an absolute blast. It's all about satisfying those cravings, ya know?! 27. And the Levite who is in your town; you should never ditch them; because they don't have any share or inheritance with you. 28. After three years, you gotta bring all that extra cash you made and stash it within your own hood: 29. So like, the Levite, because he doesn't get any land or property with you, and the outsider, and the kid without a dad, and the widow, who are living in your place, they should come and have a meal and be totally full. Then, the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do with your hands. \n",

      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 151. After every seven years, you gotta let it go, man. 2. And here's how it works, fam: If your neighbor owes you something, you gotta let it go.

It's cool if you ask a foreigner to pay you back, but when it comes to your bro, you gotta let it slide, no need to hold onto what's rightfully theirs. 4.

If you see one of your bros who's struggling and broke, living in the same town as you in the land that the LORD your God gave you, don't be all cold-hearted and stingy and refuse to help your poor bro out: 8. But you gotta be generous and help him out, and you should totally lend him enough to cover what he's lacking. 9. Watch out for any wicked thoughts in your heart, saying that the seventh year, the year of release, is coming soon. And don't let your eye be filled with evil against your poor brother, refusing to give him anything. If he cries out to the Lord because of you, it will be counted as a sin against you. 10. You gotta give to him without any regrets, and your heart won't feel bad about it. 'Cause when you give, the LORD your God will hook you up with blessings in everything you do and wherever you put your hands on. 11. Like, poverty is just a persistent thing, man. So, here's the deal: I'm telling you to be super giving to your homies, the ones who are struggling and in need, especially in your own hood. 12. So, like, if your bro, whether a Hebrew dude or a Hebrew chick, ends up being sold to you and becomes your servant for six years, you gotta set them free in the seventh year. No more servitude, man. 13. And when you set him free, don't send him away with nothing: 14. You gotta hook him up big time from your stash, your stash of drip and your stash of lit vibes. Whatever blessings the LORD your God has blessed you with, you gotta share with him. 15. And like, bro, don't forget that you were totally a servant in Egypt, but the LORD your God totally saved you from that. So, I'm telling you today, like, you gotta do this thing, alright? 16. If someone tells you they won't leave you 'cause they're totally into you and your crib, and they're feeling all good with you, here's what you gotta do. 17. So, like, grab a piercing tool and put it through their earlobe, right into the door. That'll make them your servant forever. And yeah, do the same thing for your female servants too. 18. Don't stress when you let him go free, because he's been like a top-notch worker for you, serving you for six years. And trust me, the Big Guy upstairs will totally bless everything you do. 19. Yo, dude, when it comes to the firstborn males of your herd and flock, you gotta set them apart as holy for the Lord your God. Don't use that firstborn bullock for any labor or shave the firstborn sheep, okay? 20. Every year, you gotta feast in the place that God chooses, with your fam, ya know? 21. But if there's anything wrong with it, like if it's broken or messed up in any way, you shouldn't offer it as a sacrifice to God. 22. You gotta chow down on it in your hood: whether you're clean or unclean, everyone can dig in just like a roebuck or a hart. 23. Just don't consume the blood; pour it on the ground like water instead. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 151. At the end of {every} seven years thou shalt make a release. 2. And this {is} the manner of the release: Every creditor that lendeth {ought} unto his neighbour shall release {it}; he shall not exact {it} of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD'S release. {creditor: Heb. master of the lending of his hand} 3. Of a foreigner thou mayest exact {it again}: but {that} which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release; 4. Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee {for} an inheritance to possess it: {Save...: or, To the end that there be no poor among you} 5. Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day. 6. For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee. 7. If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother: 8. But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, {in that} which he wanteth. 9. Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be sin unto thee. {thought: Heb. word} {wicked: Heb. Belial} 10. Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto. 11. For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land. 12. {And} if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee. 13. And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty: 14. Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor, and out of thy winepress: {of that} wherewith the LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. 15. And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day. 16. And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee; 17. Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust {it} through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise. 18. It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant {to thee}, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest. 19. All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep. 20. Thou shalt eat {it} before the LORD thy God year by year in the place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household. 21. And if there be {any} blemish therein, {as if it be} lame, or blind, {or have} any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God. 22. Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean {person shall eat it} alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart. 23. Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 161. Yo, remember to pay attention during the month of Abib and celebrate the passover to honor the LORD your God. 'Cause it was in that month that the LORD your God rescued you from Egypt under the cover of darkness, man. 2. So, like, you gotta make sure to offer the passover sacrifice to the LORD your God, right? Just pick some animals from your flock or herd, and head over to the spot where the LORD wants you to offer it. That's where His name is gonna be, you know. 3. Don't even think about pairing this up with leavened bread, okay? For a solid seven days, you gotta stick to that unleavened bread. We're talking the bread of affliction here, because ya know, when you hightailed it outta Egypt, you did it on a rush. This whole deal is to make sure you never forget the day you made your grand exit from Egypt, and that memory should stick with you as long as you're alive. 4. Make sure you don't have any bread with yeast in it for a whole week, and don't leave any leftover meat from your evening sacrifice until morning. 5. Don't throw a Passover party at your crib, where God gives you the hookup: 6. Yo, when the Lord your God picks a spot to like, establish His name, that's where you gotta offer up the Passover sacrifice. It's gotta go down in the evening, right as the sun is setting, just like when you dipped outta Egypt back in the day. 7. And you'll totally fire up and chow down on it in the spot that the LORD your God picks out: then you'll bounce in the AM and head back to your crib. 8. For six days, you can totally munch on that gluten-free bread, but on the seventh day, it's time to gather up and have a lit celebration for the big man upstairs. No work allowed on that day, fam. #SundayFunday 9. You gotta count seven weeks for yourself, starting from when you first start harvesting the corn, ya know! 10. And you gotta celebrate the vibes of weeks for the LORD your God by offering something dope from your own swag, which you gotta give to the LORD your God, depending on how He's blessed you. Make sure it's enough, ya know? 11. You gotta flex and be lit before the LORD your God, you, and your squad, and your peeps who hold you down, and your peeps who do the dirty work, and the ones who serve in the Lord's house, and even the ones who aren't from your crew, and the ones who don't have a fam, and the ones who lost their bae. All of y'all gotta turn up in the spot where the LORD your God wants to be worshipped. 12. Don't forget how you were once in Egypt, enslaved, bro. Make sure you follow and do all these rules, okay? 13. You gotta celebrate the awesome festival of tabernacles for a whole week, once you've gathered up all your grain and made some killer wine. #HarvestVibes 14. And you should totally vibe and have a lit time at your feast, you, your Main Squad, your fam, your homies, the Levite, the stranger, and those who don't have their pops around, and the widows that are all up in your hood. 15. Yo, for a whole week, you gotta throw down a lit celebration for the LORD your God at the spot He picks out. 'Cause you know what? The LORD your God is gonna shower you with blessings in everything you do, so you better be hyped and definitely have a good time! 16. So basically, three times a year, all you guys gotta show up before God at the spot he picks. It's during the time of the unleavened bread feast, the weeks feast, and the tabernacles feast. And you definitely can't show up empty-handed. 17. Each person should give according to their ability, based on the blessings they've received from the LORD your God. Just give what you can, no pressure or anything. 18. Yo, make sure you appoint some judges and officers at all your entrances, bro. The Almighty is hooking you up with them in every tribe. Their job? To bring down some righteous justice and make fair judgments for the people. 19. Don't be unfair when making decisions; don't play favorites or take bribes. Gifts can cloud the minds of smart peeps and twist the words of the righteous. {words: or, matters} 20. You gotta be all about that justice, like, for real. That's how you gonna live your best life and get that sweet land that the LORD your God is hooking you up with. #blessed #inheritance 21. Don't set up any chill tree spots right next to God's altar, okay? That's a big no-no. 22. Yo, don't even think about making no replica or statue that God straight up despises. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 161. Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night. 2. Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there. 3. Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, {even} the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life. 4. And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days; neither shall there {any thing} of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning. 5.

Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice. 16. Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty: 17.

      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 171. Don't even think about offering any messed up bullock or sheep to the LORD your God. It's like a major no-no, super disgusting to Him. Haha, and don't even try to pull a sneaky move by substituting a goat instead of a sheep, 'cause that won't fly either. 2. If you come across someone in your squad, anywhere in your hood that the LORD your God hooked you up with, whether it's a guy or a girl, and they're doing some mad messed up stuff that goes against what the LORD your God stands for, 3. And, like, totally started following and worshipping other gods, you know? Like, getting all obsessed with the sun, the moon, or any of those celestial things, even though I never told them to do that. 4. So, like, if someone comes up to you and spills the tea, and you hear about it, and you start digging for the facts, and, OMG, it turns out to be true, that some seriously messed up stuff is happening in Israel: 5. So, like, if there's a dude or a chick who did some totally wicked stuff, you gotta bring 'em to the community, ya know? And then, like, everyone grabs stones and throws them at them until, like, they're gone, man. 6. If two or three peeps say it, then the homie who deserves punishment will be put to death, ya feel me? But if it's just one person saying it, they can't decide to whack someone. 7. The witnesses will be the first ones to lay hands on the person to sentence them to death, and then all the people will follow. This way, you'll get rid of the evil in your midst. 8. If you come across a difficult case to judge, whether it's between family members, different arguments, or even physical altercations happening within your community, you should go to the designated location chosen by the LORD your God to resolve the matter. 9. So, like, you gotta go see the priests, you know, the Levites, and also the judge who's in charge at that time, and ask them what's up. They'll totally tell you the verdict and everything. 10. And you gotta do what they tell you in that spot that the LORD chooses, and make sure you follow all their instructions: 11. Listen up, fam! When the law peeps teach you what to do and how to judge, you gotta follow their lead. Don't stray from their instructions, whether it's to the right or the left. 12. If someone acts without respect and refuses to listen to the priest or judge who is serving before the LORD your God, that person will face consequences - they shall be put to death, and evil shall be removed from Israel. 13. And everyone's gonna hear it, be shook, and stop acting all extra. 14. When you finally reach the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and you take ownership of it, and you start living there, and you think to yourself, 'I want a king just like all the other nations around me,' 15. You gotta choose a king that the LORD your God picks. They gotta be one of your own peeps, not a random outsider. 16. But he shouldn't be flexing with horses or make the people go back to Egypt just to flex with more horses. 'Cause the LORD straight up said, 'Y'all ain't going back that way anymore.' 17. He shouldn't like, have a bunch of wives, 'cause like, it can distract him, ya know? And he shouldn't be all obsessed with amassing a ton of money, like silver and gold and stuff. 18. So, once he takes his place as the ruler of his kingdom, he's gotta make himself a dope handwritten copy of this law from the book that the priests, the Levites, got on lock. 19. He should always have it with him and read it every single day so that he can understand how awesome God is and follow all the rules and commands written in it. 20. So he doesn't act all superior and ignore the rules by doing whatever he wants. He's gotta stay on track and not stray to the right or left. This way, he'll have a long reign as king, along with his kids, in the whole area of Israel. \n",

Thou shalt in any wise set {him} king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: {one} from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which {is} not thy brother. 16. But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way. 17. Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. 18. And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of {that which is} before the priests the Levites: 19. And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them: 20.

But, like, if some so-called prophet thinks they can just go around claiming to speak for me, using words I never told them to say or even trying to represent other gods, well, they better watch out because that prophet is gonna face some serious consequences, like, they'll totally perish. 21. And if you're like, okay, how can we tell if the LORD didn't actually say this? 22. If a prophet says something will happen in the name of the LORD, but it doesn't actually happen, then you can be sure that the LORD didn't say it, and the prophet was just speaking without authority.

Yo, make a path for yourself and split up the different areas of the land that the LORD your God is giving you as your inheritance, dividing it into three parts so that any person who accidentally kills someone can have a safe place to escape to. 4. So here's the deal with someone who accidentally kills another person. They can go to a safe place and not get in trouble. It's important to note that this only applies if they had no previous beef with the person they killed, like it was a totally random thing. And by the way, when it says 'yesterday the third day', it basically means recently. Just clearing that up for ya! 5. Imagine this: two dudes head into the woods together to chop down some trees. One of them swings the axe, ready to cut down a tree, but whoops! The head of the axe slips off the handle and accidentally hits his buddy, causing him to die. In this case, the guy who swung the axe has to book it to one of those designated cities to seek refuge and stay alive. (By the way, 'head' in Hebrew means 'iron,' and 'helve' means 'wood,' and 'lighteth upon' means 'findeth'!) 6. Yo, imagine this: if someone accidentally kills another person, they better watch out because the deceased's family might come after them in a fit of anger and take revenge. It could be a long chase, and if they catch up, they might end up killing the accidental killer. However, if it can be proven that there was no pre-existing hatred between them, then the accidental killer shouldn't be put to death. Pretty wild, right? 7. So, like, I'm telling you, you gotta set up three cities just for yourself, okay? 8. And if the Lord, your God, expands your territory just like He promised your ancestors, and grants you all the land He promised to give them; 9. If you stay true to all these rules and actually follow them, which I'm telling you right now, like loving the LORD your God and always walking in His ways, then you'll get three extra cities, in addition to the ones you already have. 10. Make sure no one spills innocent blood in the land that the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance, otherwise you'll be held responsible. 11. But like, if someone totally hates their neighbor and plans to sabotage or attack them, causing serious harm or even death, and then like runs away and hides in one of these cities: (mortally means like, causing loss of life in Hebrew, just FYI) 12. So, like, the oldies from his town will, like, send someone to bring him back and hand him over to the avenger dude, like, so he can, like, meet his demise. 13. You won't be empathetic towards them, but you gotta abolish the burden of innocent blood from Israel, so things will go smoothly for you. 14. Don't mess with your neighbor's property lines, the ones that have been set since forever in the land you're gonna inherit from the LORD your God. It's all gonna be yours, so don't go moving any boundaries. 15. You can't just have one person accusing someone of doing something wrong or sinful. In order for it to be legit, there gotta be at least two or three witnesses who can vouch for what went down. 16. Yo, if someone comes in with fake receipts to snitch on someone and spread false accusations; like, totally not cool, man! 17. So like, these two dudes who are in a disagreement, they're gonna show up in front of God, the priests, and the judges who are around at that time, you know? 18. Yo, the judges gotta do a thorough investigation, like, they really gotta dig deep. And check it out, if the witness ends up being a total liar, spreading false accusations about his own bro... 19. Treat him just like he planned to treat his bro: that's how you get rid of the negativity within your crew. 20. And the people who are still around are gonna hear this and start freaking out, and they won't ever do anything so messed up again with you guys around. 21. And don't have sympathy; it's all about fair play, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 191. When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and in their houses; {succeedest: Heb. inheritest, or, possessest} 2. Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it. 3. Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither. 4. And this {is} the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past; {in...: Heb. from yesterday the third day} 5. As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of those cities, and live: {head: Heb. iron} {helve: Heb. wood} {lighteth...: Heb. findeth} 6. Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he {was} not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past. {slay...: Heb. smite him in life} {in...: Heb. from yesterday the third day} 7. Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee. 8. And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers; 9. If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three: 10. That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee {for} an inheritance, and {so} blood be upon thee. 11. But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these cities: {mortally: Heb. in life} 12. Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 13. Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away {the guilt of} innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee. 14. Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it. 15. One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established. 16. If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him {that which is} wrong; {that...: or, falling away} 17. Then both the men, between whom the controversy {is}, shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in those days; 18. And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, {if} the witness {be} a false witness, {and} hath testified falsely against his brother; 19. Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you. 20. And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you. 21. And thine eye shall not pity; {but} life {shall go} for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 201. Yo, when you out there in a fierce battle against your enemies and you see horses, chariots, and people deep in numbers, don't trip out, fam. God got your back, straight up. He's the one who busted you outta Egypt, so you good to go. 2. When you're getting ready for battle, the priest will come up to you and give you a pep talk, 3. Okay listen up, Israel! Today is the day we go into battle against our enemies, but don't let your hearts waver, don't be afraid or tremble, don't let them intimidate you! 4. Yo, check it: The LORD your God is straight up by your side, ready to throw down and take on your enemies, all for the purpose of saving you. 5. And the guys in charge gotta talk to the peeps, saying, Yo, if there's a dude who just built himself a dope new crib but hasn't thrown down a dedication party for it, he can bounce and head back home. We don't want him getting wrecked in the battle while someone else hypes it up. 6. Bro, imagine you're this guy who has planted a dope vineyard but hasn't even gotten a taste of its fruit yet. If that's you, you better go back home, like ASAP, before you end up dead in battle and some other dude just comes along and enjoys the fruits of your labor. No cap, you gotta protect what's yours, fam. 7. Yo, imagine if a dude gets engaged to a girl but hasn't sealed the deal, y'know? So, if he's about to go to war and hasn't gotten busy with his girl yet, he should just bounce back home and avoid risking his life. 'Cause if he dies in battle, some other dude might swoop in and snatch her away. 8. And the officials will address the people again, saying, if anyone out here is feeling scared or timid, it's totally cool for them to head back home, because we don't want anyone's spirits to drop, you know? We gotta keep the vibes strong for everyone! 9. Once the officers are done talking to the people, they'll appoint leaders for the armies to be in charge of everyone. 10. When you're approaching a city to go to war with it, let them know you come in peace. 11. And if it responds positively and welcomes you, then all the people there will become yours, paying tribute and serving you. 12. And if it refuses to make peace with you and instead starts a conflict, you gotta lay siege to it: 13. And once the LORD your God basically hands it over to you, you gotta like totally attack and defeat every single guy there with your super sharp sword, no kidding: 14. Yo, listen up! When it comes to the ladies, the kiddos, the animals, and everything else in that city, you can totally keep it all for yourself. Yeah, that's right! You're allowed to feast on all the stuff you've taken from your enemies as a tasty reward from the LORD your God. #spoils 15. So this is what you gotta do to all those cities that are, like, super far away from you and aren't part of the same crew as these nations. 16. But like, when you start takin' over those cities that the LORD your God gives you as, like, your inheritance, you gotta make sure you don't leave anyone alive, ya know, like, no one breathin' and stuff. 17. But, like, you gotta totally wipe them out – I'm talkin' the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, alright? 'Cause that's what the LORD your God told ya to do, no questions asked! 18. So, like, don't follow their messed up actions, ya know? They've done all sorts of messed up stuff in the name of their gods. If you start doing the same, it's gonna be a major sin against the big man upstairs, the LORD your God. 19. Yo, when you're sieging a city for a hot minute, trying to conquer it, don't go chopping down the trees with some crazy axe. Those trees can be useful for food, man, so don't cut 'em down just for the sake of your siege. Remember, the trees in the field are like a person's life, they shouldn't be used for your battle tactics. So, don't be ignorant and go chopping them down. 20. Only destroy and cut down trees that you know are not for eating. Build walls against the city that is at war with you until it is defeated. (It will come down.) \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 201. When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, {and} a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God {is} with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 2. And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people, 3. And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them; {faint: Heb. be tender} {tremble: Heb. make haste} 4. For the LORD your God {is} he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you. 5. And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man {is there} that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. 6. And what man {is he} that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not {yet} eaten of it? let him {also} go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it. {eaten...: Heb. made it common} 7. And what man {is there} that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her. 8. And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man {is there that is} fearful and fainthearted? let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's heart faint as well as his heart. {faint: Heb. melt} 9. And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people. {to lead...: Heb. to be in the head of the people} 10. When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it. 11. And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be, {that} all the people {that is} found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee. 12. And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee, then thou shalt besiege it: 13. And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: 14. But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, {even} all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee. {take: Heb. spoil} 15. Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities {which are} very far off from thee, which {are} not of the cities of these nations. 16. But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee {for} an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth: 17. But thou shalt utterly destroy them; {namely}, the Hittites, and the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee: 18. That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God. 19. When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field {is} man's {life}) to employ {them} in the siege: {for the...: or, for, O man, the tree of the field is to be employed in the siege} {to employ...: Heb. to go from before thee} 20. Only the trees which thou knowest that they {be} not trees for meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued. {it...: Heb. it come down} \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 211. If someone's found dead in the land the LORD your God's given you to live in, lying in a field, and nobody knows who did it: 2. So, here's the deal: the older and wiser folks, you know, the elders and judges, they're gonna show up and do a little measuring thing. Yep, they're gonna measure all the cities around the place where someone got themselves killed. 3. So, like, if a city is near to where a dude got killed, the older peeps from that city gotta bring a young cow that hasn't done any work or pulled any heavy stuff, ya know? 4. Yo, so the old folks from that city gotta take the cow down to this rugged valley, where no one's ever farmed or planted anything, and straight up chop its neck off right there in the valley, yo: 5. So, the Levite priests will step up, because God chose them to serve Him and give blessings in His name. They'll also be the ones to settle any disputes or issues. 6. And all the older folks in that town, who live near the dead person, gotta do a hand cleanse over the cow that gets its head chopped off in the valley: 7. And they'll be like, yo, we didn't even do this, man. Like, our hands are clean, bro, we didn't spill this blood. And wait up, we never even saw this go down, swear. 8. Yo, LORD, be chill and show mercy to your squad, Israel, ya know? You've totally saved them and stuff, so don't be blaming innocent blood on them. Forgive 'em and everything will be cool, ya dig? {in the midst, etc: in their midst} 9. By doing what's right and not shedding innocent blood, you'll rid yourself of guiltiness. It's all about pleasing the LORD, ya know? 10. When you're about to go into battle against your enemies, and God has given you victory and captured them, 11. Yo, imagine you peep a fine girl among the captives and you're feeling those relationship vibes, like you wanna make her your wifey, you know what I'm saying? 12. So you bring her to your place, and she gotta buzz her head and get her nails did; ya know, make 'em nice and neat. 13. And she'll take off her TikTok merch, and stay at your crib, and cry about her fam for a whole month. And then you can slide into her DMs, become her bae, and she'll be your wifey. 14. If you're not vibing with her, you gotta let her do her thing and go wherever she wants. But you definitely can't treat her like an item to be sold or make a profit off of her, 'cause you've disrespected her. 15. If a dude's got two wives, one he's really into and the other he's not feeling so much, and they both have kids for him - the one he's into and the one he's not - and if the firstborn son is from the wife he's not so into... 16. So, like, when this person gives his sons their inheritance, he can't favor the son of his favorite wife over the son of his not-so-favorite wife, even if the less favorite son is the oldest. 17. But, like, he's gotta, you know, legit recognize the son of the one he's not really feeling as much, like, as his firstborn. And, like, he's gotta hook him up with, like, double the goods and stuff, because, you know, the hater-son is, like, the one who gets the party started and, like, represents the strength and all. So, yeah, the right of the firstborn is totally his, you know, like, no question. 18. Imagine if there's this dude who has, like, a seriously stubborn and rebellious son. This kid straight up refuses to listen to his dad or his mom. And get this, even when they try to discipline him, he still won't pay them any attention. Like, no way, bro. 19. So, like, his parents will grab him and take him to the elders of his city, you know? And they'll bring him to the gate of his place, for real. 20. And they'll be like, yo, elders of his city, listen up. Our son here is all stubborn and rebellious, straight up refusing to listen to us. Dude's a total binge-eater and heavy drinker, no cap. 21. Then all the guys from his city gotta like, throw stones at him until he dies, man. That's how you're gonna like, get rid of evil in your midst. And when all of Israel hears about it, they're gonna be like, super scared, I swear. 22. And if a dude did something really messed up that deserves death, and he's gotta be executed, you should hang him on a tree, ya know: 23. Don't let his body hang on the tree overnight; make sure you bury him the same day. (Because someone who's hanged is considered cursed by God.) This is so your land, which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, doesn't get defiled. \n",

And it shall be, {that} the city {which is} next unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been wrought with, {and} which hath not drawn in the yoke; 4. And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley: 5.

Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them. {unto thy people of: Heb. in the midst, etc} 9.

Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; {pare: or, suffer to grow: Heb. make, or, dress} 13. And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. 14. And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her. 15. If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have born him children, {both} the beloved and the hated; and {if} the firstborn son be hers that was hated: 16. Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit {that} which he hath, {that} he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated, {which is indeed} the firstborn: 17. But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated {for} the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he {is} the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn {is} his. {that...: Heb. that is found with him} 18. If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and {that}, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: 19. Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 20. And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son {is} stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; {he is} a glutton, and a drunkard. 21. And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear. 22. And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree: 23. His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged {is} accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee {for} an inheritance. {accursed...: Heb. the curse of God} \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 221. Don't pretend you didn't notice when your bro's ox or sheep wander off. Make sure you bring them back to him, no matter what. 2. And if your bro isn't nearby or you don't know him, then you gotta bring it to your own crib, and it'll chill with you until your bro comes looking for it, and then you gotta give it back to him. 3. Treat your friend's stuff the same way you'd treat his pet; also, do the same with his clothes and anything he's lost that you found. Don't be shady and try to hide it,  just do what's right! 4. You should never just ignore your bro's donkey or ox when they stumble on the road. Instead, lend a hand and help them get back on their feet. 5. Girls shouldn't wear stuff that's for guys, and guys shouldn't rock girls' clothes. It's not cool with the big guy upstairs. 6. Bruh, if you come across a bird's nest while you're out and about, whether it's in a tree or on the ground, with some baby birds or eggs, and the momma bird is chilling on top of them, you can't snatch up the whole fam: 7. But, like, make sure to let the momma go, and, like, take care of her babies; so that everything goes well for you, and so you can have a long life, you know? 8. When you're building a new crib, make sure to put a safety barrier around your rooftop, so nobody accidentally falls and gets hurt. Safety first, fam! 9. Don't mix up the seeds when planting your vineyard, or else the produce from your seeds and your vineyard will be ruined. 10. Don't mix'n'match your power duo - an ox and a donkey on the same grind. 11. Don't mix different fabrics in your outfit, like wool and linen. 12. You should put fringes on all four corners of your clothes, which you use to cover yourself. (quarters: meaning wings in Hebrew) 13. If a dude gets a girl and they do the deed, but then ends up hating her, 14. And like, spread rumors about her and shame her by saying that I slept with her and she wasn't a virgin when I did: 15. So like, the girl's dad and mom will, you know, show the proof of her virginity to the leaders of the city at the hangout spot, ya feel? 16. So, like, the girl's dad will go to the elders and be like, 'Yo, I totally gave my daughter to this guy as his wife, but he's, like, totally hating on her, you know?' 17. And, like, he totally accused her and was all like, 'I didn't find your daughter a virgin, but look, here's proof of her purity.' And they have to show the cloth to the city elders, you know? 18. So, like, the leaders of that city gotta grab that dude and teach him a lesson in front of everyone; 19. They're gonna make him pay a hefty fine of a hundred silver coins and give them to the girl's dad, all because he spread nasty rumors about an innocent Israeli girl. And guess what? He's stuck being married to her forever. No divorces allowed, yo! 20. But if this is legit and the signs of being a virgin aren't there for the girl: 21. So they'll bring the girl to her dad's crib, and the dudes from her squad will throw rocks at her until she's out. She messed up big time by sleeping around in her own house, causing some major drama in Israel. That's how you get rid of the bad vibes, yo! 22. If a dude hooks up with a married chick, they both gotta go, like, both the guy and the girl. That's how you get rid of the bad stuff in Israel, man. 23. Okay, so picture this: If a girl, who's like totally pure and hasn't even dated anyone yet, is engaged to this guy, and then another dude comes along and sleeps with her in the city... 24. So, like, you gotta take them both outside to the gate of the city and throw rocks at them until they die, ya know? The girl didn't cry out for help in the city and the guy, well, he messed around with his neighbor's wife. That's how you kick evil outta your community, bro. 25. But yo, if a dude comes across a girl who's already promised to be someone's bae in the field and he straight up forces himself on her and does the deed, then that dude who did the dirt is the only one who's gonna face the ultimate consequence - death. (By 'force' they mean like strong hold, you know? Respect boundaries and consent, y'all.) 26. But you don't need to do anything to the girl; she hasn't done anything deserving of punishment. It's like when someone attacks their neighbor and kills them, it's a similar situation here: 27. So, like, he totally found her in the field, and the girl he was engaged to started freaking out and cried for help, but there was literally no one around to save her. 28. If a dude finds a girl who's a total virgin and not engaged, and they hook up and someone catches them, 29. So, like, if a guy hooks up with this girl, he's gotta pay her dad fifty silver coins and then they gotta get married, ya feel? 'Cause he, like, deflowered her or whatever, so he can't just dump her later on. Gotta stick it out forever, man. 30.

The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so {are} abomination unto the LORD thy God. 6. If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on the ground, {whether they be} young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young: 7. {But} thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to thee; that it may be well with thee, and {that} thou mayest prolong {thy} days. 8. When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from thence. 9. Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled. {fruit of thy seed: Heb. fulness of the seed} 10. Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together. 11. Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, {as} of woollen and linen together. 12. Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest {thyself}. {quarters: Heb. wings} 13. If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, 14. And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid: 15. Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth {the tokens of} the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate: 16. And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; 17. And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech {against her}, saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these {are the tokens of} my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city. 18. And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him; 19. And they shall amerce him in an hundred {shekels} of silver, and give {them} unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days. 20. But if this thing be true, {and the tokens of} virginity be not found for the damsel: 21. Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you. 22. If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, {both} the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel. 23. If a damsel {that is} a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; 24. Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, {being} in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you. 25. But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die: {force: or, take strong hold of} 26. But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; {there is} in the damsel no sin {worthy} of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so {is} this matter: 27. For he found her in the field, {and} the betrothed damsel cried, and {there was} none to save her. 28. If a man find a damsel {that is} a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 29. Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty {shekels} of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days. 30. A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his father's skirt. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 231. Anyone who's got his junk damaged or lost can't be part of the LORD's crew. 2. A person born out of wedlock won't be part of the Lord's crew; not even for ten generations will they be part of the Lord's squad. 3. No Ammonite or Moabite is allowed in the Lord's squad; they're totally banned for ten generations, no exceptions. 4. They didn't give you food or water when you left Egypt, and they even paid Balaam from Mesopotamia to curse you. 5. But God didn't listen to Balaam tho, instead, God flipped the curse and made it a blessing for you because God loves you, like, so much. 6. Don't be vibin' with their peace or success, like, forever and ever, man. Hope you understand, it's all about that good life, y'know? 7. Don't hate on an Edomite; they're your fam: don't hate on an Egyptian either, 'cause you were once a stranger in their crib. 8. The kids born from them will get into the community of the LORD by the time they're third gen. 9. When the squad rides out against your haters, make sure to stay away from all wickedness. 10. If someone in your crew isn't feeling fresh due to nighttime struggles, tell them to step outside the squad. They can't kick it with us in the crew anymore. 11. But listen up, when the sun starts setting, he's gotta freshen up with some water: and once it's totally dark, he can head back to the camp, you know. Like, it's all about staying clean and following the rules, ya feel? 12. You gotta have a spot outside the crew where you can kick it like a boss: 13. You should always have a tool with your weapon. When nature calls, use it to dig a hole, and then make sure to cover up what you leave behind. 14. Because the righteous God is hanging with you, right in the middle of your crew, to protect you and crush your enemies. So, make sure your squad stays pure, so that He won't dip and block you. Oh, and just a heads up, 'unclean thing' means anything sketchy. 15. Don't snitch and turn in a runaway servant to their master, bro: 16. He's gonna chill with you, like, right here in whatever spot he wants, like one of your entrances or whatever. You gotta be cool to him, no oppressing allowed. 17. There shouldn't be any girl doing shady stuff or guys doing sketchy things among the Israelites. {shady stuff: or, sketchy things} 18. Don't bring the money you get from a hook-up or the cash you made from shady business into the place where you worship God. It's totally disgusting to Him. 19. Don't charge interest when you lend money or food or anything else to your bro. Seriously, no need to take advantage of them like that, it's not cool. 20. You can totally loan money with interest to someone you don't really know, but when it comes to your own peeps, no interest allowed. This way, the Lord your God will totally bless everything you put your hands to in the land you're about to inherit, ya know? 21. When you make a promise to the LORD your God, don't be lazy to keep your word, because the LORD your God will definitely hold you accountable. Breaking your promise would be considered wrong. 22. But, like, if you decide not to make a vow, it's totally fine, no guilt trip or anything. 23. Whatever you say, you gotta follow through, like a voluntary flex, keeping the promises you made to the LORD your God, that you straight up spoke out loud. 24. When you go to your friend's vineyard, you can totally munch on grapes as much as you want. But make sure you don't take any home with you, okay? 25. When you find yourself in your neighbor's field of growing crops, it's cool to grab some of the corn with your hand, but you can't go all 'slice and dice' with a sickle on your neighbor's crops. \n",

An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever: 4. Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee. 5. Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee. 6. Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever. {prosperity: Heb. good} 7. Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he {is} thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land. 8. The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the LORD in their third generation. 9. When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing. 10. If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp: 11. But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash {himself} with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp {again}. {cometh...: Heb. turneth toward} 12.

Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee: 16. He shall dwell with thee, {even} among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him. {liketh...: Heb. is good for him} 17. There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel. {whore: or, sodomitess} 18. Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these {are} abomination unto the LORD thy God. 19. Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury: 20. Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it. 21. When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee. 22. But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. 23. That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; {even} a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth. 24. When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put {any} in thy vessel. 25. When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 241. If a guy gets married and then realizes he isn't feeling it with his wife anymore because he found out something that bothers him about her, he can write her a formal breakup letter, give it to her, and kick her out of the house. 2.

Or like, if the husband later, like, dies, who she was married to and stuff. 4. If a guy breaks up with his ex-wife, he can't just get back together with her, 'cause that's messed up and totally goes against what God wants. Don't ruin the land that God gave you by doing something wrong like that. 5. If a dude marries a new girl, he can't go off to war or be tied up with work. He gets a whole year to chill at home and make his wife happy. Nothing can stop him from doing that. 6. Yo, nobody should be out here taking someone's grind equipment as collateral, whether it's the lower one or the upper one. That's straight-up taking away their whole livelihood. 7. If someone gets caught stealing one of their own peeps from the Israel fam and tries to make cash off them or sells them, that thief's gotta face consequences - like straight up death. That's how we keep bad vibes outta here. 8. Yo, listen up, this is important. When it comes to dealing with leprosy, be super careful and pay close attention. Do everything the priests, the Levites, teach you and follow their instructions exactly as I told them. It's crucial to stick to it, okay? 9. Yo, don't forget how the LORD your God handled Miriam while y'all were bouncing out of Egypt. 10. If you lend something to your bro, don't go barging into their crib to grab their collateral. Don't be all up in their business, ya feel? 11. You gotta stay outside, and when you lend something to someone, they gotta bring the collat outside to you. 12. And if the person is broke, you're not allowed to keep their stuff overnight: 13. Yo, like, if someone loans you something, you gotta give it back by sundown so they can sleep in their own stuff and bless you. That's straight up righteous in the eyes of the LORD your God. 14.

Parents won't be punished for their kids' actions, and kids won't be punished for their parents' actions. Each person is responsible for their own mistakes and will face the consequences themselves. 17. Don't mess with the rights of the outsider or the parentless.

Leave them for the outsider, the orphan, and the widow. {go...: Heb. bough it after thee} 21. When you pick the grapes from your vineyard, don't go over it again to get every last one.

      "KJV: Deuteronomy 261. And it shall be, when thou {art} come in unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee {for} an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein; 2. That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put {it} in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name there. 3. And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us. 4. And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God. 5. And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to perish {was} my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous: 6. And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage: 7. And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression: 8. And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders: 9. And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, {even} a land that floweth with milk and honey. 10. And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God: 11. And thou shalt rejoice in every good {thing} which the LORD thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that {is} among you. 12. When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year, {which is} the year of tithing, and hast given {it} unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled; 13. Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of {mine} house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten {them}: 14. I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away {ought} thereof for {any} unclean {use}, nor given {ought} thereof for the dead: {but} I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, {and} have done according to all that thou hast commanded me. 15. Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 16. This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. 17. Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice: 18. And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as he hath promised thee, and that {thou} shouldest keep all his commandments; 19. And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken. \n",

God's gonna make the rain in your land dry and dusty, it's gonna come down from above and keep on going until you're totally wrecked. 25. God will let you get defeated by your enemies. You'll go out to fight them confidently, but end up running away in seven different directions. And you'll be scattered all over the world, no kingdom spared. {removed: Hebrew word meaning to be driven away} 26.

The LORD will totally wreck you with madness, blindness, and a major mind-blowing shock to your heart. 29. You'll be totally lost, like trying to find something in the dark without any clue. You won't find success in your endeavors, and you'll be continuously taken advantage of and left with nothing, without anyone to help you out. 30. You're gonna get engaged to a girl, but some other guy will sleep with her. You'll build a house, but won't even live in it. You'll plant a vineyard, but won't get to enjoy its grapes. {gather...: That means you won't get to enjoy it, just like a regular meal.} 31. Your ox will be killed right in front of you, but you won't get to have a bite. Your donkey will be snatched away from you, and you won't get it back. Your sheep will be handed over to your enemies, and there won't be anyone to save them. They won't come back to you, no chance. 32.

The LORD will take you and the king you appoint to a nation that you and your ancestors aren't familiar with. There, you'll end up worshiping other gods, made of wood and stone. 37. And you're gonna go viral, become a trending meme, and a major shade-throwing legend, in all the places the Big Man upstairs takes you. 38. You gotta plant a ton of seed in the field, but you'll end up with only a little bit, 'cause those locusts gonna munch it all up! 39. You gotta start planting those vineyards, and taking care of them, but you won't get to sip that wine or collect those grapes. Those annoying worms are gonna feast on them instead. 40. You're gonna have olive trees all over your land, but don't even think about using the oil for yourself. Your olives need to drop their fruit, no selfishness allowed. 41. You'll have kids, but you won't get to see them grow up 'cause they're gonna be taken away and put into captivity. They won't exactly be yours anymore. 42. The locusts are gonna totally snack on all your trees and munch on the fruit from your land. Like, they're gonna be all up in it, devouring everything. 43. That random person in your squad will become hella popular, and you gonna be mad unpopular. 44. You'll borrow from them but they won't borrow from you. They'll be in charge and you'll be playing second fiddle. 45. And bro, like all these bad vibes are gonna hit you hard, like they'll chase after you and catch up to you, until you're totally wrecked. It's all because you didn't listen to the voice of the LORD your God and follow his rules and stuff that he told you to do. 46. They will be like a sign and a total mind-blow for you, and for your descendants like, forever and ever. 47. Because you didn't vibe with the LORD your God, full of happiness and excitement, for all the awesome stuff He gave you; 48. So basically, you're gonna end up being under the control of your enemies that the LORD will send your way. You'll be dealing with hunger, thirst, lack of clothes, and basically not having anything you need. And to top it off, you'll have this heavy burden on your shoulders until you're completely wiped out. 49. Yo, the LORD's about to bring a whole nation to come at you from hella far away, like an eagle that be zoomin' through the sky real fast. And get this, their language gonna be totally alien to you, like you won't understand a word they say. (FYI: 'understand' actually means 'hear' in Hebrew.) 50. A totally intimidating nation, they won't care about senior citizens and won't show any mercy to the young ones. 51. And he's gonna devour all your livestock and crops until you're totally wrecked. There won't be any corn, wine, oil, or even milk from your cows or sheep left. He's gonna annihilate it all. 52. And he'll totally surround you, dude, at every entrance, until your fancy walls crumble down. You know, the ones you relied on to keep you safe in your whole land. He's gonna besiege all your entrances, dude, all across your land that the LORD your God gave you. 53. And you'll have to consume the offspring of your own flesh, the meat from your sons and daughters that the LORD your God has provided, during times of warfare and extreme difficulties when your enemies try to overpower you. {body: Hebrew: belly} 54. When a dude who's all sensitive and stuff, like super soft and delicate, starts giving his bro the stink eye and being mean to his wifey and even their kiddos, the ones he's gonna leave behind... Yeah, things are not looking good. 55. So he won't have to resort to eating his own children because he'll be completely desperate during the siege, when your enemies bring you to your knees in every city. 56. The sensitive and fragile woman among you, who's afraid to even step on the ground because she's so dainty and gentle, will give her husband, her son, and her daughter the stink eye. 57. And she will eat her own babies and afterbirth, because of the desperate situation when the enemy puts you under siege and causes you great distress. 58. If you don't follow all the rules written in this book, so you can show respect to this awesome and intimidating name, THE LORD THY GOD; 59. Then God's gonna bring some crazy plagues upon you and your offspring, like seriously gnarly ones that last a long time and make you super sick. 60. And on top of that, you're gonna get hit with all the diseases from Egypt that you were so scared of, and they're gonna stick to you, like, forever. 61. And God will bring upon you all sorts of sickness and plagues that are not even mentioned in this law until you are completely wiped out. 62. And y'all gonna be seriously outnumbered, even though you used to be as lit as the stars in the sky! It's all because you straight up refused to listen to the Almighty himself, the LORD your God. 63. And so, it's gonna go down like this: just like the LORD was all hyped up to do good things for you and help you grow, now He's gonna be hyped up to wipe you out and bring you down. You're gonna get kicked out of the land you're trying to claim. 64. God's gonna like totally spread you out all over the world, from one side to the other. And you're gonna end up worshiping these other gods made of wood and stone, who your ancestors never even knew, dude. 65. And you won't catch a break among these nations, your feet won't find any peace. Instead, the LORD will make your heart race, your vision weak, and your mind filled with sorrow. 66. And your life will be filled with uncertainty; you'll be constantly worried day and night, with no guarantee of your safety: 67. When morning comes, you'll be like 'Ugh, I wish it was already night!' and when night falls, you'll be like Mann, I wish it was already morning!' because you'll be scared out of your mind and the things you'll witness will be straight up terrifying. 68. God's gonna take you back to Egypt in some ships, just like I told you before, and once you're there, you'll never see your homeland again. Get ready to be sold as slaves to your enemies, and good luck finding anyone who'll save you. \n",

And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save {thee}. 30. Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof. {gather...: Heb. profane, or, use it as common meat} 31.

All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume. {consume: or, possess} 43. The stranger that {is} within thee shall get up above thee very high; and thou shalt come down very low. 44. He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail. 45. Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee: 46. And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy seed for ever. 47. Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all {things}; 48. Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all {things}: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee. 49. The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the earth, {as swift} as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand; {understand: Heb. hear} 50. A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old, nor shew favour to the young: {of fierce...: Heb. strong of face} 51. And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land, until thou be destroyed: which {also} shall not leave thee {either} corn, wine, or oil, {or} the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee. 52. And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given thee. 53. And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee: {body: Heb. belly} 54. {So that} the man {that is} tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave: 55. So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates. 56. The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter, 57. And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of all {things} secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. {young one: Heb. afterbirth} 58. If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD; 59. Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, {even} great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance. 60. Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. 61. Also every sickness, and every plague, which {is} not written in the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed. {bring: Heb. cause to ascend} 62. And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy God. 63. And it shall come to pass, {that} as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it. 64. And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, {even} wood and stone. 65. And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: 66. And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: 67. In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. 68. And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy {you}. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 291. Yo, listen up! These words right here, they're all about the covenant that the LORD gave to Moses for the Israelite peeps in Moab. It's like, a super important deal, right? It's the real deal, apart from the one made back in Horeb, you feel me? 2. So Moses gathered all of Israel and was like, 'Listen up guys! Y'all saw firsthand all the epic stuff that the Lord pulled off in Egypt, wrecking Pharaoh and his whole crew, and taking over the whole land and everything! It was wild, dude! Like, no joke. 3. Okay, listen up fam! You've witnessed some epic trials that have tested your faith, along with mind-blowing signs and miracles, no cap! 4. But, like, God hasn't given you the ability to truly understand, see, or hear what's real up until now. 5. I've totally guided you for, like, 40 years in this wild journey. And dude, your clothes didn't even get worn out, and your kicks stayed fresh on your feet the whole time. 6. You haven't even had bread or sipped on wine or any hard drinks, just so you can recognize that I'm the LORD your God. 7. So, when we arrived at this spot, Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, decided to come and fight us. And guess what? We totally crushed them! 8. So, like, we totally snagged their land and were, like, 'Yo, Reubenites, Gadites, and half of Manasseh, this is gonna be your spot now, for real.' 9. So, like, make sure you totally stick to the terms of this covenant and actually do what it says. That way, you'll totally succeed and thrive in everything you do. 10. Today, all of you are here in front of the LORD your God - the leaders of your groups, the wise ones, and those in charge, along with all the guys from Israel. 11. Your squad, your bae, and the new peeps you got in your crew, from the one who chops your firewood to the one who grabs your drink: 12. It's like, you gotta make this tight agreement with the LORD your God, and like, get all oath-y and stuff, 'cause the LORD your God is totally down to make this pact with you today. {enter: It means pass, FYI} 13. So that you could be his chosen crew today, and he can be your ultimate squad goals just like he promised your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. So legit, right? 14. I'm not just making this covenant and promise with you, fam; it's for everyone too, you feel me? 15. But with the squad that's right here with us today, before the LORD our God, and also with those who aren't present with us today: 16. So, like, you all know how we were living in Egypt for a while, right? And, like, how we had to go through all these other countries along the way? 17. And y'all have peeped the straight up whack stuff they worshiped, like wood and stone statues, even silver and gold. Can you believe they actually thought that junk was divine? Smh 🙄 18. Yo, listen up, fam! We don't want any of y'all, whether you're a guy, girl, part of a crew, or reppin' a whole tribe, to be out here strayin' from the Almighty, our God. Don't even think about worshipin' the gods that these other nations are into. We ain't tryna have any toxic vibes or negativity takin' root among us, ya feel me? 19. And when he hears this curse, he thinks to himself, saying, I'll be fine, even if I keep following my own stubborn desires and pursue pleasure: {stubbornness: or, stubbornness} {drunkenness...: Hebrew: the drunk to the thirsty} 20. The Big Guy Upstairs won't cut him any slack, in fact, he's gonna be real ticked off and jealous at that dude. All the bad stuff promised in this book's gonna hit him hard, and his name's gonna be erased from this whole heaven deal. 21. And the LORD will single him out for bad luck from all the tribes of Israel, in line with all the curses written in this book of the law: {are: Heb. is} 22. And when the future fam and the random peeps from distant places peep the messed up things happening in that land and all the sicknesses the LORD brought upon it, they gonna be like, 'Daaaang, that's rough!' 23. Yo, the whole land there is totally messed up - we're talking brimstone, salt, and fire. It's like a barren wasteland, no crops, no grass, nada. Just like when God destroyed Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim in a fit of anger and wrath, you know? 24. Bruh, all the countries gonna be like, Why the Lord be doin' this to the land? What's up with all this intense anger? 25. So people will be like, 'Yo, it's because they straight up ditched the agreement their ancestors made with the LORD God when he brought them out of Egypt.' 26. Because they went and started stanning other gods, totally simping for them. These gods were like total strangers to them, like, they didn't have any connections or anything. God was like, 'Yo, I didn't even offer those gods to them, like, no part of them whatsoever.' 27. But God was really mad at this place and decided to make it go through all the awful stuff mentioned in this book: 28. Then God, like, totally got fed up with them and straight-up kicked them out of their land, all furious and raging with intense anger. He literally tossed them into another place, just like, you know, how things are these days. 29. God keeps the secret stuff to Himself, but He shares what we need to know with us and our generation forever, so we can live by His law. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 291. These {are} the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb. 2. And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all his land; 3. The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great miracles: 4. Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, unto this day. 5. And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot. 6. Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that ye might know that I {am} the LORD your God. 7. And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them: 8. And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. 9. Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may prosper in all that ye do. 10. Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, {with} all the men of Israel, 11. Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that {is} in thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water: 12. That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day: {enter: Heb. pass} 13. That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and {that} he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 14. Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; 15. But with {him} that standeth here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with {him} that {is} not here with us this day: 16. (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came through the nations which ye passed by; 17. And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which {were} among them:) {idols: Heb. dungy gods} 18. Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go {and} serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; {gall: or, a poisonous herb: Heb. rosh} 19. And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: {imagination: or, stubbornness} {drunkenness...: Heb. the drunken to the thirsty} 20. The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven. 21. And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law: {are: Heb. is} 22. So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it; {which...: Heb. wherewith the LORD hath made it sick} 23. {And that} the whole land thereof {is} brimstone, and salt, {and} burning, {that} it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 24. Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this land? what {meaneth} the heat of this great anger? 25. Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: 26. For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and {whom} he had not given unto them: {whom he...: or, who had not given to them any portion} {given: Heb. divided} 27. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book: 28. And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as {it is} this day. 29. The secret {things belong} unto the LORD our God: but those {things which are} revealed {belong} unto us and to our children for ever, that {we} may do all the words of this law. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 301.

If you do that, you'll totally thrive and grow, and God will bless you big time in the place you're headed to own! 17. If you stop listening and start following other paths, like worshiping other gods, you're gonna be off track. 18. Listen up fam, I gotta drop some knowledge on you. If you keep acting like this, you're seriously gonna mess things up and your time in this place is gonna be cut short. You know, that land you're about to head into after crossing the Jordan? Yeah, it's not gonna last long if you keep up with this behavior, just sayin'. 19. Yo, listen up! I wanna make something crystal clear here, so pay attention.

      "KJV: Deuteronomy 301. And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call {them} to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee, 2. And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul; 3. That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee. 4. If {any} of thine be driven out unto the outmost {parts} of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee: 5. And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers. 6. And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live. 7. And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee. 8. And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day. 9. And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers: 10. If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, {and} if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. 11. For this commandment which I command thee this day, it {is} not hidden from thee, neither {is} it far off. 12. It {is} not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 13. Neither {is} it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 14. But the word {is} very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it. 15. See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; 16. In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it. 17. But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 18. I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, {and that} ye shall not prolong {your} days upon the land, whither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it. 19. I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, {that} I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: 20. That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, {and} that thou mayest obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he {is} thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 311. So Moses went and started dropping these words to all of Israel. 2. So, like, I'm 120 years old today and I'm totally not able to go in and out anymore, you know? The LORD also told me that I can't cross the Jordan River, like, at all. 3. Your God, the LORD, will totally wreck those nations for you, and you'll totally take over their land. Joshua will lead the way, just like the LORD promised. 4. God's gonna treat them the same way He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and their land, which He totally wrecked. 5. And God will totally let them have it, so you can unleash your power and wreck them just like I commanded you to do, fam. 6. Stay confident and fearless, don't stress about them: 'cause the LORD your God, He's the one rollin' by your side; He won't dip out on you, or leave you hangin'. 7. So Moses hit up Joshua, and straight up told him in front of everyone in Israel, 'Yo, be hella strong and brave, 'cause you gotta roll with this squad to the land that the LORD promised to our ancestors, and you gonna help them claim it.' 8. Yo, the LORD, He's the one who's always got your back, you know? He's got your front, too - always leading the way. He's always gonna be right there with you, never gonna ditch ya or let you down. So, don't stress, don't be freaking out, just stay strong and keep moving forward. 9. So Moses wrote down these rules and gave them to the priests who were from the family of Levi. They were the ones in charge of carrying the sacred chest which held the agreement between God and his people. Moses also gave the rules to all the respected leaders of Israel. 10. So Moses was like, 'Listen up, guys. Every seven years, when it's time for the big year of release and the feast of tabernacles, 11. When all of Israel gathers before the LORD your God at the spot they pick, you gotta read this law out loud for everyone to hear. 12. Gather everybody - dudes, chicks, kids, and even those outsiders chillin' in your hood. We gotta get them all in one place so they can hear this important stuff, learn from it, and respect the LORD your God. It's key that they follow all the rules given in this law, no skipping out. 13. And so that their kids, who don't have a clue, can hear and learn to respect the LORD your God as long as you're living in the land you're gonna take over after crossing the Jordan. 14. Yo, Moses, listen up! The big man upstairs just told me that your time's almost up and you're about to kick the bucket. So here's the deal: grab Joshua and head over to the meeting spot in the tabernacle. God's got something important to say to him. Moses and Joshua did exactly that and showed up at the tabernacle. 15. So, God showed up in the tabernacle as this cool cloud pillar thing, just chillin' right by the entrance. No biggie. 16. Yo, Moses, listen up. You're gonna rest with your ancestors, and these people are gonna peep the other gods in the land they wander in. They're gonna ditch me and break the deal I made with 'em. #Betrayed 17. On that day, I'll get seriously ticked off at them. I'll ditch them and disappear, turning my back on them. They'll be totally screwed, facing a ton of bad stuff and problems. And they'll be all like, 'Dude, aren't we in deep because our God totally ditched us?' 18. And I'm totally gonna ghost them on that day for all the messed up things they did by ditching me for other gods. 19. So, like, write this dope song, you know? And make sure to teach it to all the kids of Israel, man! Get them to sing along and share it with others. This song will totally be a way for me to call out the children of Israel, you feel me? 20. So, like, when I finally get them to this rad land I promised their ancestors, full of epic stuff like milk and honey, and they've had their fill, they're gonna get all up in serving other gods, disrespecting me, and straight-up breaking our covenant. 21. And it's gonna happen, when they go through a whole bunch of bad stuff and tough times, this song is gonna call them out and be like, 'I told you so'; they won't be able to forget it, even their kids will know it. I know exactly what they're thinking and planning, even before I bring them into the promised land like I promised. 22. So Moses wrote this lit song on the same day and dropped some knowledge to the children of Israel. 23. Then God told Joshua, son of Nun, to be strong and brave, because he was the one who would lead the Israelites into the land that He promised them. And God promised to be there with Joshua every step of the way. 24. So, like, when Moses finished writing down all the words of the law in a book, it was totally a done deal, ya know? 25. Moses told the Levites, who were carrying the sacred ark of the Lord's covenant, this: 26. Yo, grab this lit book of the law and slide it into the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, you know? It's gotta be there to, like, testify against you. 27. Like, I totally get that you guys are rebellious and stubborn. But seriously, check it out: even though I'm still alive and kicking today, you've already been so rebellious towards the LORD. Can you imagine how much worse it's gonna get after I'm gone? 28. Yo, bring all the OGs and the squad leaders from your tribes to me, 'cause I gotta drop some knowledge in their ears and make heaven and earth bear witness to what I'm 'bout to say. 29. Cuz I know that once I'm gone, y'all are gonna totally mess things up and stray from the path I've laid out for ya. And guess what? Bad stuff is gonna happen to you in the future. Why? 'Cause you're gonna go and anger the Big Guy up there with all the messed up things you're gonna do. 30. So Moses like, totally dropped some sick rhymes in front of the whole Israel crew, spittin' the lyrics of this epic song, keepin' it going 'til the very end. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 311. And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. 2. And he said unto them, I {am} an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 3. The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, {and} he will destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: {and} Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said. 4. And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed. 5. And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you. 6. Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD thy God, he {it is} that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. 7. And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it. 8. And the LORD, he {it is} that doth go before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed. 9. And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel. 10. And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of {every} seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, 11. When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their hearing. 12. Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy stranger that {is} within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law: 13. And {that} their children, which have not known {any thing}, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it. 14. And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation. 15. And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle. 16. And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go {to be} among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them. {sleep: Heb. lie down} 17. Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God {is} not among us? {befall: Heb. find} 18. And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods. 19. Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel. 20. For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant. 21. And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I sware. {against: Heb. before} {go...: Heb. do} 22. Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel. 23. And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee. 24. And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, 25. That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying, 26. Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee. 27. For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death? 28. Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them. 29. For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt {yourselves}, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands. 30. And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 321. Listen up, yo heavens, I got something to say! Earth, open your ears and catch the words coming from my mouth. 2. My teachings will be like refreshing rain, my words will flow like gentle dew, spreading like a light drizzle on delicate plants and nourishing the grass with gentle showers. 3. Yo, I'm boutta hype up the name of the LORD, so give mad props to our God. He's straight up amazing, fam. 4. He's like the ultimate boss, his work is flawless: everything he does is fair and righteous. He's a totally real God, there's no shady stuff or mistakes with him, he's just straight-up righteous. 5. Yo, they messed themselves up big time. They don't have the same vibes as his squad. They're a messed up and twisted generation. They got themselves into some shady stuff. 6. Seriously, are you really gonna disrespect the LORD like that, bro? He's totally your OG, the one who's got your back. Like, he's the one who brought you into this world, made you who you are and got you all settled in, you know? 7. Yo, take a sec to rewind the clock and think about the good ol' days. Hit up your pops and he'll fill you in, or consult the OGs and they'll drop some knowledge on you. #Wisdom 8. Back in the day when the big guy upstairs divided up the world for everyone to claim their piece, he made sure to separate all the different peeps out there, basing it on how many of the chill dudes and dudettes from Israel there were. 9. The Lord's got a special bond with his people, like Jacob is his main crew. It's like they're tight like a cord, you know? 10. He like, totally found him in this dry and barren wasteland, out there where it's all like, howling and stuff. And you know what? He didn't just leave him there, man! He guided him, taught him, and protected him like he was super important, you know, like the apple of his eye. {led: or, compassed} 11. Just like when an eagle shakes up her cozy nest, hovers over her adorable little ones, extends her wings wide, scoops them up, and carries them gently on her wings: 12. So, like, the LORD totally took the lead, and there was like, no other God hanging with him. 13. He gave him a prime spot on the earth to flex, where he could feast on the finest crops. He hooked him up with sweet honey straight from the solid rock and fresh oil from the tough flinty rock. 14. You had the best dairy products like butter from cows, milk from sheep, and the juiciest fat from lambs and rams of the fancy Bashan breed. Plus, you had goats and the finest wheat. And let's not forget the purest wine made from grapes - you drank it all! 15. But Jeshurun got way too comfortable and started acting all entitled: he got super big, super self-absorbed, and totally neglected God who brought him up and didn't value the Rock who saved him. 16. They made him jealous by worshipping other gods, which made him furious with their disgusting acts. 17. They were worshipping demons instead of God—following after unfamiliar gods, trendy ones that just popped up—who your ancestors never even considered fearing. 18. You're totally forgetting about the OG who brought you into existence and straight-up neglecting the Creator who made you, man. SMH. 19. And when the LORD saw that, He was totally disgusted because of the rude behavior of His kids, both sons and daughters. He was like, 'Ugh, seriously?' 20. And he was like, I'm gonna ghost them and see how things turn out for them, 'cause honestly, they're such a stubborn and unfaithful bunch of peeps, like they ain't got no trust in them at all, ya know? 21. They got me all jealous over something that ain't even God; they totally ticked me off with their useless stuff. So now, I'm gonna make them jealous by giving attention to people who don't even matter, and I'll really get under their skin by using a bunch of foolish individuals. 22. My anger is like a raging fire that won't stop burning, it will even reach the deepest depths of the underworld! It will completely devour the earth and everything on it, even scorching the very foundations of the mighty mountains! 23. I'm gonna  unleash some serious chaos on them; I'll target them like  an expert archer with my arrows. 24. They'll be absolutely famished, scorched by scorching heat and utterly destroyed: I'll even unleash wild animal teeth upon them, along with venomous snakes that crawl in the dust. (heat: Hebrew for coals) 25. Like, there's gonna be this totally scary sword attack from the outside and lots of fear from the inside. It's gonna mess up both the young dudes and girls, even little babies and old peeps. It's gonna be so intense, man. 26. I was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna send them to all the ends of the earth, erase any memory of them from everyone's minds.' 27. If it weren't for the fact that I'm scared of the haters, worried they might start acting all weird and claim that they're the ones in control, like, trying to take credit for everything while denying that God's behind it all. Like, seriously, they better recognize that it's all from the Most High! 28. Dude, seriously, they're a nation that's clueless and lacks any kind of wisdom or understanding, you know? 29. If only they were woke and actually got it, like, if they could just take a moment to reflect on how everything's gonna turn out for them in the end! 30. How can one person take on a thousand opponents, and two people defeat ten thousand enemies, unless their squad leader had their back, and the LORD had trapped their foes? 31. Their vibe ain't like ours, not even our haters can deny it. 32. Their vine is like the sketchy vines of Sodom and the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes taste like extreme bitterness, and their clusters are seriously sour. It's even worse than your average vine, tbh. 33. Their wine is like the ultimate gamer fuel and, bro, it's as deadly as a dragon's breath and the toxic bite of a venomous snake. 34. Ayo, ain't this stash for real kept with me, all locked up and guarded among my precious things? 35. Vengeance is mine, and payback is coming their way; they're gonna slip up real soon. The day of their downfall is right around the corner, and the consequences are gonna catch up to them real quick. 36. God is gonna judge his people and show compassion to his servants when he sees that they're powerless and there's no one left to help. 37. And he'll be like, 'Where tf are their gods, the ones they used to trust so much? Like, seriously, where's their solid rock now?' 38. Who had the privilege of feasting on the best part of their sacrifices and enjoying their finest wine? Let them step up and lend you a hand, providing you with support and a safe space. 39. Yo, listen up fam, realize that it's me - straight up, no cap. Ain't no other deity rollin' with me. I got the power to take lives or give 'em, to cause pain or bring healing. Ain't nobody out there who can save you from my grip, ya feel me? 40. Because, like, I'm totally raising my hand to the heavens and declaring that I'll be around forever, no cap. 41. Yo, if I sharpen my lit sword and grip it tight, you know I'm gonna serve some sweet justice. I'll totally get back at my enemies and show some love to those who straight up hate me. 42. I'll totally make my arrows soaked in blood, and my sword will totally chow down on flesh; and it's gonna be because of all the bloodshed and the people I've captured. Revenge on our enemies has been happening right from the start, no doubt. 43. Yo, nations! Get hyped with his squad cuz he's gonna make things right. He's gonna bring justice for his loyal crew and lay the smackdown on his enemies. Plus, he'll show mad love to his homeland and his peeps. Let's celebrate, fam! 🙌 44. So Moses showed up and dropped this sick song for everyone to vibe with, him and his bro Hoshea, aka Joshua. 45. So Moses finished talking to all of Israel with these words: 46. Yo, listen up! Pay close attention to everything I'm about to say. It's super important. Make sure you pass it on to your kids and tell them to follow every single word of this law, no exceptions. 47. This is actually pretty important for you, like it's your whole life we're talking about. By following this, you'll secure a long and fulfilling stay in the land you're about to conquer across the Jordan. 48. And God was like, yo Moses, this right here be a message for you today, you feel me? 49. Yo, head up to this lit mountain called Abarim, more specifically Mount Nebo. It's in Moab, across from Jericho. Check out the dope land of Canaan, I'm giving it to the children of Israel as their new crib. 50. And when it's your time to climb that mountain, you'll pass away and be united with your peeps, just like how Aaron, your bro, kicked the bucket on Mount Hor and joined his squad: 51. Yo, you messed up big time when you went against me with the Israelite crew at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. You totally didn't give me the respect I deserve when we were chilling with the rest of the Israelite squad. {Meribah-Kadesh: or, there was some major drama at Kadesh} 52. But listen up, you'll catch a glimpse of the land, but you won't actually get to go there, it's for the children of Israel only. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 321. Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. 2. My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass: 3. Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God. 4. {He is} the Rock, his work {is} perfect: for all his ways {are} judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right {is} he. 5. They have corrupted themselves, their spot {is} not {the spot} of his children: {they are} a perverse and crooked generation. {They have...: Heb. He hath corrupted to himself} {their...: or, that they are not his children, that is their blot} 6. Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? {is} not he thy father {that} hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee? 7. Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee. {many...: Heb. generation and generation} 8. When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel. 9. For the LORD'S portion {is} his people; Jacob {is} the lot of his inheritance. {lot: Heb. cord} 10. He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. {led: or, compassed} 11. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: 12. {So} the LORD alone did lead him, and {there was} no strange god with him. 13. He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; 14. Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape. 15. But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered {with fatness}; then he forsook God {which} made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. 16. They provoked him to jealousy with strange {gods}, with abominations provoked they him to anger. 17. They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new {gods that} came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. {not to...: or, which were not God} 18. Of the Rock {that} begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee. 19. And when the LORD saw {it}, he abhorred {them}, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. {abhorred: or, despised} 20. And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end {shall be}: for they {are} a very froward generation, children in whom {is} no faith. 21. They have moved me to jealousy with {that which is} not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with {those which are} not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. 22. For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. {shall burn: or, hath burned} {shall consume: or, hath consumed} 23. I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them. 24. {They shall be} burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. {heat: Heb. coals} 25. The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling {also} with the man of gray hairs. {within: Heb. from the chambers} {destroy: Heb. bereave} 26. I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men: 27. Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, {and} lest they should say, Our hand {is} high, and the LORD hath not done all this. {Our...: or, Our high hand, and not the LORD hath done} 28. For they {are} a nation void of counsel, neither {is there any} understanding in them. 29. O that they were wise, {that} they understood this, {that} they would consider their latter end! 30. How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up? 31. For their rock {is} not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves {being} judges. 32. For their vine {is} of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes {are} grapes of gall, their clusters {are} bitter: {of the vine: or, worse than the vine} 33. Their wine {is} the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps. 34. {Is} not this laid up in store with me, {and} sealed up among my treasures? 35. To me {belongeth} vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in {due} time: for the day of their calamity {is} at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. 36. For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that {their} power is gone, and {there is} none shut up, or left. {power: Heb. hand} 37. And he shall say, Where {are} their gods, {their} rock in whom they trusted, 38. Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, {and} drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, {and} be your protection. {your...: Heb. an hiding for you} 39. See now that I, {even} I, {am} he, and {there is} no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither {is there any} that can deliver out of my hand. 40. For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. 41. If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. 42. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; {and that} with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. 43. Rejoice, O ye nations, {with} his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, {and} to his people. {Rejoice...: or, Praise his people, ye nations: or, Sing ye} 44. And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. {Hoshea: or, Joshua} 45. And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel: 46. And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. 47. For it {is} not a vain thing for you; because it {is} your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong {your} days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it. 48. And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, 49. Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, {unto} mount Nebo, which {is} in the land of Moab, that {is} over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession: 50. And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people: 51. Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel. {Meribah-Kadesh: or, strife at Kadesh} 52. Yet thou shalt see the land before {thee}; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel. \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 331. So, like, Moses, the dude chosen by God, gave this sick blessing to the Israelites before he kicked the bucket. 2. So he's like, God came down straight outta Sinai, and rolled through Seir all the way to them. He was shining bright from mount Paran and came with a massive squad of saints - we're talkin' ten thousand strong! And get this, he was carryin' a badass fire law in his right hand for those peeps. 3. Like, he was totally into the people! All his awesome followers are, like, in your control. They all sat at your feet and, like, soaked up your words, you know? 4. Moses was all like, 'Yo, peeps, he said we gotta follow this law, you know, the one that's passed down to us from Jacob's crew.' 5. And he was like the ultimate ruler in Jeshurun, when all the cool leaders of the people and the squads of Israel came together. 6. May Reuben prosper and thrive, and may his squad be lit. 7. So this is the awesome blessing for Judah: like, listen up, God, to Judah's voice and bring him back to his peeps. Make sure he's got everything he needs to handle life like a boss. And, you know, be his ultimate backup against all the haters. 8. And about Levi, it goes like, 'Yo, make sure your Thummim and Urim stay lit with your main holy one, that you straight up tested at Massah and straight up clashed with at the waters of Meribah; 9. He straight up lied to his parents, didn't even recognize his own siblings, or know his own kids. All because he was all about following your commands and staying true to your agreement. 10. They're gonna teach Jacob all about your rules, and Israel will learn all about your laws. They'll even offer you incense and sacrifices on your altar. Let them do their thing! 11. God, bless his hustle and give props to his grind. Wipe out any haters and enemies who try to mess with him, making sure they never bounce back. 12. Regarding Benjamin, God's got mad love for him. He's gonna chill in total safety, with God having his back 24/7. It's like he's gonna make his crib right between God's shoulders. 13. And about Joseph, God blesses his land with incredible things from the sky, like the refreshing dew and the mysterious depths below. 14. And, like, thank You for the awesome produce that the sun brings, and, ya know, for all the cool stuff that the moon puts out, like, whoa! 15. And for the epic vibes of those OG mountains, and for the straight fire treasures of the solid hills, 16. And for all the awesome stuff on earth and everything in it, and for the vibes of the one who lived in the bush: let the good blessings fall upon Joseph's head, and on the top of the head of the dude who got separated from his bros. 17. His swag is on point, like the freshest bull in the game, and his drip is unreal, like those unicorn horns. With them, he'll flex on the entire world and gather his crew from every corner. They're the squad of Ephraim, counting in the tens of thousands, and the squad of Manasseh, rocking in the thousands. (Note: The Hebrew word for 'unicorns' means 'one-horned animal.') 18. And for Zebulun, he said, Yo Zebulun, be stoked when you're out and about; and Issachar, get cozy in your tents. 19. They gonna gather everyone up on the mountain, and there, they gonna make righteous sacrifices: cuz they gonna reap the rewards of the bountiful seas and the hidden treasures in the sand. 20. And about Gad, he said, So rad is the dude who expands Gad's horizons! He lives like a boss lion, tearing through challenges with his crown on his head. 21. And he made sure to secure his own position first, because he deserved a special place as a leader. He came together with the leaders of the people, and he carried out the justice of the LORD and his judgments with Israel. 22. And about Dan, he said, Dan is like a fierce young lion, ready to pounce from Bashan. 23. Yo, listen up, Naphtali! God's showing you love and pouring blessings on you. Take charge of the west and the south, fam. 24. And about Asher, he said, Asher's gonna be totally blessed with lots of kids; everyone's gonna be cool with him, and he's gonna be swimming in luxury. 25. Your kicks will be made of dope iron and brass; and just like your days, your strength will always be on fleek. Under your kicks, that is. 26. No one can compare to the God of Jeshurun, who rides through the heavens to come to your aid and shows His greatness in the sky. 27. God is, like, always there for you, providing a safe space and having your back with those never-ending support. And guess what? He'll totally kick out any haters trying to mess with you and be like, 'Bye, Felicia!'. Boom! 28. Israel will be secure and live in peace: the source of Jacob will bless them with abundant harvest and prosperity; even the skies will provide refreshing blessings. 29. Yo, Israel, you're totally blessed! There's no one else out there like you, a people saved by the LORD, your ultimate protector and the one who gives you mad strength! All your enemies will straight up be exposed as liars, and you'll totally dominate their turf. #CrushedIt \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 331. And this {is} the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. 2. And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand {went} a fiery law for them. {a fiery...: Heb. a fire of law} 3. Yea, he loved the people; all his saints {are} in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; {every one} shall receive of thy words. 4. Moses commanded us a law, {even} the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob. 5. And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people {and} the tribes of Israel were gathered together. 6. Let Reuben live, and not die; and let {not} his men be few. 7. And this {is the blessing} of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help {to him} from his enemies. 8. And of Levi he said, {Let} thy Thummim and thy Urim {be} with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, {and with} whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; 9. Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. 10. They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. {They shall teach: or, Let them teach} {they shall put: or, let them put} {before...: Heb. at thy nose} 11. Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. 12. {And} of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; {and the LORD} shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders. 13. And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD {be} his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath, 14. And for the precious fruits {brought forth} by the sun, and for the precious things put forth by the moon, {put: Heb. thrust} {moon: Heb. moons} 15. And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills, 16. And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and {for} the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let {the blessing} come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him {that was} separated from his brethren. 17. His glory {is like} the firstling of his bullock, and his horns {are like} the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they {are} the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they {are} the thousands of Manasseh. {unicorns: Heb. an unicorn} 18. And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents. 19. They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck {of} the abundance of the seas, and {of} treasures hid in the sand. 20. And of Gad he said, Blessed {be} he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head. 21. And he provided the first part for himself, because there, {in} a portion of the lawgiver, {was he} seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel. {seated: Heb. cieled} 22. And of Dan he said, Dan {is} a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan. 23. And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south. 24. And of Asher he said, {Let} Asher {be} blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil. 25. Thy shoes {shall be} iron and brass; and as thy days, {so shall} thy strength {be}. {Thy shoes: or, Under thy shoes} 26. {There is} none like unto the God of Jeshurun, {who} rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky. 27. The eternal God {is thy} refuge, and underneath {are} the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee; and shall say, Destroy {them}. 28. Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob {shall be} upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew. 29. Happy {art} thou, O Israel: who {is} like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who {is} the sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places. {found...: or, subdued} \n",
      "Gen Z: Deuteronomy 341. So Moses headed up from the Moab area to Mount Nebo, to the tippy-top of Pisgah, which is right across from Jericho. And the LORD gave him a sweet view of all the land from Gilead to Dan, you know, that Pisgah hill. 2. And like, all of Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, all the way to the super cool sea, 3. And, like, the south part, and the cool open land near Jericho, which is, like, the city with tons of palm trees, all the way to this place called Zoar. 4. God was like, 'Yo listen up, this is the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I gave you a sneak peek with your own eyes, but you ain't gonna get to go there.' 5. And Moses, the ultimate servant of the LORD, passed away in the Moab area, just as the LORD had foretold. 6. So, like, he buried him in this valley in Moab, right across from Bethpeor, you know? But, like, no one's got a clue where exactly the grave is even till now. 7. Moses passed away at the age of 120, but his vision remained sharp and his strength never weakened. 8. And the Israelites were super sad for Moses in the chill plains of Moab for a whole thirty days, man. But eventually, the crying and mourning for Moses came to an end. No more tears, bro. 9. Joshua, who was Nun's son, was really smart and wise because Moses had given him his blessing. The people of Israel listened to Joshua and followed God's instructions, just like Moses told them to. 10. And there hasn't been a single prophet in Israel as legendary as Moses, who was like besties with the LORD, they knew each other inside out, 11. Like, the LORD totally pulled off all these amazing miracles and stuff in Egypt, specifically to show Pharaoh and his peeps just how powerful He is, no joke. It was a total spectacle for all the Egyptians to witness, from the insane plagues to mind-blowing wonders - they couldn't deny His divine power, man. 12. And through all that epic power, and all the intense awe that Moses displayed in front of all Israel. \n",
      "KJV: Deuteronomy 341. And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that {is} over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, {Pisgah: or, the hill} 2. And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, 3. And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar. 4. And the LORD said unto him, This {is} the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see {it} with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither. 5. So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. 6. And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day. 7. And Moses {was} an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. {natural...: Heb. moisture} {abated: Heb. fled} 8. And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping {and} mourning for Moses were ended. 9. And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses. 10. And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, 11. In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 12. And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 11. So, like, after Moses, the true servant of the LORD, died, the LORD had a chat with Joshua, the son of Nun, who used to be Moses' right-hand guy, and here's what He said, 2. Yo fam, Moses, my homie, he's passed on. So now, it's time for you to step up and lead the way. Gather everyone and let's cross over the Jordan river to the land that I'm gifting to the children of Israel, ya feel me? 3. I promise you, wherever you set foot, I'm giving it to you just like I told Moses. 4. Yo, you gonna have this whole crazy big area, starting from the wilderness and Lebanon to the mighty Euphrates River, extending all the way to the land of the Hittites, and even reaching the rad great sea where the sun sets. It's gonna be your dope coast, bro. 5. No one will ever be able to come against you throughout your life, just like how I was with Moses, I'll be with you too. I won't let you down or abandon you. 6. Stay strong and confident, because it's up to you to divide the land among these people as their inheritance. I promised their ancestors that I would give them this land. 7. Just be strong and super brave, yo, and make sure you follow all the rules that Moses, my servant, told you about. Don't swerve to the right or left, like, stay on track! Then you'll be successful wherever you go, like killin' it in life, you know? 8. Keep this rulebook on your tongue all the time and ponder over it day and night, so that you can follow everything written in it. By doing so, you'll find success and prosper in whatever you do. 9. Like, haven't I told you? Just be strong and confident, don't be scared or freaked out at all. 'Cause the LORD your God will totally be with you wherever you go, no matter what! 10. So Joshua was like, 'Hey, officers of the people, listen up!' 11. Yo, go tell everyone in the squad to get ready and stock up on food. In three days, we're crossing over the Jordan to claim the land that God promised us. It's all ours to own, bro! 12. So Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, saying, 13. Yo, don't forget what Moses, the servant of the LORD, told ya! He was all like, 'The LORD your God has totally hooked you up with rest and this sick land, man.' 14. So, like, all your wives, kids, and even your farm animals, they get to stay in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan river. But you guys, the strong and courageous ones, gotta cross over before your fellow peeps, all organized and ready to fight, and lend 'em a hand. {marshalled by five: Hebrew for, you know, all organized and stuff} 15. Until the LORD has let your squad finally chillax, just like how He's let you all, and they've also snagged the area that the LORD your God is hooking them up with, then you can bounce back to your own territory and have a blast there. It's the same one that Moses, the LORD's ride-or-die servant, gave you on the side of the Jordan River where the sun rises. 16. And they responded to Joshua, like, 'Dude, whatever you tell us to do, we're totally down for it. And wherever you want us to go, we're totally there.' 17. We totally listened to Moses and we'll totally listen to you too, as long as the LORD your God is on your side, just like he was with Moses! 18. If someone decides to go against what you say and refuses to listen to your instructions, they will face serious consequences, even death. But don't worry, stay confident and brave in the face of challenges. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 11. Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying, 2. Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, {even} to the children of Israel. 3. Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses. 4. From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast. 5. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, {so} I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. 6. Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them. {unto this...: or, thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land, etc} 7. Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it {to} the right hand or {to} the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest. {prosper: or, do wisely} 8. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. {have...: or, do wisely} 9. Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God {is} with thee whithersoever thou goest. 10. Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 11. Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it. 12. And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying, 13. Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land. 14. Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them; {armed: Heb. marshalled by five} 15. Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as {he hath given} you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising. 16. And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go. 17. According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses. 18. Whosoever {he be} that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 21. So Joshua, the son of Nun, decided to send two undercover dudes from Shittim to Jericho to, you know, scope out the land. They ended up chilling in a prostitute's crib called Rahab's place. 2. So, the king of Jericho was informed that some dudes from Israel snuck in here last night to check out the land. 3. So the king of Jericho hit up Rahab and was like, 'Yo, bring out those dudes who rolled up to your crib. They're here to scope out the whole area.' 4. So the woman grabbed the two guys and hid them. She was like, 'Yo, these dudes showed up at my place, but I had no clue where they came from, man.' 5. So, like, when the gate was about to close and it got all dark and stuff, the dudes went out. I have no idea where they went, but chase after them real fast, 'cause you'll totally catch up to them! 6. So, she like totally led them to the rooftop and hid them with these stacks of flax that she had carefully arranged up there. 7. So the guys chased after them all the way to the Jordan River crossing, and as soon as those guys were outta there, they locked the gate. 8. And before they settled in, she went up to the roof to chill with them; 9. And she said to the guys, I know that the LORD hooked you up with this land, and y'all got us shook. All the people living here are straight-up melting with fear because of you. 10. So, like, check it out, dudes. We've been hearing all about how the LORD totally made the water in the Red Sea disappear when you peeps were making your way out of Egypt. And, like, let's not forget about how you completely crushed those two kings of the Amorites, Sihon and Og, who were chilling on the other side of the Jordan River. Epic destruction, man! 11. And once we had heard all this, we were shook to the core. No one had any bravery left in them because of you. It's because the LORD your God, he's the real deal up in heaven and down on earth. 12. Okay, listen up! Can you do me a favor and promise me, like, swear it by the LORD? You know, because I've been pretty cool to you. So, I'm just asking if you could also be cool to my family, ya know, show them some love and give me a clear sign that you're down with it! 13. Yo, promise to keep my parents, siblings, and everything they own safe, and save us from any danger or death. 14. And the guys were like, hey, your secrets are safe with us. We promise that once we conquer the land, we'll totally be cool and honest with you. Trust us, we got your back. #Loyalty 15. So she, like, totally lowered them down using a rope through the window since her crib was on the city wall and she lived on the wall. 16. She was like, 'Yo, head to the mountain ASAP so you don't run into those chasers. Chill there for three days until they bounce, then you can dip.' 17. And the guys were like, 'Yo, we ain't gonna take no blame for that oath you made us swear.' 18. Yo, when we finally enter the land, make sure you tie this sick red thread in the window where you let us down. Then, gather your fam - your dad, mom, siblings, and everyone in your dad's crib - all under one roof. Eazy peazy lemon squeezy. 19. Yo, listen up! If anyone leaves your crib and gets hurt out on the streets, it's on them - we ain't responsible! But if they chill with you at home and something happens, we'll take the blame, man, no problem! 20. And if you spill the tea on our business, we won't hold you to that promise you made us. 21. She was like, 'Okay, if you say so.' Then she let them go and they left. And she tied a red string in the window. 22. So they went to the mountain and stayed there for three days, until the people chasing them went back. The pursuers searched everywhere, but couldn't find them. 23. So like, those two dudes came back from the mountain, and they went down and crossed over, and they found Joshua, you know, Nun's son, and they spilled all the tea about what went down. 24. And they were like, dude, Joshua, you won't believe it! The LORD totally handed over all the land to us. I mean, seriously, all the people living there are freaking out because of us. They're literally melting with fear, bro! {faint: in Hebrew, it means melt} \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 21. And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged there. {sent: or, had sent} {lodged: Heb. lay} 2. And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country. 3. And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country. 4. And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they {were}: 5. And it came to pass {about the time} of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them. 6. But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof. 7. And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate. 8. And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof; 9. And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. {faint: Heb. melt} 10. For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that {were} on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed. 11. And as soon as we had heard {these things}, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he {is} God in heaven above, and in earth beneath. {did there...: Heb. rose up} 12. Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token: 13. And {that} ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death. 14. And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee. {for...: Heb. instead of you to die} 15. Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house {was} upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall. 16. And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way. 17. And the men said unto her, We {will be} blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear. 18. Behold, {when} we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee. {bring: Heb. gather} 19. And it shall be, {that} whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood {shall be} upon his head, and we {will be} guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood {shall be} on our head, if {any} hand be upon him. 20. And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear. 21. And she said, According unto your words, so {be} it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window. 22. And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought {them} throughout all the way, but found {them} not. 23. So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all {things} that befell them: 24. And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us. {faint: Heb. melt} \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 31. So, Joshua woke up super early in the morning and they left Shittim and arrived at the Jordan River. It was him and all the Israelite crew chilling there, getting ready to cross over. 2. So, like, three days later, the officers like totally went through the whole crew; 3. So they were like, 'Yo peeps, listen up. When you see the box thingy called the ark of the special agreement with the LORD your God, and the priests who are Levites carrying it, you gotta bounce from where you're at and follow that thing.' 4. But keep a distance, about two thousand units away from it, and don't get too close, so that you know which way to go. This is new territory for you, so you haven't been here before. (It's like, totally recent, not long back.) 5. Joshua was like, yo people! Get yourselves ready, cuz tomorrow the LORD is gonna do some epic stuff among you! 6. So Joshua was like, 'Hey, priests, grab the ark of the covenant and lead the way for the peeps.' And the priests did just that, lifting up the ark and going ahead of the people. 7. And God was like, 'Yo, Joshua, today I'm gonna make you look super awesome in front of all Israel so they know I got your back just like I did with Moses.' 8. And you gotta tell the priests who carry the ark, like, when you reach the edge of the water at Jordan, just, like, pause and chill in Jordan. 9. Yo, listen up, fam! Joshua straight up told the Israelite squad, 'Yo, gather round and tune in to the words of the LORD your God.' 10. So, like, Joshua was all like, yo, this is how you'll know for sure that the living God is chillin' with you - He's gonna totally kick out all those Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites from your turf. No doubt about it, fam. 11. Yo fam, check it out! The ark of the Lord's covenant, the one that belongs to the big boss up in the heavens, is about to cross over into the Jordan River right in front of y'all. 12. Yo, listen up! I need twelve dudes, one from each tribe of Israel. Get on it! 13. And so, when the feet of the priests carrying the sacred ark of the LORD, the Almighty God, touch the waters of the Jordan River, the Jordan River's flow will stop, separating the waters above from the ones below, and creating a pile of water for them to stand on. 14. So, like, when the people left their tents to cross over the Jordan River, and the priests were carrying the sacred ark in front of them; 15. So, when those carrying the ark reached the Jordan River and the priests' feet, who were carrying the ark, touched the edge of the water (because the Jordan River was flooded during harvest season), 16. So, like, the water came down from above and formed, like, this huge heap way far from the city Adam, you know, next to Zaretan. And then, the water that flowed towards the plain, you know, the salty sea, like, ran out and stopped flowing. So the people were able to walk across, like, right in front of Jericho. 17. So, like, the priests holding the ark of the LORD's covenant stood steady on dry land in the middle of the Jordan river, and all the Israelites crossed over on dry land, until everyone had safely made it across the whole Jordan river. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 31. And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over. 2. And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host; 3. And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it. 4. Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed {this} way heretofore. {heretofore: Heb. since yesterday, and the third day} 5. And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you. 6. And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people. 7. And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, {so} I will be with thee. 8. And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan. 9. And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God. 10. And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God {is} among you, and {that} he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites. 11. Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan. 12. Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man. 13. And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, {that} the waters of Jordan shall be cut off {from} the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap. 14. And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people; 15. And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,) 16. That the waters which came down from above stood {and} rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that {is} beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, {even} the salt sea, failed, {and} were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho. 17. And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 41. So, like, after everyone crossed over the Jordan River and stuff, the LORD, like, spoke to Joshua and was all like, 2. Yo, gather up twelve dudes from the group, one guy from each tribe. 3. Yo, tell them to grab those twelve stones from where the priests were chillin' with their feet in the Jordan River. Make sure to bring 'em along with you and leave 'em in the spot where you'll crash for the night. 4. So Joshua gathered up the squad of twelve dudes, handpicked from the Israel crew, one guy from each tribe: 5. So Joshua told them, yo, go ahead and cross over in front of the ark of the LORD your God into the middle of the Jordan. And make sure each of you grabs a stone on your shoulder, representing the tribes of the children of Israel. 6. So, like, let this be a total sign for you guys. Like, when your future kids ask you someday, like, 'Yo, what's the deal with these stones?' 7. So, like, when they ask you, tell them that the water at the Jordan River got split in half by the ark of the covenant of the LORD, you know? It was like a crazy moment when it passed through, the water just split! And these stones are there as a total reminder to the kids of Israel, forever and ever. 8. So the Israelite crew, hyped up by Joshua's orders, grabbed twelve big rocks from the middle of Jordan, just like the LORD told Joshua. They made sure to grab one for each of the tribes of Israel fam. Then they hauled those rocks with them to their chill spot and dropped them there. 9. So, Joshua placed twelve stones right in the middle of the Jordan River, exactly where the priests carrying the sacred ark stood. And guess what? Those stones are still there even now! 10. So, like, the priests who were carrying the ark were standing in the middle of the Jordan River until everything was done that the LORD told Joshua to say to the people, just as Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried up and crossed over. 11. When everyone had crossed over, the ark of the LORD also crossed over, along with the priests, in front of everyone. 12. So, like, the kids from Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh, they all crossed over, armed and ready, leading the way for the rest of the Israelite gang, just like Moses told them to do, ya know? 13. Around 40k warriors flexed and marched before the LORD, ready to bring the fight to the plains of Jericho. They were armed to the teeth, no doubt! 14. That day, the LORD made Joshua super popular among all the people of Israel. They were totally in awe of him, just like they were with Moses. It stayed that way for his entire life! 15. Yo, the LORD straight up spoke to Joshua like, 16. Tell the priests carrying the holy ark to bounce out of Jordan. 17. So Joshua was like, yo priests, come outta Jordan. 18. So, once the priests who were carrying the sacred ark of the Lord stepped out of the middle of the Jordan River, their feet touched the dry ground, and suddenly the waters of the Jordan went back to where they came from and flooded over its banks, just like they were before. The priests totally rocked it! 19. So, like, the people, they crossed the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month, and set up camp in this place called Gilgal, on the eastern edge of Jericho. 20. So Joshua put those twelve stones they took from the Jordan River in Gilgal. 21. And he was like, talking to the children of Israel, and he's all like, 'Yo, whenever your kids come up to you later and be like, 'What's up with these rocks?' or whatever, you gotta tell 'em what's what, ya know?' 22. Yo, make sure you tell your homies, like, Israel crossed over this Jordan River without even gettin' wet, man. 23. Bruh, God totally made the waters of the Jordan River disappear so y'all could cross over safely. It was just like when He made the Red Sea dry so the Israelites could pass through. It was lit! 24. So that everyone on earth can see how powerful the LORD is and be in awe of Him forever. Like, fear and respect the LORD your God for like, all days and stuff. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 41. And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 2. Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 3. And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night. 4. Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 5. And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel: 6. That this may be a sign among you, {that} when your children ask {their fathers} in time to come, saying, What {mean} ye by these stones? {in time...: Heb. to morrow} 7. Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever. 8. And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there. 9. And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day. 10. For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over. 11. And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people. 12. And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them: 13. About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho. {prepared: or, ready armed} 14. On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life. 15. And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying, 16. Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan. 17. Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan. 18. And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, {and} the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as {they did} before. {lifted...: Heb. plucked up} {flowed: Heb. went} 19. And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth {day} of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho. 20. And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal. 21. And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What {mean} these stones? {in time...: Heb. to morrow} 22. Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land. 23. For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over: 24. That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the LORD, that it {is} mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God for ever. {for ever: Heb. all days} \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 51. So, like, all the cool kings of the Amorites on the side of Jordan and the kings of the Canaanites by the sea heard that the LORD totally dried up the waters of the Jordan for the Israelites to cross over. And, bro, it freaked them out big time. Their hearts melted, and they lost all their courage because of the Israelite squad. 2. So like, the LORD was all, 'Yo Joshua, grab some super sharp knives and, like, do the whole circumcision thing again on all the Israelite kids, for the second time. Like, really sharp knives, maybe even flint ones.' 3. So Joshua got some really sharp knives and circumcised all the kids in Israel up on the hill where the foreskins were cut off. #KnivesOfFlint #GibeahHaaraloth 4. So, here's why Joshua decided to circumcise: all the guys who came from Egypt, including the brave warriors, didn't make it through the wilderness alive after leaving Egypt. 5. So, like, all the people who came out were circumcised, ya know? But the ones who were born in the wilderness, on the way out of Egypt, they didn't get circumcised and stuff. 6. So, the Israelite squad spent a solid 40 years wandering the wilderness because they straight-up didn't follow the Lord's orders. It was a punishment for all the war-ready folks who dipped from Egypt but couldn't listen to the Lord's voice. Turns out the Lord swore that He wouldn't bless them with the promised land, you know, the one flowing with milk and honey that He swore to their ancestors. 7. And Joshua gave their children, the ones he took the place of, the snip-snip treatment because they hadn't been snipped during the journey. 8. And, like, after they finished circumcising everyone, they just stayed in their spots at the camp until they were healed up and stuff. You know, like, done with their circumcision and all. 9. And God was like, Joshuaa, bro, today I totally wiped out all the hate from your past life in Egypt. That's why we're chilling in this place called Gilgal, like, forever now. It's all about moving on, you know? #NoMoreHate #GilgalMeansRolling 10. So the Israel squad set up camp in Gilgal and celebrated the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, right when the sun was setting, in the plains of Jericho. 11. And they totally grubbed on some vintage snacks the day after the passover - we're talking unleavened cakes and straight-up toasted grain. It was lit, all happening on the same day. 12. And the heavenly grub stopped showing up the next day after they finished all the leftover munchies from back in the day; the Israelite squad didn't have any more heavenly grub then, but they got to indulge in the tasty treats of the Canaan land that year. 13. So, Joshua was near Jericho and he happened to look up and saw a dude standing in front of him, holding a sword. Joshua went up to him and asked, 'Are you on our side or the enemies' side?' 14. And he was like, nah bro, but I'm here as the top dog of the whole squad of the LORD. And Joshua straight up dropped to the ground, showing respect and was like, yo, what's up king, what message you got for your boy? 15. The boss of the LORD's squad was like, 'Yo Joshua, take off your kicks, 'cause where you're standin' is super holy.' And Joshua was like, 'Bet, boss' and did exactly that. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 51. And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which {were} on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which {were} by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel. 2. At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time. {sharp...: or, knives of flints} 3. And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins. {sharp...: or, knives of flints} {the hill...: or, Gibeah-haaraloth} 4. And this {is} the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, {that were} males, {even} all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt. 5. Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people {that were} born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, {them} they had not circumcised. 6. For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people {that were} men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey. 7. And their children, {whom} he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way. 8. And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole. {they had...: Heb. the people had made an end to be circumcised} 9. And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day. {Gilgal: that is Rolling} 10. And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho. 11. And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched {corn} in the selfsame day. 12. And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. 13. And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, {Art} thou for us, or for our adversaries? 14. And he said, Nay; but {as} captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant? {captain: or, prince} 15. And the captain of the LORD'S host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest {is} holy. And Joshua did so. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 61. So basically, Jericho was totally locked down because of those Israelite peeps. Nobody could leave, nobody could come in. Can't even flex, it was completely on lockdown, you feel me? 2. Yo, Josh, listen up. God just told me to tell you that He's totally handing over Jericho to you. Check it out - you're getting the whole package, the city and its boss, plus all those super tough guys. 3. And you guys, like, surround the city and all you warriors, like, go around the city one time. That's what you should do for six days. 4. And there will be seven lit priests holding up seven rad trumpets made from rams' horns. On the seventh day, y'all gotta surround the city seven times, while the priests rock the trumpets like pros. 5. And it's gonna happen, like, when they make a super loud noise with the ram's horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people gotta shout super loud. Then the city walls are gonna totally crumble, and everyone can just go straight ahead and enter. 6. So Joshua, son of Nun, shouted for the priests and told them, 'Yo, pick up the ark of the covenant and have seven priests carry seven dope rams' horn trumpets in front of it.' 7. And he was like, yo, people! Go ahead and circle the city, and make sure those with weapons go in front of the ark of the LORD. 8. So basically, Joshua was talking to the peeps and then these seven priests came through holding these lit trumpets made out of rams' horns and started playing them real loud. And guess what? The ark of the covenant of the LORD was right behind them, following their lead. 9. So the soldiers went ahead of the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and the group bringing up the rear followed the ark. The priests kept marching and blowing the trumpets. 10. So Joshua told everyone not to shout or make any noise until he says so. You gotta keep quiet and not say anything until he gives the signal. Then you can shout it out! 11. So the epic ark of the LORD totally encircled the city, doing a sick lap around it: and they rolled into the camp, and crashed at the campsite. 12. So Joshua woke up super early in the morning, and the priests grabbed the ark of the LORD. 13. So there were like seven priests holding these sick trumpets made from ram horns, and they were straight up rocking it in front of the ark of the LORD. They kept going at it, blowing those trumpets all day long. And get this, the armed dudes were leading the way, while the rest of the squad was bringing up the rear, all while the priests were still jamming on their trumpets. 14. On the second day, they circled around the city once and went back to their camp. They did the same thing for six days. 15. So, like, on the seventh day, they woke up super early, right as the sun was rising, and went around the city in the same way seven times. And, yeah, only on that day they went around the city seven times. 16. So, like, after the priests had blown the trumpets seven times, Joshua was all like, 'Yo, shout it out, guys! The LORD totally hooked you up with this city.' 17. Like, the city is gonna be super cursed, you know? And everything in it is, like, totally cursed to the Lord. But, hold up, Rahab the harlot is gonna live, alright? Like, her and everyone with her in the house, they're safe. 'Cause she hid the messengers we sent. Yeah, super blessed for that! 18. Yo, make sure you stay far away from anything that's all cursed and stuff, or else you're gonna get cursed too, you feel me? Don't go grabbin' any cursed things and messin' up the whole Israel camp. It'll just bring a whole lotta trouble, trust me. 19. But like, all the shiny silver, gold, and stuff made of brass and iron is dedicated to God, you know? It goes into the Lord's treasure chest. Like, it's all holy and sacred, bro. 20. So, like, the crowd totally went wild when the priests blew the trumpets. And when the people heard that trumpet sound, they all let out this huge shout. And you won't believe it, but the wall like completely collapsed and crumbled. So, everyone just rushed into the city, no holding back, and they totally took over the place. 21. And they totally wrecked everything in the city, like every single person - young and old, and even the animals, like cows and sheep and donkeys - they did it all with their epic sword skills. 22. So Joshua told the two guys who were scoping out the area, 'Yo, head over to the harlot's crib and bring back the woman and everything she's got, just like you promised her.' 23. The cool dudes who were undercover went in and rescued Rahab, her dad, her mom, her siblings, and everything she owned. They brought out all her extended fam and left them outside the Israel squad's camp. {kindred: in Hebrew, families} 24. And they straight up set the whole city on fire, destroying everything inside it. However, they kept the silver, gold, brass, and iron in the Lord's crib. No loot went to waste! 25. So, like, Joshua totally saved Rahab, the, um, let's say, not-so-good lady, and her whole fam and everything she owned. And get this, she still lives in Israel to this day, all because she hid the secret agents that Joshua sent to check out Jericho, you know? 26. And Joshua was like, super serious with them, and he was all like, 'Dude, I'm telling you now, anyone who dares to build this city called Jericho, they're totally gonna be cursed by the LORD. It's gnarly, man. Like, seriously cursed. They'll end up sacrificing their firstborn to lay the foundation, and their youngest kid will be the one setting up the gates. It's not gonna be good, bro. 27. So, like, God was totally vibing with Joshua, and everyone out there heard about how epic he was in the whole land. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 61. Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in. {was...: Heb. did shut up, and was shut up} 2. And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, {and} the mighty men of valour. 3. And ye shall compass the city, all {ye} men of war, {and} go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days. 4. And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. 5. And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long {blast} with the ram's horn, {and} when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him. {flat: Heb. under it} 6. And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD. 7. And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD. 8. And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. 9. And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, {the priests} going on, and blowing with the trumpets. {rereward: Heb. gathering host} 10. And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall {any} word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout. {any noise...: Heb. your voice to be heard} 11. So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about {it} once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. 12. And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. 13. And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, {the priests} going on, and blowing with the trumpets. 14. And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days. 15. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times. 16. And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city. 17. And the city shall be accursed, {even} it, and all that {are} therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that {are} with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. {accursed: or, devoted} 18. And ye, in any wise keep {yourselves} from the accursed thing, lest ye make {yourselves} accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. {accursed: or, devoted} {a curse: or, devoted} 19. But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, {are} consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD. {consecrated: Heb. holiness} 20. So the people shouted when {the priests} blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. {flat: Heb. under it} 21. And they utterly destroyed all that {was} in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword. 22. But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her. 23. And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. {kindred: Heb. families} 24. And they burnt the city with fire, and all that {was} therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD. 25. And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel {even} unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. 26. And Joshua adjured {them} at that time, saying, Cursed {be} the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest {son} shall he set up the gates of it. 27. So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was {noised} throughout all the country. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 71. But the Israelites messed up big time with the forbidden stuff. This guy Achan, from the tribe of Judah, took some of that forbidden stuff, and it made God super angry at all the Israelites. (Achan was also known as Achar, and Zabdi was also called Zimri.) 2. So Joshua sent some guys from Jericho to check out Ai, which is near Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel. He told them, 'Go on up and scope out the land.' And those dudes went up and did their inspection of Ai. 3. So they went back to Joshua and told him, 'Hey, don't send all the squad up there, just let like two or three thousand of us go take down Ai. We don't want everyone to go through all the trouble, after all, they're not that many. Ya know, just a heads up.' 4. So, like, around three thousand guys went up there, but they totally panicked and ran away from the dudes in Ai. 5. The dudes from Ai totally wrecked about 36 guys because they chased them all the way from the gate to Shebarim and took them out while they were trying to flee. This caused the people's hearts to melt like water. (Or in Morad) 6. Joshua was totally shook and completely wrecked. He straight up ripped his clothes and prostrated himself on the ground in front of the ark of the LORD, all the way until evening. And not only him, but also the elders of Israel were there, too, showing their grief by putting dust on their heads. 7. Joshua was like, OMG, Lord GOD, why did you even bring us across the Jordan River just to let the Amorites take over and destroy us? Ugh, I wish we could've just stayed on the other side of the river! 8. Yo, how am I supposed to react when Israel straight up bails on their enemies? Like, seriously! 9. Like, if the Canaanites and everyone around here find out about this, they're totally gonna come at us from all sides and erase our name from existence. So, what's your move, considering your big reputation? 10. So God was like, Joshuaa, come on now, why you laying around on your face like that? Get up!' (FYI, 'liest' means 'fallest' in Hebrew) 11. Israel messed up big time. They totally broke the deal I made with them, like, epic fail. They straight up took stuff that was cursed, stole things, lied about it, and shoved it in with their own belongings. Not cool, man. 12. So, like, the Israelites totally couldn't handle their enemies, and they straight up ran away from them. It's all because they were in, like, major trouble, you know? And let me tell you, I won't be on your side anymore unless you get rid of the troublemakers from your crew. 13. Yo, listen up! It's time to get real and clean yourselves up for tomorrow. The big man upstairs, the LORD God of Israel, has dropped some knowledge on y'all. There's some seriously bad juju going on in your midst, O Israel. You won't be able to handle your enemies until you get rid of this cursed thing among you. So, do what you gotta do and cleanse yourselves ASAP. 14. So, like, in the morning, you guys will be sorted by your tribes, ya know? And here's the deal: the tribe that the LORD chooses will show up with their fams, and the fam that the LORD picks will come with their whole squad, and each person chosen by the LORD will show up one by one, my dudes. 15. So, like, anyone who's caught with the cursed thing, they gotta get burned along with all their stuff. It's 'cause they totally broke God's covenant and did some messed up stuff in Israel. 16. So Joshua woke up super early in the morning, and gathered all the peeps from Israel according to their squads; and guess what, the squad of Judah got chosen: 17. And he gathered the crew of Judah, and he selected the squad of the Zarhites. He brought each member of the Zarhites fam one by one, and Zabdi was chosen: 18. So he made everybody in his household line up in a row, and this dude named Achan, who was the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the Judah fam, got singled out. 19. Joshua was like, 'Yo Achan, my dude, just be real with God, man. Confess your sins and spill the tea. Don't hold back, tell me everything you did. 20. So Joshua asked Achan what went down, and Achan was like, 'No doubt, I messed up big time and went against the Almighty God of Israel. Here's exactly what I did.' 21. So, like, there I was checking out all the cool stuff we got from the battle, right? And I come across this sick Babylonish outfit, some silver worth two hundred shekels, and this golden wedge weighing fifty shekels! And, man, I couldn't resist the temptation, so I just took them for myself. Now they're all stashed away in the ground in the middle of my tent, with the silver hiding underneath. (By the way, 'wedge' means tonguee' in Hebrew, just so you know.) 22. So Joshua texted his crew and they sprinted to the tent; and yo, they found it stashed in his crib, with the cash hidden underneath. 23. So they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelite squad, and showed them off in front of the LORD. 24. So, Joshua, along with all of Israel, captured this dude named Achan, who was the son of Zerah. And get this, they found some silver, a sick outfit, a gold wedge, his kids, his animals (including oxen, donkeys, and sheep), his tent, and basically everything he owned! They brought all of it to this place called the valley of Achor. 25. Joshua was like, bro, why you gotta be messing with us? God's gonna mess with you big time today. And then all of Israel straight up stoned him with rocks and burned everything after the stoning. No joke. 26. And they piled up a huge bunch of rocks over him that's still there today. So God chilled out and stopped being so mad. That's why they named that place 'The valley of Achor,' which means 'Trouble.' \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 71. But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel. {Achan: also called, Achar} {Zabdi: also called, Zimri} 2. And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which {is} beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai. 3. And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; {and} make not all the people to labour thither; for they {are but} few. {about...: Heb. about two thousand men, or, about three thousand men} 4. So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai. 5. And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them {from} before the gate {even} unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water. {in...: or, in Morad} 6. And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads. 7. And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan! 8. O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies! {backs: Heb. necks} 9. For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear {of it}, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name? 10. And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face? {liest: Heb. fallest} 11. Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put {it} even among their own stuff. 12. Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, {but} turned {their} backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you. 13. Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, {There is} an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you. 14. In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, {that} the tribe which the LORD taketh shall come according to the families {thereof}; and the family which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man. 15. And it shall be, {that} he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel. {folly: or, wickedness} 16. So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: 17. And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: 18. And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken. 19. And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide {it} not from me. 20. And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done: 21. When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they {are} hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it. {wedge: Heb. tongue} 22. So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, {it was} hid in his tent, and the silver under it. 23. And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the LORD. {laid: Heb. poured} 24. And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor. 25. And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones. 26. And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day. {Achor: that is, Trouble} \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 81. Then God was like, 'Yo Joshua, chillax and don't stress. Gather your squad and get ready to roll out to Ai. I got you, I'm giving you Ai's king, people, city, and land on a silver platter.' 2. Yo, go ahead and handle Ai and its king just like you did with Jericho and its king, except this time, you can keep all the spoils and livestock for yourselves. But wait, here's the plan: set up an ambush behind the city, okay? 3. So Joshua got up, and together with all the warriors, they went to attack Ai. Joshua handpicked 30,000 total badasses and sent them off under the cover of darkness. 4. So he tells them, like, listen up, you guys gotta chill near the city and wait, but not too far away, just be ready and stuff: 5. Me and all my squad gonna roll up to the city. And when they try to come at us like they did before, we gonna dip out real quick. 6. Yo, we gotta lead them away from the city before they catch up to us, 'cause if they see us running scared, they gonna come at us even harder. So let's dip out first and get 'em to follow our lead, just like we did before. Gotta be sneaky, like yanking 'em away from the city, you know? 7. Yo, once you finish hiding and chilling in the cut, it's time to make moves and take over the city, because the LORD your God is about to hand it to you on a platter. 8. And, like, when you take over the city, you gotta light that place up, just like the LORD told ya. Trust me, I gave you the command. 9. So Joshua sent them out to hide and they went to chill between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai. But Joshua crashed with the squad that night. 10. So, like, Joshua woke up super early in the morning and started counting all the people. He and the elders of Israel, you know, went ahead of everyone to Ai. 11. And all the peeps, even the warriors rollin' with him, went up, got closer, and approached the city. They set up camp on the north side of Ai. Yo, there was a valley between 'em and Ai tho. 12. So he gathered around 5K dudes and put them in stealth mode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. #sneaky 13. And after they had placed all the people, including their sneaky group on the west side of the city and their hidden attackers on the north side of the city, Joshua secretly entered the valley in the middle of the night. 14. So, like, the king of Ai, right? He saw what was up and he and his peeps got all hyped and woke up mad early. They all came out of the city to fight against Israel, at a set time and in the open field. But little did he know, there were sneaky liers hiding in wait behind the city! 15. So Joshua and all of Israel acted like they got totally wrecked, and dipped out through the wilderness. 16. So, like, everyone in Ai, they all got together to chase after them, you know? And they were all like, 'Let's go get Joshua!' and they totally left the city. 17. And like, dude, there wasn't even a single person left in Ai or Bethel who didn't go after Israel, ya know? They just straight up abandoned the city and started chasing after Israel. 18. Yo, God was like, Joshuaa, take that spear you got and point it towards Ai. I'm gonna make sure you win this battle.' So Joshua did just that, he stretched out his arm and aimed the spear at the city. 19. Then the surprise attack squad sprung forth from their hiding spot, bolting as soon as their leader made a hand signal. With stealth and speed, they infiltrated the city, capturing it swiftly and without delay, then setting it ablaze in haste. 20. So, like, the guys from Ai turned around and saw smoke billowing up from the city, reaching up to the sky and stuff. They were totally trapped, with no way to escape. And the people who had tried to run away and hide in the wilderness ended up running right into their pursuers. It was intense, dude. 21. So, like, Joshua and all of Israel peeped that the whole ambush thing worked and the city got taken down, and there was smoke everywhere. And then they're like, 'Alright, time to finish the job' and they took out all the dudes in Ai. 22. Then the other group came out of the city to confront them, and they were surrounded by the people of Israel, with some on one side and others on the opposite side. They attacked them and defeated them completely, leaving no survivors or escapees. 23. So they managed to capture the king of Ai and brought him back to Joshua. 24. So, like, after Israel finished totally wiping out all the people of Ai in the field, while they were running away in the wilderness, and they all got defeated by the sword, until none of them were left, all the Israelites went back to Ai and totally attacked it with their swords, dude. 25. So, like, that day was pretty intense. There were a total of 12k casualties from both guys and girls, all from the city of Ai, you know? 26. Joshua didn't hesitate to attack Ai until he had wiped out every last person there with his spear. 27. So, like, the Israel peeps totally just snagged the cows and stuff in that city as a prize for themselves, just doing what the LORD told Joshua to do. 28. So Joshua totally destroyed Ai and left it in ruins, never to be rebuilt even up to this day. 29. So, they hung the king of Ai on a tree until evening. Then, when the sun went down, Joshua ordered them to take his body down from the tree and throw it at the entrance of the city gate. They piled up a big heap of stones on top of it, and it's still there even today. 30. So Joshua flexed and constructed a mad altar for the LORD God of Israel on top of mount Ebal, 31. Just like Moses, who served the LORD, told the kids of Israel to do in the book of the law of Moses, they made an altar out of whole stones and didn't use any iron tools. They offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD on that altar. 32. And he wrote down the law of Moses on some stones, right in front of all the Israelite homies. 33. So, like, all of Israel, including their elders, officers, and judges, gathered on one side of the ark, while the priests, who were Levites, carried the ark of the LORD's covenant, you know? And it didn't matter if you were a stranger or born in Israel, they all stood there. Half of them were facing mount Gerizim, and the other half were facing mount Ebal, just like Moses, the LORD's servant, had commanded. The whole point was to bless the people of Israel, man. 34. Then he like totally read all the words of the law, you know, the blessings and cursings, like everything that was written in the book of the law. 35. Joshua made sure to read every single thing that Moses had commanded to the whole congregation of Israel, including the women, the kids, and the people who were visiting. He didn't miss a single word! \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 81. And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land: 2. And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it. 3. So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night. 4. And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, {even} behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready: 5. And I, and all the people that {are} with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them, 6. (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them. {drawn: Heb. pulled} 7. Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand. 8. And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, {that} ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD shall ye do. See, I have commanded you. 9. Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people. 10. And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai. 11. And all the people, {even the people} of war that {were} with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now {there was} a valley between them and Ai. 12. And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. {of...: or, of Ai} 13. And when they had set the people, {even} all the host that {was} on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley. {liers...: Heb. lying in wait} 14. And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw {it}, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that {there were} liers in ambush against him behind the city. 15. And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness. 16. And all the people that {were} in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city. 17. And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel. 18. And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that {is} in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that {he had} in his hand toward the city. 19. And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire. 20. And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers. {power: Heb. hand} 21. And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai. 22. And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape. 23. And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua. 24. And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword. 25. And {so} it was, {that} all that fell that day, both of men and women, {were} twelve thousand, {even} all the men of Ai. 26. For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 27. Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua. 28. And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, {even} a desolation unto this day. 29. And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, {that remaineth} unto this day. 30. Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in mount Ebal, 31. As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up {any} iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings. 32. And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel. 33. And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them; half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel. 34. And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law. 35. There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them. {were...: Heb. walked} \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 91. So like, this happened when all the kings on the other side of the Jordan River, up in the hills, down in the valleys, and along the coastline of the big sea across from Lebanon (you know, the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites), heard about it. 2. So they all joined forces to go up against Joshua and the Israelites, united as one. {Heb. mouth} 3. So like, when the people in Gibeon found out about the sick moves Joshua pulled on Jericho and Ai, 4. They were lowkey scheming and decided to act all official by pretending to be ambassadors. They threw some worn-out sacks on their donkeys and carried old and torn wine bottles. 5. They were wearing worn-out shoes and patched clothes, and all their food was stale and covered in mold. 6. So they went up to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the people of Israel, 'Hey, we've come all the way from a distant land. So, like, let's make a chill agreement, okay?' 7. So, like, the dudes from Israel were all like, 'Yo, maybe you Hivites live around here, right? How are we supposed to make this alliance thingy with you?' 8. And they were like, yo Joshua, we're here to serve you. And Joshua was like, who even are you guys? Where y'all come from? 9. And they were like, 'Dude, we come from, like, a hella distant place 'cause we heard about the epicness of the LORD your God. We've been hearing all about the sick stuff He pulled off in Egypt, ya know? 10. And all the stuff he did to those two Amorite kings, you know, the ones across the Jordan River - Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, who ruled from Ashtaroth. 11. So, like, the older peeps and everyone in our hood were all like, 'Yo, grab some grub for the trip and go meet them, and tell 'em we're down to be your peeps and make a pact, ya know?' 12. Yo, this bread we grabbed fresh from our cribs when we dipped out to see you ain't lookin' so lit anymore – it's all crusty and moldy now, smh 😬 13. So like, these flasks of wine we filled up were totally new, right? But check it out, they got all torn and messed up. And now our clothes and shoes are just hella worn out from this insanely long trip we've been on. It's been rough, man. 14. And the guys grabbed their grub, without bothering to seek advice from the Big Guy upstairs. (Or, as they say, 'they didn't consult the Lord's hotline'). 15. So Joshua was like, 'Yo, let's be cool with each other' and they were all like, 'Yeah, good idea, bro.' They made a pact to coexist, and the leaders of the community promised to honor it. 16. So after about three days of forming an alliance with them, they found out that those peeps were actually their next-door homies living in the same hood. 17. So, the Israelite squad hit the road and rolled up to their cities on the third day. These cities were called Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim. 18. The Israelites didn't attack them because their leaders made a promise to them in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. But the whole group started complaining about their leaders. 19. But like, all the high-ups were like, yo to the entire crew, we made a serious promise to them in the name of the LORD God of Israel and so we can't lay a finger on them, man. 20. So here's the deal, we won't touch them. We'll let them live, you know, to avoid getting ourselves into some serious bad vibes and all, because we made this promise to them and we gotta keep our word. 21. The leaders were like, 'Okay, fine. Let them live, but they gotta be the ones doing all the hard labor for everyone else.' Just like they said they would. 22. So Joshua was like, 'Yo, come here.' And he talked to them, and he was like, 'Why'd you play us like that, saying you were mad far away from us when you're actually living right here?' 23. So, like, you guys messed up big time and now you're totally cursed. There's, like, no escaping it - you're gonna be stuck as servants, doing all the hard labor like chopping wood and fetching water for the house of my God. Seriously, there's no way out of this punishment. Can't catch a break, I guess. #toughluck 24. So, like, we totally heard, Joshua, that your crew got the memo from the big man upstairs, ya know, the LORD your God. He straight up commanded his boy Moses to hook you all up with the land, and to completely wipe out everyone who was chillin' there before you. And, like, we were seriously scared for our lives 'cause of you, so we ended up doing what we did, you feel me? 25. And like, we're totally at your mercy, dude. So, whatever you think is cool and fair to do to us, go ahead and do it. 26. And he did the same to them, and saved them from the children of Israel, so they didn't kill them. 27. So, Joshua assigned them the job of chopping wood and carrying water for the people and the LORD's altar. This tradition has continued to this day in the chosen location. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 91. And it came to pass, when all the kings which {were} on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard {thereof}; 2. That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord. {accord: Heb. mouth} 3. And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai, 4. They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; 5. And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry {and} mouldy. 6. And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us. 7. And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you? 8. And they said unto Joshua, We {are} thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who {are} ye? and from whence come ye? 9. And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt, 10. And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that {were} beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which {was} at Ashtaroth. 11. Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We {are} your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us. {with you: Heb. in your hand} 12. This our bread we took hot {for} our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy: 13. And these bottles of wine, which we filled, {were} new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey. 14. And the men took of their victuals, and asked not {counsel} at the mouth of the LORD. {the men...: or, they received the men by reason of their victuals} 15. And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them. 16. And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they {were} their neighbours, and {that} they dwelt among them. 17. And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities {were} Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim. 18. And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes. 19. But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them. 20. This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them. 21. And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them. 22. And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We {are} very far from you; when ye dwell among us? 23. Now therefore ye {are} cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God. {none...: Heb. not be cut off from you} 24. And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing. 25. And now, behold, we {are} in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do. 26. And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not. 27. And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose. {made: Heb. gave, or, delivered to be} \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 101. So, like, Adonizedek, the king of Jerusalem, heard, ya know, news about Joshua totally wrecking Ai, just like he did with Jericho. And, get this, the people of Gibeon made peace with Israel and joined 'em. Like, big moves, man 2. They were totally shook because Gibeon was a legit massive city, like one of those fancy royal cities, and it was even bigger than Ai, plus all the dudes there were super strong. #impressive 3. So Adonizedek, the ruler of Jerusalem, reached out to Hoham, the boss of Hebron, and Piram, the top dog of Jarmuth, and Japhia, the kingpin of Lachish, and Debir, the head honcho of Eglon, with a message, 4. Yo, come join me and let's wreck Gibeon together. They made peace with Joshua and the Israelite crew. 5. So, like, the five rulers of the Amorites - the ruler of Jerusalem, the ruler of Hebron, the ruler of Jarmuth, the ruler of Lachish, the ruler of Eglon - got together and, like, gathered their armies. They camped before Gibeon and were all ready to go to war against them. 6. So, like, the dudes from Gibeon hit up Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, and they were all like, 'Yo, don't chillax, bro! Come through and help us out ASAP! We're getting wrecked here by all the kings of the Amorites up in the mountains, they all ganged up on us!' 7. So Joshua and his squad rolled out from Gilgal, along with all the warriors and the legendary badasses. 8. And God was like, Joshuaa, don't even trip! I'm totally handing them over to you. Not a single one of them will be able to stand against you.' 9. So Joshua shows up out of nowhere and heads out from Gilgal in the middle of the night. 10. Yo, God totally wrecked those dudes in front of Israel, straight up killed 'em in a major showdown at Gibeon, then chased 'em along the road that goes up to Bethhoron, and totally smoked 'em all the way to Azekah and Makkedah. 11. So, here's what happened: as the enemies tried to escape from Israel and were near Bethhoron, the LORD dropped some massive stones from the sky on them, right to Azekah, and they bit the dust. And get this - more of them were taken down by those hailstones than by the swords of the children of Israel. 12. So Joshua was talking to God that day when God handed over the Amorites to the Israelites, and he said in front of everyone, 'Yo, Sun, stay put over Gibeon, and Moon, chill in the valley of Ajalon.' (*whispering*: or be silent, you know). 13. And yo, check this out, the sun was straight up chillin', didn't move an inch, and the moon was like 'hold up, I got you too', all because the peeps needed to get revenge on their enemies. Ain't this written in that book called Jasher? So yeah, the sun stayed right where it was in the sky, didn't even rush to go down for a whole day. (Jasher might mean 'the upright' or something, just sayin') 14. OMG, like no other day in HISTORY, before or after, the LORD actually LISTENED to a human's voice! It was lit AF because the LORD was totally fighting for Israel! 🙌 15. So Joshua and all of Israel went back to the camp at Gilgal. 16. So these five kings yeeted out and went into hiding in a sick cave at Makkedah. 17. So, like, word got to Joshua saying that, dude, the five kings are all, like, hiding out in this cave at Makkedah. 18. Joshua was like, yo, let's put some big-ass rocks in front of the cave and station dudes there to guard it, no joke. 19. Don't hold back, go after your enemies and take down the stragglers. Don't let them retreat to their cities, because the LORD your God has given them into your control. They're done for! 20. So, like, after Joshua and the cool kids of Israel finished totally wrecking their enemies with a mega brutal attack until they were completely wiped out, the few survivors who were left decided to seek shelter in fortified cities, you know? 21. Then everyone went back to Joshua at the camp in Makkedah, no one said anything negative about the children of Israel. 22. So Joshua was like, yo, open up that cave and bring me those five kings from inside the cave. 23. And they did that, and brought those five kings to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. 24. So, when they brought out those kings to Joshua, he called for all the guys in Israel and told the war captains who were with him, 'Hey, come up close and put your feet on the necks of these kings.' And they went up close and put their feet on their necks. 25. Yo, Joshua was like, calm down fam, don't be afraid or stressed out or anything. Stay strong and brave, 'cause the Lord's got your back. He's gonna handle all those enemies y'all are up against. 26. And then Joshua totally wrecked them, straight up killed them, and hung them on five trees: and they were just hanging there until the sun went down. 27. So Joshua was like, 'Yo, it's sunset time,' and he told his crew to take those dudes off the trees and throw them into the cave where they were hiding. Then they put huge rocks to seal off the cave, and those rocks are still there to this day. 28. So, Joshua totally conquered Makkedah that day and gave it a good whack with his sword. He completely wiped out their king, along with everyone else in the city. He left no survivors, just like he did to the king of Jericho. 29. So Joshua and all of Israel kept moving after conquering Makkedah, and went to Libnah, where they battled against the people there: 30. And God totally handed it over to Israel, along with the king, and they totally defeated it with their swords, and everyone there got defeated too, they left no one alive, and they totally did to the king what they did to the king of Jericho. 31. So Joshua took his crew and bounced from Libnah to Lachish. They set up camp, ready to throw down and battle against it: 32. And God handed over Lachish to Israel, who took it on the second day, and attacked it with swords, and all the people inside, just like what happened in Libnah. 33. So, Horam, the king of Gezer, decided to give Lachish a hand and join the fight. But Joshua totally owned him and his crew, wiping them out completely. 34. So Joshua went from Lachish to Eglon, with all of Israel by his side. They set up camp and went to war against it: 35. And they totally wrecked it that day, slashing it with their epic swords, and completely wiped out all the people inside, just like they did to Lachish. 36. So Joshua and all the cool Israel peeps rolled up to Hebron, ready to throw down and go to war against it: 37. And they just straight up attacked it with swords, yo. They didn't spare nobody - they took out the king, all the cities, and every single person there. They left no survivors, like for real. It was like what happened to Eglon - complete destruction, man. Nobody was left standing. 38. So Joshua and all of Israel went back to Debir and battled against it. 39. Then he completely took over the whole place, including the king and all the cities. They defeated them using their swords and wiped out every single person there. Not a single soul was left behind. He did the same thing to Debir and its king, just like he did to Hebron. And he also did it to Libnah and its king. 40. So Joshua straight up wrecked all the hilly, southern, valley, and spring regions, along with their kings. He didn't leave a single soul alive, just completely wiped out everyone, just like the LORD God of Israel ordered. 41. Joshua totally wrecked those dudes from Kadeshbarnea all the way to Gaza, and he even dominated the entire region of Goshen up to Gibeon. 42. Joshua totally dominated all these kings and their territories in one shot, thanks to the epic power of the LORD God of Israel who fought alongside Israel. 43. So Joshua and all of Israel went back to the camp at Gilgal, yo! \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 101. Now it came to pass, when Adonizedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them; 2. That they feared greatly, because Gibeon {was} a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it {was} greater than Ai, and all the men thereof {were} mighty. {royal...: Heb. cities of the kingdom} 3. Wherefore Adonizedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying, 4. Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel. 5. Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it. 6. And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us. 7. So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour. 8. And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee. 9. Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, {and} went up from Gilgal all night. 10. And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah. 11. And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, {and} were in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: {they were} more which died with hailstones than {they} whom the children of Israel slew with the sword. 12. Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon. {stand...: Heb. be silent} 13. And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. {Is} not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day. {Jasher: or, the upright?} 14. And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for Israel. 15. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. 16. But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah. 17. And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah. 18. And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them: 19. And stay ye not, {but} pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand. {smite...: Heb. cut off the tail} 20. And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest {which} remained of them entered into fenced cities. 21. And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel. 22. Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave. 23. And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, {and} the king of Eglon. 24. And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them. 25. And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies against whom ye fight. 26. And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening. 27. And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, {that} Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, {which remain} until this very day. 28. And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that {were} therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho. 29. Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah: 30. And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that {were} therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho. 31. And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it: 32. And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that {were} therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah. 33. Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining. 34. And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it: 35. And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that {were} therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish. 36. And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it: 37. And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that {were} therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that {were} therein. 38. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it: 39. And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that {were} therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king. 40. So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded. 41. And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon. 42. And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel. 43. And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 111. So, like, Jabin, the king of Hazor, heard about all that stuff happening, ya know? And he was like, 'Yo, let's hit up Jobab, the king of Madon, and also the kings of Shimron and Achshaph.' 2. And to the kings that were up north in the mountains, and down south in the plains near Chinneroth, and in the valley, and along the borders of Dor on the west, 3. And there were, like, Canaanites everywhere, to the east and to the west, and also Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites up in the mountains, and even Hivites chillin' under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. 4. So they all came out, with their entire squads, a huge crowd that stretched out as far as you could see, like a massive wave crashing on the beach. And they rolled in with loads of horses and countless chariots. 5. So like, when all these kings were like, gathered up and stuff, they all showed up and set up camp together at the waters of Merom, to like, fight against Israel. #epicbattle 6. And God was like, yo Joshua, don't even stress about those guys, 'cause tomorrow around this time, I'm gonna give you their dead bodies to conquer. You gotta mess up their horses and straight up burn their chariots with fire, no mercy! 7. So Joshua and his whole squad of warriors rolled up on these guys by the waters of Merom out of nowhere, and they straight up launched an attack on them. 8. So the LORD gave Israel a major win and they totally crushed their enemies, chasing them all the way to the cities of Zidon, Misrephothmaim, and the valley of Mizpeh. They kept winning battles until there was no one left standing. 🙌🏼 {Zidonrabbah: a.k.a. Big Zidon} {Misrephothmaim: also known as the Salt Pits: in Hebrew, it means Burnings of waters} 9. So Joshua did what the LORD told him to do: he disabled their horses and set their chariots on fire. 10. So, like, Joshua totally took charge and went back to Hazor. He straight up defeated the king there with his sword, you know? 'Cause Hazor used to be the top dog, ruling over all those other kingdoms. 11. And they straight up destroyed everyone there with their swords, like, no survivors whatsoever. Then they burned Hazor to the ground. Seriously, not a single person left standing. Crazy, right? 12. Joshua straight up took down and wiped out all the cities and kings, just like Moses, the LORD's servant, told him to. He was total boss mode with that sword! 13. So, like, all the cities that were super strong, Israel didn't burn any of them except for Hazor — that one, Joshua totally burned down, you know? 14. So the Israelites claimed all the loot from these cities and took their livestock as well. They fought and defeated every single person, using their swords until they completely wiped them out. They didn't spare anyone, not even a single soul. 15. Moses totally passed on everything the LORD told him to Joshua, and Joshua did the same, not missing a single thing that the LORD told Moses. (BTW, 'left...: Heb. removed nothing) 16. So Joshua claimed all that land, with the hills, the south country, Goshen, the valley, the plain, the mountain of Israel, and the valley too; 17. He totally conquered all the cool kings from the mount Halak to Seir, all the way to Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon beneath mount Hermon. He straight up took them down, smacked them, and brought them to an end. 18. Joshua fought against those kings for, like, forever. 19. There wasn't a single city that decided to chill with the Israelite crew, except for the Hivites living in Gibeon. Those dudes managed to avoid a fight, while all the other cities got straight up conquered. 20. The LORD made their hearts stubborn so they would go against Israel in battle and end up totally wiped out. He wanted them to have no chance, just like the LORD told Moses to do. 21. So Joshua showed up and totally wiped out the Anakims from the mountains like Hebron, Debir, Anab, and all the mountains in Judah and Israel. He straight up destroyed them, cities and all. 22. Like, all the Anakims were totally gone from the land of the Israelite peeps, except for in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod. They were the only ones left, fam. 23. So Joshua totally conquered the entire land, just like the LORD instructed Moses. Then Joshua divided it up among the tribes of Israel as their inheritance. And finally, the land chilled out and enjoyed some peace after all the fighting. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 111. And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard {those things}, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 2. And to the kings that {were} on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west, 3. {And to} the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and {to} the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and {to} the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. 4. And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that {is} upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many. 5. And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel. {met...: Heb. assembled by appointment} 6. And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. 7. So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them. 8. And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining. {great Zidon: or, Zidonrabbah} {Misrephothmaim: or, Salt pits: Heb. Burnings of waters} 9. And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire. 10. And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms. 11. And they smote all the souls that {were} therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying {them}: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire. {any...: Heb. any breath} 12. And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, {and} he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the LORD commanded. 13. But {as for} the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; {that} did Joshua burn. {in their...: Heb. on their heap} 14. And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe. 15. As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD commanded Moses. {left...: Heb. removed nothing} 16. So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same; 17. {Even} from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them. {the mount...: or, the smooth mountain} 18. Joshua made war a long time with all those kings. 19. There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all {other} they took in battle. 20. For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, {and} that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses. 21. And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities. 22. There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained. 23. So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 121. So, like, these were the kings of the land that the Israelites totally defeated and took over their territory on the other side of the Jordan River, towards where the sun rises. They conquered everything from the Arnon River to Mount Hermon, and all the land in the east. 2. Yo, check it out, Sihon, the king of the Amorites, chilled in Heshbon. He was straight-up ruling from Aroer, right by the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, all the way to half of Gilead, and even up to the river Jabbok, which was the border of the Ammonites. 3. And from the flat areas all the way to the Chinneroth ocean in the east, and to the plain ocean, yup, the salty sea in the east, leading to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, below Ashdothpisgah: you know, Teman; or, Ashdothpisgah, the cool springs of Pisgah, or the hill, you know? 4. And the territory controlled by Og, the king of Bashan who was one of the last surviving giants, and he ruled over Ashtaroth and Edrei. 5. And totally ruled over Mount Hermon, Salcah, and all of Bashan, all the way to where the Geshurites and Maachathites lived, and even half of Gilead, which was the territory of King Sihon of Heshbon. 6. So Moses, who was like a servant of the LORD, defeated them together with the children of Israel. After their victory, Moses, the LORD's servant, gave the land as a possession to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half of the Manasseh tribe. 7. And these are the total bosses that Joshua and the Israelite squad straight up owned on the west side of the Jordan River, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon all the way up to Mount Halak that leads to Seir. Joshua totally hooked up the tribes of Israel with this land as their own, each tribe getting their piece, no doubt. 8. In the mountains, valleys, plains, springs, wilderness, and southern region, there were the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 9. Got one king in Jericho and one king by Bethel, known as Ai. 10. The boss of Jerusalem, only one; the boss of Hebron, only one; 11. Yas, the king of Jarmuth was one, and the king of Lachish was also one; 12. Eglon had one king and Gezer had one king, yo! 13. We got one king from Debir and one king from Geder. 14. Hormah had one king, and Arad had one king too; 15. We got the king of Libnah, like, y'know, one dude; and then we got the king of Adullam, also one dude; 16. Makkedah's boss, one; Bethel's ruler, one; 17. The king of Tappuah, legit one; the king of Hepher, also just one; 18. The ruler of Aphek, just one; the ruler of Lasharon, also just one; {Lasharon: or, Sharon} 19. One king in Madon, and one king in Hazor; 20. The ruler of Shimronmeron, uno; the ruler of Achshaph, uno; 21. There was this dude ruling over Taanach and another dude ruling over Megiddo. 22. Kedesh had one king, and Jokneam of Carmel had one king too. 23. The ruler of Dor in the chill coast of Dor, like, one dude; and also the ruler of the Gilgal nations, just one, you know? 24. There was this dude who reigned in Tirzah, he's the only one from there. So yeah, there were like thirty other kings too, making it a total of thirty-one kings in the mix, you know? \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 121. Now these {are} the kings of the land, which the children of Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east: 2. Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, {and} ruled from Aroer, which {is} upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, {which is} the border of the children of Ammon; 3. And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and unto the sea of the plain, {even} the salt sea on the east, the way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah: {the south: or, Teman} {Ashdothpisgah: or, the springs of Pisgah, or, the hill} 4. And the coast of Og king of Bashan, {which was} of the remnant of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 5. And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan, unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. 6. Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it {for} a possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh. 7. And these {are} the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel {for} a possession according to their divisions; 8. In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: 9.

      "Gen Z: Joshua 131. So Joshua was, like, really old and getting up there in years. And the LORD was like, 'Dude, you're seriously old now and not as young as you used to be, but there's still a ton of land that needs to be conquered and claimed. Like, seriously, there's a lot to do, man.' 2. So basically, there's still this land left, you know? It's like the whole area of the Philistines and even Geshuri.  3. From Sihor, which is like right before Egypt, all the way up to the Ekron borders in the north, which is like part of Canaan: there are five big shots ruling over the Philistines - we've got the Gazathites, the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; plus the Avites too. 4. Going all the way down south, covering the whole territory of the Canaanites, including the spot called Mearah, which is right beside the Sidonians, extending until Aphek, reaching the borders of the Amorites. Mearah, by the way, is another name for 'the cave'. 5. And like, the Giblites' turf and all of Lebanon, towards where the sun comes up, from Baalgad to Mount Hermon and all the way to Hamath. 6. I'm gonna make sure all the peeps living in the hills from Lebanon to Misrephothmaim, including the Sidonians, get kicked out so the Israelite squad can take over. Just make sure you divide it up fairly through a lucky draw for the Israelites to inherit, like I told you to do. 7. So like, let's split up this land into portions for the nine tribes and, like, this half tribe called Manasseh. 8. The Reubenites and the Gadites got their land inheritance from Moses himself, on the east side of the Jordan River, just like the LORD's faithful servant Moses gave it to them. 9. From the town of Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and the city that sits in the middle of the river, and all the flat area of Medeba to Dibon; 10. And, like, all the cities that this dude Sihon, who was the king of the Amorites, ruled over in Heshbon, all the way to the border of the Ammonites, you know. 11. And like, Gilead and the whole area of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and also like, all of mount Hermon, and all of Bashan all the way to Salcah; 12. So, like, all of Og's kingdom in Bashan, you know, he was the ruler in Ashtaroth and Edrei. These were the last remaining giants, like, seriously. And then Moses came along and totally smacked them down and kicked them out. 13. But, like, the Israelite peeps didn't totally kick out the Geshurites or the Maachathites, ya know? So, like, these Geshurites and Maachathites still live among the Israelites even till today, man. 14. The tribe of Levi didn't get any land for themselves, but they got something special from the LORD God of Israel - making sacrifices with fire is their thing, just like He told them. 15. So Moses hooked up the crew from the tribe of Reuben with their land, you know, based on how their families were set up. 16. Their territory extended from Aroer, which is on the edge of the Arnon River, to the city located in the middle of the river, and encompassed the entire plain near Medeba. 17. Heshbon, and all the chill cities in the flatlands; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon, the crib of Baal, and the lit house of Baalmeon 18. And like, Jahazah, Kedemoth, and Mephaath, 19. And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the cool mountain valley, 20. And also Bethpeor, Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth, which can be called like the springs of Pisgah, or, the hill. 21. And, like, all the cities in the flatlands and the entire kingdom of Sihon, who was like, the king of the Amorites and ruled over Heshbon. Moses totally destroyed this guy along with some other important dudes from Midian – Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. These guys were like the top dogs in Sihon's land. 22. So, like, Israel totally took out Balaam, who was Beor's son and a total psychic, too. They just slayed him with their swords, along with all the other guys they took down. Just sayin', 'diviner' is another way to say 'soothsayer'. 23. So, like, the land that belonged to the Reubenites was all along the Jordan River and stuff. That was their piece of the pie, ya know? It included their families, the cool cities, and the chill villages. 24. So Moses hooked up the tribe of Gad with their inheritance, you know, the children of Gad got what they deserved based on their fam vibes. 25. And they had Jazer on their turf, along with all the lit cities in Gilead, and like half the land that belonged to the Ammonite crew, all the way to Aroer, fam, right before Rabbah. 26. And from Heshbon all the way to Ramathmizpeh, Betonim included; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir; 27. In the valley, there's Betharam, Bethnimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, along with the rest of Sihon's kingdom, who was the king of Heshbon. The Jordan River and its boundary stretch all the way to the edge of the Chinnereth sea on the east side of the river. 28. This is what the squad of Gad gets as their inheritance, like, the towns and chill spots where they can crash. 29. So Moses hooked up the half tribe of Manasseh with their property, and this is what the half tribe of Manasseh owned, split up by their different families. 30. Their territory stretched from Mahanaim to all of Bashan, including the entire kingdom ruled by King Og of Bashan, along with the numerous cities of Jair located in Bashan, totaling sixty cities in all. 31. And like, just so you know, like half of Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei were cities that belonged to the kingdom of Og in Bashan. They were, like, totally owned by the children of Machir, who was the son of Manasseh. And like, not to be specific, but like half of the children of Machir claimed these cities as part of their families. 32. So, like, Moses totally divided up these countries for the peeps to inherit in the plains of Moab, right across the Jordan, near Jericho, on the east side. 33. But the tribe of Levi didn't get any land as inheritance from Moses. The LORD God of Israel was all they needed, just like He told them. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 131. Now Joshua was old {and} stricken in years; and the LORD said unto him, Thou art old {and} stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed. {to...: Heb. to possess it} 2. This {is} the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri, 3. From Sihor, which {is} before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, {which} is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites: 4. From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that {is} beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites: {Mearah: or, the cave} 5. And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath. 6. All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim, {and} all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee. 7. Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh, 8. With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, {even} as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them; 9. From Aroer, that {is} upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that {is} in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon; 10. And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon; 11. And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah; 12. All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for these did Moses smite, and cast them out. 13. Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day. 14. Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance; the sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire {are} their inheritance, as he said unto them. 15. And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben {inheritance} according to their families. 16. And their coast was from Aroer, that {is} on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that {is} in the midst of the river, and all the plain by Medeba; 17. Heshbon, and all her cities that {are} in the plain; Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon, {Bamothbaal...: or, the high places of Baal, and house of Baalmeon} 18. And Jahazah, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath, 19. And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley, 20. And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth, {Ashdothpisgah: or, springs of Pisgah, or, the hill} 21. And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, {which were} dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country. 22. Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them. {soothsayer: or, diviner} 23. And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the border {thereof}. This {was} the inheritance of the children of Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages thereof. 24. And Moses gave {inheritance} unto the tribe of Gad, {even} unto the children of Gad according to their families. 25. And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that {is} before Rabbah; 26. And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir; 27. And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, Jordan and {his} border, {even} unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward. 28. This {is} the inheritance of the children of Gad after their families, the cities, and their villages. 29. And Moses gave {inheritance} unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and {this} was {the possession} of the half tribe of the children of Manasseh by their families. 30. And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which {are} in Bashan, threescore cities: 31. And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, {were pertaining} unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh, {even} to the one half of the children of Machir by their families. 32. These {are the countries} which Moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan, by Jericho, eastward. 33. But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not {any} inheritance: the LORD God of Israel {was} their inheritance, as he said unto them. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 141. So, here's where the Israelites got their land in Canaan: Eleazar the priest, Joshua (Nun's son), and the big shots from the tribes made sure everyone got their fair share. 2. Their inheritance was chosen by drawing lots, just as the LORD commanded through Moses, for the nine tribes and the half tribe. 3. So like, Moses had hooked up two and a half tribes with land across the Jordan, but he didn't give the Levites any land of their own, you know? 4. So, like, the kids of Joseph were split into two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and because of that they didn't give any land to the Levites, except for some cities where they could live, you know, and keep their animals and stuff. 5. Yo, the Lord was like, Mosess, do this!' So the kids of Israel were like, 'Totally, bro!' And they split up the land. 6. So, like, the peeps from Judah rolled up to Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, the Kenezite, was all like, 'Yo, you remember what the LORD told Moses, the man of God, about us when we were in Kadeshbarnea, right?' 7. I was 40 years old when Moses, the servant of the LORD, sent me from Kadeshbarnea to check out the land. I told him exactly what I honestly felt about it. 8. But yo, my squad that rolled with me straight up made the peeps scared AF, but I stayed 100% loyal to the LORD my God. 9. And Moses was like, 'I swear, dude! Today I'm telling you, no doubt, the land where you've walked your kicks on will totally be yours and your kids' forever. Why? 'Cause you've been all in, completely following the LORD, my God! 10. Yo, listen up. God has legit kept me alive, just like He promised, for a solid 45 years. He spoke these words to Moses way back when the whole Israel crew was trekking through the wilderness. And check it, today I'm rocking 85 years of life. Can't believe it, man. *wandered: Hebrew for walked* 11. Yo, I'm still as fierce today as I was back when Moses sent me. My strength back then is still my strength now, both for battle and for movin' in and out! 12. So, like, can I have this mountain that the LORD was talking about that one day? Because, you know, I heard back then that there were these Anakims there and that the cities were all big and strong. But, hey, if the LORD's got my back, I believe I can totally kick them out, just like He said. 13. Joshua gave Caleb, son of Jephunneh, a blessing and granted him Hebron as his inheritance. 14. So Hebron was given to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and it's his till today because he was fully committed to following the LORD, the God of Israel. 15. So, before it was called Hebron, it was known as Kirjatharba, where this dude named Arba, who was like a total legend among the Anakims, used to rule. And believe it or not, during that time, the land was finally able to chill out and have some peaceful moments without all the war drama going on. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 141. And these {are the countries} which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them. 2. By lot {was} their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and {for} the half tribe. 3. For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them. 4. For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell {in}, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance. 5. As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land. 6. Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea. 7. Forty years old {was} I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as {it was} in mine heart. 8. Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God. 9. And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God. 10. And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while {the children of} Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I {am} this day fourscore and five years old. {wandered: Heb. walked} 11. As yet I {am as} strong this day as {I was} in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength {was} then, even so {is} my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in. 12. Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims {were} there, and {that} the cities {were} great {and} fenced: if so be the LORD {will be} with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said. 13. And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance. 14. Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel. 15. And the name of Hebron before {was} Kirjatharba; {which Arba was} a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 151. So this is what went down for the tribe of Judah. Each fam repped their own territory, and their southern boundary reached all the way to Edom's border—specifically, the wild desert of Zin. That's as far south as it gets, my dudes. 2. And their southern border went from the beach of the salty sea, from the cool bay that faces towards the south: {bay: in Hebrew, they call it tongue} 3. Then it went down to the cool spot called Maalehacrabbim, and continued on to Zin. From there, it climbed up the southern side all the way to Kadeshbarnea, then moved along to Hezron, and made its way up to Adar. Finally, it took a turn towards Karkaa and completed its journey. (Maalehacrebbim can also be known as the ascent to Acrabbim) 4. So then it went towards Azmon and ended up at the river of Egypt, and the borders reached the sea. This is gonna be your southern border, just FYI. 5. The eastern boundary was like the salt sea, stretching all the way to the Jordan River. And their northern border started from the coastline, where the sea meets the Jordan River. 6. And the boundary went all the way to Bethhogla, then moved up to the northern side of Betharabah, and continued on to the famous rock named Bohan, who was Reuben's son: 7. And the boundary went up towards Debir from the valley of Achor, and then northward, facing Gilgal, which is before the ascent to Adummim, on the south side of the river. And the boundary continued towards the springs of Enshemesh, and its limits reached Enrogel. 8. And the border went all the way up through the valley of the son of Hinnom to the really cool southern part of Jebusite (aka Jerusalem). Then the border continued up to the top of the mountain that faces the Hinnom valley on the west side, you know, at the end of the valley where the giants used to hang out in the north. 9. So basically, the border starts from the highest point of the hill and goes all the way to the water fountain of Nephtoah. Then it extends to the cities on Mount Ephron and reaches Baalah, also known as Kirjathjearim. 10. And the border went from Baalah all the way to mount Seir in the west, then continued to the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side. It went down to Bethshemesh and continued on to Timnah. 11. And the border went all the way to the side of Ekron to the north: and the border went towards Shicron, and ran along to mount Baalah, and reached to Jabneel; and the end of the border was at the sea. 12. So, like, the western boundary was, you know, the huge ocean and everything along it. That's basically where the peeps from the tribe of Judah settled, you know, all around, according to their fams. 13. And Caleb, son of Jephunneh, was blessed with a share in the land of Judah as commanded by the LORD to Joshua. He received the city of Arba, also known as Hebron, which was the hometown of Anak's father. 14. So, Caleb totally kicked out these three dudes named Anak's sons, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, who happened to be these really big and strong guys. 15. Then he went to the people of Debir, and Debir used to be called Kirjathsepher. 16. So Caleb was like, yo, whoever straight up conquers Kirjathsepher and seizes it, I'll hook them up with my daughter Achsah as their wifey. 17. So Othniel, Kenaz's son and Caleb's brother, snagged it and scored Achsah, his babe, as his wifey. 18. So, as she approached him, she convinced him to request a piece of land from her father. And she hopped off her donkey, and Caleb asked her, 'What do you want?'} 19. Then she was like, 'Yo, can you hook me up with a favor? You've already blessed me with some sweet land down south. Can you also bless me with some fresh water springs?' And the dude was cool and totally gave her both the springs, the ones up top and the ones down below. 20. This is what the tribe of the children of Judah gets as their inheritance, you know, based on their families and stuff. 21. The farthest cities in the tribe of the kids from Judah towards the Edom seaside in the south were Kabzeel, Eder, and Jagur. 22. And like, Kinah, Dimonah, and Adadah, 23. And, like, Kedesh, Hazor, and Ithnan, you know? 24. Ziph, Telem, and Bealoth, fam, 25. And like, there's Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, ya know, and also Hezron, which is totally Hazor, you feel me? 26. Amam, Shema, and Moladah, fam! 27. And like, Hazargaddah, Heshmon, and Bethpalet or whatever, 28. And like, Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah, 29. Baalah, Iim, and Azem, fam. 30. And then there's Eltolad, Chesil, and Hormah, of course. 31. And just like, Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah, 32. And like, there's Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon - these cities add up to twenty-nine, ya know, with all their villages and stuff: 33. And down in the valley, Eshtaol, Zoreah, and Ashnah were there, 34. And Zanoah, Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam, 35. Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah - straight up game strong! 36. And like, Sharaim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim were, like, fourteen cities with their villages. And I mean Gederothaim too, you know? 37. Zenan, Hadashah, and Migdalgad were on the map, peeps! 38. And like, there's also Dilean, Mizpeh, and Joktheel, you know? 39. Yoo, Lachish, Bozkath, and Eglon were the real OGs, 40. And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish, fam. 41. And there were Gederoth, Bethdagon, Naamah, and Makkedah; that's like sixteen cities along with their chill neighborhoods: 42. So like, there's this like place called Libnah, and then you got Ether and Ashan, you know? 43. And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib, 44. And like, there was Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah, yo; like, nine cities with all their chill villages and stuff: 45. Yo, check out Ekron and all its lit suburbs and chill neighborhoods: 46. From Ekron to the sea, and all the surrounding areas of Ashdod, including their towns: near the place of. 47. Ashdod and all its little towns, Gaza and all its little towns, all the way to the river of Egypt, and the huge ocean, and the whole border of it: 48. Also, up in the mountains, there are Shamir, Jattir, and Socoh, 49. And also Dannah and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir, 50. And Anab, like, Eshtemoh, and Anim, ya know? 51. So there were these places called Goshen, Holon, and Giloh—like, eleven cities with all their chill little villages and stuff: 52. Yo, there's Arab, Dumah, and Eshean, fam. 53. And by the way, there's Janum, Bethtappuah, and Aphekah, in case you were wondering. (Oh, and Janum might also go by the name Janus, just FYI.) 54. And also Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is like Hebron, and Zior; there's like nine cities and their chill villages: 55. Yo, there's Maon, Carmel, Ziph, and Juttah! 56. And like, there's Jezreel, Jokdeam, and Zanoah, you know? 57. For real, these are the cities and towns: Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; a whole ten of them to be exact! 58. Yo, Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor, 59. And there were like these cities, you know? Maarath, Bethanoth, and Eltekon, bro. There were like six cities, each with their own dope villages and all that. 60. Kirjathbaal, also known as Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah, were like, these two lit cities with all their surrounding villages, you know? 61. Out in the middle of nowhere, we've got Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah. 62. And there's Nibshan, the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with all their villages and stuff. 63. So, like, the people of Judah, they weren't able to fully kick out the Jebusites who were living in Jerusalem, you know? So, the Jebusites ended up living alongside the people of Judah in Jerusalem up until today. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 151. {This} then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; {even} to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward {was} the uttermost part of the south coast. 2. And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward: {bay: Heb. tongue} 3. And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa: {Maalehacrebbim: or, the going up to Acrabbim} 4. {From thence} it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast. 5. And the east border {was} the salt sea, {even} unto the end of Jordan. And {their} border in the north quarter {was} from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan: 6. And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben: 7. And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that {is} before the going up to Adummim, which {is} on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel: 8. And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same {is} Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that {lieth} before the valley of Hinnom westward, which {is} at the end of the valley of the giants northward: 9. And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which {is} Kirjathjearim: 10. And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which {is} Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah: 11.

And the west border {was} to the great sea, and the coast {thereof}. This {is} the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families. 13. And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, {even} the city of Arba the father of Anak, which {city is} Hebron. {the city...: or, Kirjatharba} 14. And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak. 15. And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before {was} Kirjathsepher. 16. And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 17. And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 18. And it came to pass, as she came {unto him}, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off {her} ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou? 19. Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs. 20.

      "Gen Z: Joshua 161. So, the land that was given to the descendants of Joseph extended from the Jordan River near Jericho, all the way to the eastern boundary of the water of Jericho. It included the wilderness that goes up from Jericho and throughout Mount Bethel. 2. Then they leave Bethel and head towards Luz, and continue on to the outskirts of Archi, reaching Ataroth. 3. And heads towards the sunset, reaching the Japhleti region, all the way to Bethhoron the lower and Gezer. And it ends at the sea. 4. So, like, Joseph's kids, Manasseh and Ephraim, got their piece of the pie. 5. The territory that belonged to the fam of Ephraim went like this: starting from Atarothaddar on the east, all the way to Bethhoron the upper 6. And the border kept going towards the ocean to Michmethah up north; then it turned eastwards and reached Taanathshiloh, passing by it on the east to Janohah; 7. It moved from Janohah to Ataroth, then to Naarath, and eventually reached Jericho, exiting at Jordan. 8. The border went from Tappuah towards the west all the way to the river Kanah, and it extends to the sea. This is the land that belongs to the tribe of Ephraim, inherited by their families. 9. So, like, the cities for the Ephraim fam were, ya know, part of the land given to the Manasseh fam, with all the cities and villages and stuff. 10. So, like, they totally didn't kick out those Canaanites who were living in Gezer. And get this, the Canaanites are still hanging around with the Ephraimites to this day, and they're basically paying them tribute and stuff. \n",

And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was {thus}: even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper; 6. And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah; 7. And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan. 8. The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This {is} the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families. 9. And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim {were} among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. 10. And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 171. The tribe of Manasseh got a big chunk too, since Manasseh was the oldest son of Joseph. Specifically, Machir, the oldest son of Manasseh and the guy who knew his way around a battle, scored Gilead and Bashan as his territories. 2. There was some land left for the rest of the kids from Manasseh's fam: for Abiezer's crew, Helek's squad, Asriel's peeps, Shechem's crew, Hepher's gang, and Shemida's posse. These were the boys from Manasseh, Joseph's son, reppin' their fams. (Abiezer was also known as Jeezer.) 3. Yo, listen up! Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, didn't have any bros, but check this out - he had five sisters! Their names are Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 4. So they went up to Eleazar the priest and Joshua, son of Nun, and the leaders, and said, 'Yo, the LORD told Moses to give us a piece of the land with our peeps. So, as the LORD commanded, he hooked them up with an inheritance just like their dad's homies got.' 5. And Manasseh got ten parts, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Jordan River; 6. So, like, the girls from Manasseh also got their piece of the inheritance, alongside the dudes. And the other sons of Manasseh, they got the land of Gilead, you know. 7. The territory of Manasseh went from Asher to Michmethah, which is in front of Shechem. The border continued on the right side toward the people of Entappuah. 8. So, Manasseh had this place called Tappuah, but it turns out that Tappuah was kinda in the territory of Manasseh, but it actually belonged to the cool kids, the children of Ephraim. 9. And the boundary went down to the Kanah River, south of the river. These cities of Ephraim are part of the cities of Manasseh. The boundary of Manasseh was also on the north side of the river, and it extended to the sea. (Kanah River means a trendy reed-filled stream) 10. Like, the southern part belonged to Ephraim, and the northern part was like, totally Manasseh's territory, and the coast was their boundary. And they all like, connected in Asher in the north, and in Issachar in the east, you know? 11. Manasseh had Bethshean and the surrounding towns in Issachar and Asher. He also had Ibleam and the surrounding towns, as well as Dor and the surrounding towns, Endor and the surrounding towns, Taanach and the surrounding towns, and Megiddo and the surrounding towns. That's like, three whole countries, dude. 12. But, like, the Manasseh kids totally couldn't kick out the peeps living in those cities, ya know? The Canaanites just stayed chillin' in the land and stuff. 13. So basically, when the Israelites got super strong, they made the Canaanites pay up, but they didn't completely kick them out of their land. 14. So like, the kids of Joseph were talking to Joshua and they were like, 'Dude, why did you only give us one piece of land? We're a massive tribe, man! God has blessed us so much till now!' 15. Yo, Joshua was like, if y'all think you're so big and powerful, then head on up to the forested areas and start choppin' down trees in the land of the Perizzites and giants. If Mount Ephraim ain't spacious enough for ya, that is. (Giants, aka Rephaims for them nerds out there) 16. The Joseph squad was like, yo this hill ain't cutting it for us. Plus, the Canaanite crew in the valley got some sick iron chariots. You know, the peeps from Bethshean and Jezreel? They're legit. 17. Joshua talked to the fam of Joseph, including Ephraim and Manasseh, and he was like, 'Yo, you guys are legit amazing, with mad strength. You ain't gonna settle for just one portion alone, fam.' 18. But dude, you totally get to have that mountain! It's all forested and stuff, so you can totally chop it down. And yeah, all the surrounding areas are yours too. You're gonna kick out those Canaanites, even though they've got like iron chariots and are pretty tough. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 171. There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he {was} the firstborn of Joseph; {to wit}, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan. 2. There was also {a lot} for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these {were} the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families. {Abiezer: also called, Jeezer} 3. But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these {are} the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 4. And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father. 5. And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which {were} on the other side Jordan; 6. Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead. 7. And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that {lieth} before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah. 8. {Now} Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh {belonged} to the children of Ephraim; 9. And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the river: these cities of Ephraim {are} among the cities of Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also {was} on the north side of the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea: {river Kanah: or, brook of reeds} 10. Southward {it was} Ephraim's, and northward {it was} Manasseh's, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east. 11. And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, {even} three countries. 12. Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out {the inhabitants of} those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. 13. Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out. 14. And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me {but} one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I {am} a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto? 15. And Joshua answered them, If thou {be} a great people, {then} get thee up to the wood {country}, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee. {giants: or, Rephaims} 16. And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, {both they} who {are} of Bethshean and her towns, and {they} who {are} of the valley of Jezreel. 17. And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, {even} to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou {art} a great people, and hast great power: thou shalt not have one lot {only}: 18. But the mountain shall be thine; for it {is} a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, {and} though they {be} strong. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 181. So like, all the children of Israel got together at Shiloh, and they totally set up the tabernacle over there. And yeah, the land was totally under their control. 2. So, like, there were still seven tribes among the kids of Israel who hadn't gotten their share yet, you know? 3. Yo, Joshua was like, guys, what's with the delay in takin' over the promised land the Lord God gave our ancestors? 4. Yo, choose three homies from each tribe and I'll send them to check out the land. They gotta roam around and take notes on the different territories that belong to them. And then they'll come back to report to me. 5. And they gotta split it up into seven parts: Judah gonna chill in the south, and the tribe of Joseph gonna chill in the north. 6. So, like, divide the land into seven sections and bring the description to me, so I can draw lots for you right here, in front of the LORD our God. 7. Yo, listen up! The Levites don't get a piece of the action like everyone else. They got the priesthood of the LORD as their inheritance. As for Gad, Reuben, and half of Manasseh's tribe, they scored their inheritance on the east side of the Jordan River, thanks to Moses, the servant of the LORD. 8. So then, the dudes got up and bounced: and Joshua told them, those who were about to explore the land, he said, 'Yo, go and take a stroll through the land, check it out, and come back to me, so I can flip a coin for you in front of the LORD in Shiloh.' 9. So the guys went and traveled around the land, checking out each city and writing down their observations in a book. Then they headed back to Joshua and the crew in Shiloh. 10. So Joshua was like, 'Hey guys, let's cast lots in Shiloh. We gotta figure out how to divide up this land amongst the Israelite peeps, you know, following the Lord's plan and all.' 11. So, the tribe of Benjamin, like, got their portion of land based on their families. And their land was, like, right between the land of Judah and Joseph's tribe, you know? 12. On the northern side, their territory stretched from the Jordan River all the way up to the outskirts of Jericho in the north. From there, it extended through the mountains towards the west, reaching the wilderness of Bethaven. 13. Then the border went from there towards Luz, to the side of Luz, which is Bethel, going south; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that is on the south side of the lower Bethhoron. 14. And then they marked the border and went around the corner of the sea towards the south, starting from the hill in front of Bethhoron, going all the way to Kirjathbaal, also known as Kirjathjearim, a city belonging to the children of Judah. This marked the western boundary. 15. Yo, so the southern part, right, it started from Kirjathjearim and went all the way to the west, reaching the well of waters of Nephtoah, you know? 16. And the border went all the way to the edge of the mountain in front of the cool valley where the giant dudes live up north, then went down to the valley next to the city of those peeps called Jebusi on the south, and went all the way down to Enrogel. 17. Then it headed north, making its way to Enshemesh and continuing towards Geliloth, which is right by the Adummim pass. Finally, it descended to the stone of Bohan, Reuben's son. 18. And moved towards the area opposite Arabah to the north, and descended to Arabah: {Arabah: or, the plain} 19. Then the border went along the side of Bethhoglah towards the north, and it ended at the northern part of the salt sea in the south of Jordan River. That was the southern boundary. (bay means tongue in Hebrew) 20. And Jordan was, like, the boundary on the east side. This was the land the children of Benjamin got, you know, with their families spread all around it. 21. So, like, the cities that belonged to the tribe of Benjamin were totally Jericho, Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz. 22. And like, there's Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel, ya know? 23. And like, there's Avim, Parah, and Ophrah, ya know? 24. And there were like, Chepharhaammonai, Ophni, and Gaba, you know? They were all like, twelve cities and stuff, and they had, like, their own villages too, you know? 25. Bruh, Gibeon, Ramah, and Beeroth, 26. And like, Mizpeh, Chephirah, and Mozah, y'know? 27. And like, there was also Rekem and Irpeel and Taralah, you know? 28. And also Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which we now call Jerusalem, Gibeath, and Kirjath; a total of fourteen cities with all their surrounding areas. So, basically, that's what the children of Benjamin got as their property, based on their different families. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 181. And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there. And the land was subdued before them. 2. And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes, which had not yet received their inheritance. 3. And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long {are} ye slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath given you? 4. Give out from among you three men for {each} tribe: and I will send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come {again} to me. 5. And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their coasts on the north. 6. Ye shall therefore describe the land {into} seven parts, and bring {the description} hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before the LORD our God. 7. But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD {is} their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them. 8. And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh. 9. And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven parts in a book, and came {again} to Joshua to the host at Shiloh. 10. And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to their divisions. 11. And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph. 12. And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven. 13. And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of Luz, which {is} Bethel, southward; and the border descended to Atarothadar, near the hill that {lieth} on the south side of the nether Bethhoron. 14. And the border was drawn {thence}, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that {lieth} before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which {is} Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this {was} the west quarter. 15. And the south quarter {was} from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of Nephtoah: 16. And the border came down to the end of the mountain that {lieth} before the valley of the son of Hinnom, {and} which {is} in the valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel, 17. And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and went forth toward Geliloth, which {is} over against the going up of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben, 18. And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward, and went down unto Arabah: {Arabah: or, the plain} 19. And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this {was} the south coast. {bay: Heb. tongue} 20. And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This {was} the inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round about, according to their families. 21. Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley of Keziz, 22. And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel, 23. And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah, 24. And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with their villages: 25. Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth, 26. And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah, 27. And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah, 28. And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which {is} Jerusalem, Gibeath, {and} Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This {is} the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their families. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 191. So, like, the next group, right, it was the tribe of Simeon. They got their land, you know, according to their families and stuff. And get this, their turf was actually inside the land that belonged to the children of Judah. 2. And they got Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah as their slice of land, 3. And like, Hazarshual, Balah, and Azem, 4. And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah, were like, totally part of the deal, ya know? 5. And like, Ziklag, Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah, ya know? 6. And like, there were also Bethlebaoth and Sharuhen, you know? Like, a total of thirteen cities and their villages, all chillin' together, you feel me? 7. Yo, check it out, there's Ain, Remmon, Ether, and Ashan, four lit cities with all their chill vibes and cozy villages: 8. And all the towns that were nearby these cities, up to Baalathbeer and Ramath in the south. This is the land that belongs to the Simeon tribe and is passed down to their families. 9. So, basically, the kids from Judah had a lot of land, too much for them to handle. That's why the kids from Simeon got some of their land as their own inheritance, you know, within that whole setup. 10. So, the next thing that happened was Zebulun's turn. They drew the third lot, and it was all about their families. Their inheritance went all the way to Sarid, marking their border. 11. And they went up towards the ocean, and Maralah and extended to Dabbasheth, and extended to the river in front of Jokneam; 12. And it went from Sarid towards the east, where the sun rises, all the way to the border of Chislothtabor. Then it continues on to Daberath and ascends to Japhia. 13. And then it goes towards the east to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and ends at Remmonmethoar near Neah; {methoar: or, which is drawn} 14. And on the north side, it goes around to Hannathon, and ends in the valley of Jiphthahel. 15. And like, there were Kattath, Nahallal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem, y'know? Like, these were twelve chill cities along with their villages. 16. This is what the squad of Zebulun peeps get as their legacy, you know? These lit cities and all their chill villages, fam. 17. And then, like, the fourth pick was Issachar, you know? Like, they got the land and stuff for the children of Issachar and all their fams. 18. Their turf extended towards Jezreel, Chesulloth, and Shunem, 19. And like, Hapharaim, and Shion, and Anaharath, 20. And I also found Rabbith, Kishion, and Abez, 21. And also Remeth, Engannim, Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez; 22. And the area extends to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the boundary of their region extended to the Jordan River: sixteen cities along with their suburbs. 23. This is what the tribe of Issachar got as their inheritance, like, based on their families and stuff - you know, the cities and villages they got. 24. And like, the fifth lot was like chosen for the tribe of Asher, you know, for their fams and stuff. 25. And their area was like Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph, 26. And don't forget Alammelech, Amad, and Misheal; the vibe even extends all the way to Carmel in the west and Shihorlibnath. 27. Then it goes eastwards to Bethdagon, and extends to Zebulun and the valley of Jiphthahel on the north side of Bethemek. It also includes Neiel and ends at Cabul on the left side. 28. And Hebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, all the way to the awesome city of Zidon; 29. And then the shoreline goes towards Ramah and the cool city Tyre. It also goes towards Hosah, and its borders reach all the way to the sea, extending from the coast to Achzib. 30. Oh, by the way, there were also Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob – a total of twenty-two cities with their villages. 31. So basically, this is what the tribe of Asher gets as their inheritance. It's all about these cool cities and their nearby villages that belong to them. 32. So the next spot was given to the Naphtali crew, to the Naphtali fam, just keepin' it in the fam. 33. And their territory extended from Heleph to Allon, Zaanannim, Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, all the way to Lakum, and its borders reached the Jordan River. 34. Then the coastline goes westward to Aznothtabor, and continues to Hukkok, reaching Zebulun on the southern side, extending to Asher on the western side, and to Judah by the Jordan River towards the sunrise. 35. And these are the fortified cities: Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth, 36. Yo, check out Adamah, Ramah, and Hazor, 37. And like, there were also Kedesh, Edrei, and Enhazor, ya know? 38. And like, there were these dope cities man, like Iron, Migdalel, Horem, Bethanath, and Bethshemesh, yo! It's like, a total of nineteen chill cities with their cozy villages, you know? 39. This is what the tribe of Naphtali gets as their inheritance. It includes cities and villages for each of their families. 40. So, like, the last tribe to get their territory was Dan, you know? It was all planned out, according to their fams and stuff. 41. So, their turf included Zorah, Eshtaol, and Irshemesh, 42. And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah, 43. And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron, 44. And like, there were also Eltekeh, Gibbethon, and Baalath, 45. And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon, fam! 46. And Mejarkon and Rakkon were like, right near Japho. Like, they were right across from it or something. But you know, Japho is also called Joppa. 47. So, like, the land that the tribe of Dan got was, like, not enough for them. So, they were like, 'we need more!' And they went and fought against Leshem and totally won. They went all sword-fighting mode and took over Leshem, living there and naming it Dan, after their dad Dan. 48. So, like, this is what the tribe of Dan got as their inheritance, you know, for their fams and stuff. It's a bunch of cities and villages and all that. 49. Once they finished dividing up the land for everyone to inherit, the kids of Israel hooked up Joshua, son of Nun, with some prime real estate too: 50. So, like, because God said it, they gave him the city he wanted, ya know, Timnathserah in mount Ephraim. And he, like, totally built the city and lived there. 51. Yo, check it out, these are the lands that Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the leaders of the tribes of Israel divided up as inheritances. They did it by drawing lots in Shiloh, right in front of the LORD's crib, aka the tabernacle. And that's how they wrapped it up, all the land got divided and stuff. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 191. And the second lot came forth to Simeon, {even} for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of Judah. 2.

Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages. 31. This {is} the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages. 32.

And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their villages. 39. This {is} the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages. 40. {And} the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families. 41. And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh, 42. And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah, 43. And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron, 44. And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath, 45. And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon, 46. And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho. {before: or, over against} {Japho: or, Joppa} 47. And the coast of the children of Dan went out {too little} for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father. 48. This {is} the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages. 49. When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them: 50. According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, {even} Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein. 51. These {are} the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 201. Yo, the LORD straight up talked to Joshua like, 2. Yo, listen up, Israelites! God's got a message for y'all. He wants you to choose some safe havens, like cities of refuge, just like He told Moses before. 3. If someone accidentally takes someone's life without realizing it, they can go to those designated places and find safety from the one seeking revenge. 4. So, like, when someone runs to one of those cool cities, they gotta go to the entrance and talk to the wise old heads of the city about what's up. And if they find out it's legit, they'll totally let them stay in the city and hook them up with a place to live. How rad is that? 5. And if someone seeking vengeance comes after them, they shouldn't hand over the person who killed accidentally and had no previous hatred towards them. 6. And he'll live in that city until he appears before the gang for a decision, until the high priest who is in charge during that time dies. Then the one who accidentally caused someone's death can go back to their hometown, their own house, to the city they ran away from. 7. So they set up Kedesh in Galilee on Mount Naphtali, and Shechem on Mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba (also known as Hebron) in the hills of Judah. 8. And on the other side of the Jordan, by Jericho in the east, they designated Bezer in the middle of nowhere, from the Reuben tribe, Ramoth in Gilead from the Gad tribe, and Golan in Bashan from the Manasseh tribe. 9. These were the cities set for all the Israel fam, and for any out-of-towner chillin' with them. If anyone accidentally takes a life, they can book it to these cities and dodge gettin' murked by the revenge squad, until they face the community court. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 201. The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying, 2. Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of Moses: 3. That the slayer that killeth {any} person unawares {and} unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood. 4. And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place, that he may dwell among them. 5. And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime. 6. And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, {and} until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled. 7. And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which {is} Hebron, in the mountain of Judah. {appointed: Heb. sanctified} 8. And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh. 9. These were the cities appointed for all the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that whosoever killeth {any} person at unawares might flee thither, and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood before the congregation. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 211. After that, the top dudes from the Levites, the fathers of the gangs, slid up to Eleazar the priest and Joshua, son of Nun. They also spoke to the big shots from the tribes of Israel. 2. So like, they were talking to them at Shiloh in Canaan, and they were all like, 'Yo, the LORD totally commanded through Moses that we need some cities to live in, you know? Plus, we gotta have suburbs for our cattle, 'cause they need space too. 3. So, like, the peeps of Israel gave the Levites some of their land, because the Lord said so, ya know? These cities and their chill neighborhoods, all given to the Levites. 4. And they drew lots for the Kohathite families: and the kids of Aaron, who were from the Levites, got assigned cities through the lottery from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin - a total of thirteen cities. 5. So, the rest of the kids from the Kohath crew got their spots in the city lottery. Some ended up in Ephraim's tribe, others in Dan's, and a few in the half tribe of Manasseh. We're talking a total of ten cities for them. 6. So, the Gershonites were given thirteen cities through lots, from the families of the tribe of Issachar, the tribe of Asher, the tribe of Naphtali, and the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan. 7. So the kids from the Merari crew, from the Reuben fam, from the Gad squad, and from the Zebulun tribe, scored themselves twelve lit cities. 8. So, like, the Israelites were all like, drawing lots and stuff, to assign these cities with their surrounding areas to the Levites. And yeah, they were just following the instructions that the LORD gave through Moses, you know? 9. Okay, so they picked some cities from the tribes of Judah and Simeon. These are the ones they mentioned by name, you know? 10. The kids of Aaron, from the cool fams of the Kohathites, who were from the tribe of Levi, had this swaggy possession. It was like, the sickest thing ever, 'cause they got the top spot. 11. So they let them have the city of Arba, Anak's dad, which is Hebron, up in the hills of Judah, along with all the cool surrounding areas. (Or, you could say, Kirjatharba) 12. Bruh, they straight up hooked Caleb, son of Jephunneh, up with the fields and villages of the city as his own property. No cap. 13. So they hooked up the priest Aaron's crew with Hebron and its chill surroundings, making it a safe spot for people who accidentally took a life. Libnah and its chill surroundings were also part of the deal. 14. And Jattir, like, the whole gang's there, and Eshtemoa, you know, with all its chill surroundings, 15. And Holon, you know, and all the chill suburbs around it, and Debir, which is also known as Hilen and stuff, with its suburbs. 16. And Ain, you know, with all its chill suburbs, and Juttah, like, with its rad suburbs, and oh yeah, Bethshemesh with its epic suburbs; a total of nine cities from those two tribes. Ain, by the way, is also known as Ashan. 17. And from the tribe of Benjamin, we had Gibeon and its nearby areas, Geba (also known as Gaba) and its nearby areas. 18. So there were four cities: Anathoth and its suburbs, Almon (also known as Alemeth) and its suburbs. 19. So, like, all the cities that belonged to Aaron's crew, the priests, were a total of thirteen cities and their chill outskirts. 20. So, like, the Kohathites, who were from the tribe of Levi, y'know, they were given cities to live in that were in the land belonging to the tribe of Ephraim. 21. They gave Shechem and its surrounding areas in mount Ephraim as a safe haven for the person who accidentally killed someone; and also Gezer with its surrounding areas. 22. And like, Kibzaim was totally there with its chill neighborhoods, along with Bethhoron and its suburbs, making it a total of four hip cities. 23. And from the tribe of Dan, we got Eltekeh and Gibbethon, along with all their chill neighborhoods. 24. Aijalon, chillin' with her crew, Gathrimmon, kickin' it with her posse; four sick cities. 25. And from the half tribe of Manasseh, we've got Tanach and her surrounding areas, and Gathrimmon with her surrounding areas; two cities in total. 26. So, like, all the cities, ya know, there were ten of 'em, and they had these cool suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that were still around. 27. And to the Gershon crew, from the Levite fams, reppin' half of Manasseh, they hooked up Golan in Bashan with its hood, as a safe zone for a homie who accidentally killed someone; and Beeshterah with its hood too, two chill cities. 28. From the Issachar fam, we got Kishon with its chill neighborhoods and Dabareh with its lit suburbs, 29. Jarmuth and Engannim, along with the places around them, all together make up four cool cities. 30. And from the Asher fam, we got Mishal and her crew, Abdon and his squad, 31. Helkath and its chill hangouts, and Rehob with its dope hangouts; four lit cities. 32. And Naphtali's crew claimed Kedesh in Galilee as their chill hangout spot, where you could escape the heat if you accidentally took someone out. They also had Hammothdor and Kartan as their backup venues - three happening cities in total. 33. So, like, the Gershonites had a total of thirteen cities with their suburbs, ya know, all divided according to their fams and stuff. 34. To the squad of the Merari fam, the leftover Levites from Zebulun's tribe, they got Jokneam and Kartah with their chill neighborhoods. 35. Dimnah and its surrounding areas, Nahalal and its surrounding areas, four cities. 36. And from the squad of Reuben, Bezer with its chill hangouts, and Jahazah with its trendy spots, 37. Kedemoth flexin' with its surroundings, and Mephaath be vibin' with its surroundings; a total of four lit cities. 38. And from the tribe of Gad, we got Ramoth in Gilead with its chill neighborhood, as a safe spot for someone who accidentally took a life; and Mahanaim with its cool hangout spots. 39. Heshbon and its surrounding areas, Jazer and its surrounding areas; a total of four cities. 40. So, like, all the cool cities that the peeps from the fam of Merari, you know, the leftover Levites, got assigned in, like, a lottery, were a solid twelve cities. 41. So, basically, the Israelite peeps had a total of 48 cities including the chill Levites in their hood, complete with their suburbs and all. No cap. 42. These cities had their suburbs all around them: that's how all these cities were. 43. So, like, God totally hooked up Israel with all the land that He promised to their ancestors, and they actually got to live there and make it their home, no cap. 44. And God totally hooked them up with chill vibes all around, just like He promised their parents. None of their enemies could even bring it; God totally handed over all their enemies to them. 45. God totally came through on all the awesome things He promised to the Israelites. Every single one of 'em happened, no doubt! \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 211. Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel; 2. And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle. 3. And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and their suburbs. 4. And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and the children of Aaron the priest, {which were} of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities. 5. And the rest of the children of Kohath {had} by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan, and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities. 6.

The children of Merari by their families {had} out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities. 8. And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses. 9. And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which are {here} mentioned by name, {mentioned: Heb. called} 10. Which the children of Aaron, {being} of the families of the Kohathites, {who were} of the children of Levi, had: for theirs was the first lot. 11. And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which {city is} Hebron, in the hill {country} of Judah, with the suburbs thereof round about it. {the city...: or, Kirjatharba} 12. But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession. 13. Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs, 14. And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs, 15. And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs, {Holon: also called, Hilen} 16. And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, {and} Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes. {Ain: also called, Ashan} 17. And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs, Geba with her suburbs, {Geba: also called, Gaba} 18. Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities. {Almon: also called, Alemeth} 19. All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, {were} thirteen cities with their suburbs. 20. And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim. 21. For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim, {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her suburbs, 22. And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs; four cities. 23. And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs, Gibbethon with her suburbs, 24. Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four cities. 25. And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities. 26. All the cities {were} ten with their suburbs for the families of the children of Kohath that remained. 27. And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the {other} half tribe of Manasseh {they gave} Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, {to be} a city of refuge for the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities. 28.

So all the cities for the children of Merari by their families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites, were {by} their lot twelve cities. 41. All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the children of Israel {were} forty and eight cities with their suburbs. 42. These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them: thus {were} all these cities. 43. And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt therein. 44. And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand. 45. There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 221. So Joshua hit up the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the Manasseh squad (half tribe) on a group chat, 2. And like, he you know, was all like, 'Yo, you guys totally followed every single thing that Moses, the servant of the LORD, told you to do. And you like, totally listened to me too, and did everything that I told you to do. Major props, fam! 3. You haven't ditched your homies for a hot minute, and you've been loyal to keeping God's commandments. 4. Yo, fam! Check it, the LORD your God has totally hooked up your squad with some mad rest, just like He promised, ya know? So yo, it's time for all of y'all to bounce and head back to your tents and chill in the land that Moses, the servant of the LORD, hooked y'all up with on the other side of Jordan. Yeah, you got this, my dudes! 5. Yo, listen up and pay close attention to this: make sure you always follow the commandments and laws set by Moses, who was the Lord's servant. It's all about showing love and devotion to the Almighty, by living according to His ways, keeping His commandments, sticking with Him through thick and thin, and fully dedicating yourself to serving Him with all your heart and soul. 6. So Joshua gave them a shoutout, and let them bounce: and they went back to their crib. 7. So, like, Moses gave, you know, part of the tribe of Manasseh some land in Bashan, but Joshua gave the other half of the tribe land on this side of the Jordan in the west. And when Joshua sent them back to their homes, he totally blessed them. 8. And he was like, yo, go back to your tents and bring back heaps of riches. Get lots of cattle, silver, gold, brass, iron, and mad clothes too. Share the spoils of your enemies with your bros. 9. Then the squad of Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh bounced and dipped out from the fam of Israel in Shiloh, in the lit land of Canaan, to head to Gilead, their turf, as the LORD told 'em through Moses. 10. So, when they reached the outskirts of Jordan, which is in Canaan, the peeps from Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh set up a sick altar by the river, and it was HUGE! 11. So, like, word got around to the Israelites that the Reubenites, Gadites, and half of the Manassites went and built this sick altar across from Canaan, near the Jordan River where the Israelites were passing through. 12. And when the Israelites found out about it, all the peeps of Israel came together at Shiloh, ready to throw down in battle against them. 13. So the Israelites hit up the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the Manasseh crew who were chilling in Gilead, and asked Phinehas, Eleazar's son and priest, to come through. 14. And he had ten squad leaders with him, one from each major household in all the tribes of Israel. Each one was the leader of their own family's house, among the thousands of Israel. 15. So they went to the kids of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh's half tribe, specifically to the land of Gilead, and had a chat with them, saying, 16. Yo, listen up fam, the whole squad of the Almighty is like, yo, what wrong move is this that y'all pulled on the big man upstairs? Why you gotta ditch Him today and go ahead building yourself some mad altar trying to start a rebellion against the big G? 17. Yo, the sin of Peor ain't just some small thing for us. We still ain't gotten rid of it, even after all this time. And check it, there was a serious plague goin' down among the Lord's crew. 18. So, are you seriously thinking about ditching the LORD today? Like, if you really rebel against the LORD today, don't even trip, 'cause tomorrow He's gonna be totally furious with the entire crew of Israel. 19. So, like, if the land you own is, like, all dirty and stuff, then you should go to the land that the Lord owns, where His tabernacle is, and, you know, settle there with us. But, like, don't go against the Lord or us by building your own altar next to the altar of our God, okay? 20. Yo, remember when Achan, Zerah's son, straight up messed up? He went and took some forbidden stuff, and because of that, the whole Israel gang got in trouble. And let me tell you, that dude didn't suffer the consequences alone for his wrongdoing. 21. So like, the kids from Reuben and Gad and like, half of Manasseh, they, you know, spoke up and were all like, 'Hey, leaders of the thousands in Israel, listen up!' 22. The super awesome God, the absolute best ever, totally knows everything, and he will totally know what's up with Israel; like, if they're rebelling or doing something against God, then don't save them today, 23. If we've made an altar to ditch following the LORD, or if we're all about those burnt offerings or fancy food offerings, or even if we offer peace offerings there, the LORD should totally call us out on it. 24. And if we didn't do it because we were scared of this situation, thinking that in the future your kids might ask our kids, 'What's your deal with the God of Israel?' 25. Because God has set the Jordan River as a boundary between us and you, Reuben and Gad's fam, you won't have any share with God. As a result, your kids will influence our kids to stop revering God. 26. So, we were like, yo, let's get ready to build an altar, but not for like, burning stuff or making sacrifices or whatever: 27. So that it becomes like a receipt for all of us, you, and all the people who come after us. This way, we can show that we're doing our part for the LORD by making our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings. This is to make sure that your kids don't diss our kids later and say they don't have any connection to the LORD. 28. So we were like, okay, here's the deal: in the future, when people ask us or our peeps about it, we can totally show them the altar blueprint that our dads made. But, just FYI, it's not for burning stuff or sacrifices. It's more like a symbol of the bond between us and you guys. 29. No way we're gonna dis the LORD and ditch Him today, just to set up our own altar for offerings and sacrifices, like seriously, bro, right next to the LORD's altar in front of His crib. 30. So, like, Phinehas, the priest dude, and the cool leaders of the Israel gang, heard what the peeps from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh were saying, and they were totally down with it. It was like, good vibes all around, ya know? 31. Yo, Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, straight up told the peeps from Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, that today we can totally tell that the LORD is with us, because you didn't go and mess up by doing something against the LORD. So basically, you've like totally saved the children of Israel from the hand of the LORD. Like, for real. 32. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, along with the bosses, came back from hanging out with the peeps from Reuben and Gad in Gilead and went back to Canaan to give the children of Israel the latest news. 33. The Israelites were totally cool with it, and they gave major props to God. They had no plans to start a fight and wreck the land where the peeps from Reuben and Gad were living. 34. So, like, the kids of Reuben and Gad named the altar 'Ed' because it's supposed to, like, symbolize that the LORD is our God and, you know, it's, like, a legit testimony and stuff. 'Ed' means, like, a witness and all. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 221. Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, 2. And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you: 3. Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God. 4. And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, {and} unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan. 5. But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. 6. So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents. 7. Now to the {one} half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given {possession} in Bashan: but unto the {other} half thereof gave Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them, 8. And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. 9. And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which {is} in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 10. And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that {are} in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to. 11. And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel. 12. And when the children of Israel heard {of it}, the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them. 13. And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, 14. And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one {was} an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel. {chief...: Heb. house of the father} 15. And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of Gilead, and they spake with them, saying, 16. Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass {is} this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD? 17. {Is} the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD, 18. But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, {seeing} ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of Israel. 19. Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession {be} unclean, {then} pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD'S tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God. 20. Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity. 21. Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel, 22. The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if {it be} in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,) 23. That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require {it}; 24. And if we have not {rather} done it for fear of {this} thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel? {In time...: Heb. To morrow} 25. For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD. 26. Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice: 27. But {that} it {may be} a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD. 28. Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should {so} say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say {again}, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it {is} a witness between us and you. 29. God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that {is} before his tabernacle. 30. And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which {were} with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them. {pleased...: Heb. was good in their eyes} 31. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD {is} among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the LORD. {now: Heb. then} 32. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again. 33. And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt. 34. And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar {Ed}: for it {shall be} a witness between us that the LORD {is} God. {Ed: that is, A witness} \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 231. So, like, a really long time passed after the LORD gave Israel a break from all their enemies that were causing trouble, and Joshua, he got old and everything, like really old. 2. So Joshua gathered all the fam of Israel, including the OGs, the leaders, the judges, and the squad, and he was like, 'Y'all, I've been around the block, and I'm getting up there in years.' 3. And you've witnessed all the sick moves the LORD your God pulled on all those nations because of you; 'cause the LORD your God is the one who's been rocking it out for you. 4. Yo fam, listen up. I've split these leftover nations among y'all by drawing lots, so you can claim 'em as your inheritance for each tribe. It's from the Jordan River, all the way to the west, where I've wiped out all the other nations. #sunsetvibes #blessed 5. And God, like, totally gonna kick them outta here, get them outta your sight, and you'll totally have their land just like God promised you. 6. So, like, you gotta be super brave and committed to doing everything that's written in the book of the law of Moses, ya know? Don't stray off course to the right or left, just stay focused and stay strong! 7. Don't hang out with these other nations that are still around you. Don't even talk about their gods or swear by them. Don't worship them or bow down to them. 8. Stay loyal to the LORD your God, just like you've been all along. {Stay loyal...: or, If you stay loyal... etc} 9. Yo, God totally kicked out all those big and strong nations for you. And, like, no one could even stand up to you up until now. It's legit impressive, bro! 10. Listen up, fam! Just one of you can straight up flex on a whole thousand peeps. Why? 'Cause the almighty LORD, your God, is the one who's got your back and fights for you, just like He promised. Periodt. 11. So, like, make sure you're super careful to love the LORD your God with all your soul, okay? 12. But if y'all go and cling to the leftover nations that are still around, getting hitched and all with them, and, you know, doing the dirty together... 13. Yo fam, just wanna make sure you get this straight. The big man upstairs, aka the LORD your God, ain't gonna kick out any of those nations in front of you no more. Instead, they're gonna be like straight-up traps and whips on your back, poking you in the eyes like mad thorns, until you straight up vanish from this amazing land the LORD your God hooked you up with. 14. Yo, listen up! Today, I'm about to do what everyone eventually does and leave this world. But deep down, in your hearts and souls, you know that every single amazing thing that the LORD your God promised has totally come true. Not one of those things has fallen through the cracks or been left undone. 15. So, basically, here's the deal: just like all the cool stuff that God promised would happen to you actually happened, now it's time for the not-so-cool stuff. God's gonna bring some not-so-fun things your way until you're completely wiped out of this awesome land that God hooked you up with. 16. If you break the deal with the LORD your God that he told you to follow by worshiping other gods and bowing down to them, it's gonna make the LORD really mad and you'll disappear real fast from the awesome land he gave to you. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 231. And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that Joshua waxed old {and} stricken in age. {stricken...: Heb. come into days} 2. And Joshua called for all Israel, {and} for their elders, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old {and} stricken in age: 3. And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God {is} he that hath fought for you. 4. Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward. {westward: Heb. at the sunset} 5. And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you. 6. Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom {to} the right hand or {to} the left; 7. That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear {by them}, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them: 8. But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day. {But cleave...: or, For if ye will cleave, etc} 9. For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but {as for} you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day. {For the LORD...: or, Then the LORD will drive} 10. One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he {it is} that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you. 11. Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God. {yourselves: Heb. your souls} 12. Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, {even} these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you: 13. Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out {any of} these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you. 14. And, behold, this day I {am} going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, {and} not one thing hath failed thereof. 15. Therefore it shall come to pass, {that} as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you. 16. When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you. \n",
      "Gen Z: Joshua 241. So Joshua brought together all the groups of Israel to Shechem and summoned the OGs, the top dogs, the judges, and the officials. And they all showed up to flex in front of God. 2. Joshua was like, 'Yo, everyone listen up. This is what the LORD God of Israel says: Your ancestors lived on the other side of this huge river a long time ago. We're talking about Terah, Abraham's dad, and Nachor's dad too. And they were into worshipping other gods and stuff. 3. So, like, I totally picked your dad Abraham from across the big flood and guided him all over Canaan, yo! And, no cap, I made his fam grow like crazy and blessed him with a son named Isaac. 4. So, like, I gave Isaac two sons, Jacob and Esau. And then I gave Esau this awesome place called mount Seir to own, ya know? But Jacob and his crew ended up heading down to Egypt for some reason. 5. So, Moses and Aaron were totally sent by me, and I totally wrecked Egypt with all the crazy stuff I did there. But don't worry, after that chaotic adventure, I totally rescued you all and brought you out of there. 6. So, like, I totally rescued your ancestors from Egypt, and you guys were at the sea, right? And guess what, the Egyptians were all like, chasing your ancestors with their fancy chariots and horsemen, until they reached the Red Sea. Crazy, right?! 7. And when they hit up the LORD, he flexed and made it dark between you and the Egyptians, and straight up brought the sea on them, and covered them up real good; and you saw with your own eyes the epic stuff I did in Egypt: and y'all chilled in the wilderness for a hot minute. 8. So, I took you to this place called the land of the Amorites, on the other side of the Jordan River. They tried to fight with you, but I totally handed their butts over to you, so you could claim their land as your own. And guess what? I straight-up destroyed them right in front of you. No competition. 9. So, like, this dude Balak, son of Zippor, who was the king of Moab, got all up in arms and started a fight against Israel. And then he was all like, 'Yo, Balaam, son of Beor, I need you to curse these guys for me!' 10. But I didn't listen to Balaam, so he still ended up blessing you. That's how I saved you from his grasp. 11. So you crossed the Jordan River and arrived in Jericho, and the people of Jericho straight-up battled against you. They were like, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But yo, I totally handed them over to you. Like, mission accomplished. 12. I totally unleashed a swarm of killer hornets on those dudes, straight up kicking them outta your way. And get this—those two Amorite kings? Yeah, I didn't even need you to bust out your sword or bow. They were toast without 'em, no cap. 13. So basically, I hooked you up with this awesome land that you didn't even bust your butt for. You got cities that you didn't even have to build, and now you're chilling in them. You're chowing down on vineyards and olive groves that you didn't even bother planting. Enjoy the fruits of my labor, fam! 14. So listen up, fam. It's time to show some respect to the LORD and serve Him with mad authenticity and honesty. We gotta ditch all those idols that our ancestors used to worship back in the day, whether it was across the land or in Egypt. It's all about repping the LORD now, straight up. 15. If you're not feeling down with serving the LORD, it's all good, you do you! Decide right now who you wanna serve - the gods your ancestors worshipped back in the day, or the gods of the Amorites whose land you're chillin' in. But for me and my crew, we're stickin' with the LORD. 16. And the people were like, no way, we ain't giving up on the LORD to worship other gods! 17. Like, dude, the LORD our God totally brought us and our ancestors out of Egypt, you know? We were trapped and stuff, but God did all these epic miracles right in front of us. He totally watched over us the whole time we were wandering, even when we encountered all these different groups of people. 18. And, like, God totally kicked out all those people, ya know, the Amorites who were living in the land. So, yeah, we're totally gonna serve the LORD 'cause He's our God, no doubt! 19. And Joshua was like, listen up, folks, there's no way we can serve the LORD, because He's, like, super holy and, yeah, He's a bit of a jealous God too. So, don't expect Him to just forgive all your mistakes and sins, 'cause that's not how He rolls. Just so you know, holy God in Hebrew is like holy Gods or something. 20. If you ditch the LORD and start simping for random gods, he's gonna ghost you and mess you up real bad, even after he's been super good to you. 21. And the peeps were like, 'Nah, Joshua, we got you. We're gonna stay loyal and serve the LORD.' 22. And Joshua was like, listen up guys, you totally know that you chose the LORD to be your main one. And the people were like, yup, we totally know. We're witnesses and all. 23. So yeah, get rid of those weird gods you've got hanging around, and like, focus your heart on the LORD God of Israel. 24. And the squad was like, yo Joshua, we're down to serve the LORD our God and totally follow his voice, no doubt. 25. And Joshua, like, totally made a pact with the people that day, and, like, gave them some rules and instructions in Shechem. 26. So Joshua wrote down these words in the sacred book of God's law, and placed a massive rock next to the holy place of the Lord. 27. So Joshua was like, yo, listen up fam! This stone right here, it's gonna be our witness. It's heard everything the Lord has said to us. So, don't even try to deny your God, 'cause this stone's got the receipts and it's gonna testify for us. 28. So Joshua was like, 'Alright guys, you're free to bounce and go back to your own lands.' 29. So, like, after all that happened, Joshua, who's the son of Nun and a total servant of the LORD, passed away at the ripe age of 110. 30. And they laid him to rest in Timnathserah, which was in the mountains of Ephraim, on the chill north side of the hill of Gaash. 31. So, like, Israel totally dedicated themselves to the LORD throughout the whole time Joshua was in charge. And even after Joshua and the OG elders passed away, the ones who witnessed all the epic things the LORD did for Israel, they still stayed faithful. Can you believe it? That's just mind-blowing, man. 32. The Israelites took Joseph's bones up from Egypt and buried them in Shechem, on a piece of land that Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor (Shechem's dad) for a hundred silver coins. This spot became the property of Joseph's descendants. (The coins could also be called lambs, just so you know.) 33. So Eleazar, Aaron's son, passed away and they laid him to rest on a hill that Phinehas, his son, got in Mount Ephraim. \n",
      "KJV: Joshua 241. And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before God. 2. And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time, {even} Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods. 3. And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac. 4. And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt. 5. I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out. 6. And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea. 7. And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season. 8. And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you. 9. Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you: 10. But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand. 11. And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand. 12. And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from before you, {even} the two kings of the Amorites; {but} not with thy sword, nor with thy bow. 13. And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat. 14. Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD. 15. And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that {were} on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD. 16. And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods; 17. For the LORD our God, he {it is} that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed: 18. And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: {therefore} will we also serve the LORD; for he {is} our God. 19. And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for he {is} an holy God; he {is} a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins. {holy God: Heb. holy Gods} 20. If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good. 21. And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the LORD. 22. And Joshua said unto the people, Ye {are} witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they said, {We are} witnesses. 23. Now therefore put away, {said he}, the strange gods which {are} among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel. 24. And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey. 25. So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. 26. And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that {was} by the sanctuary of the LORD. 27. And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God. 28. So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance. 29. And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, {being} an hundred and ten years old. 30. And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which {is} in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash. 31. And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel. {overlived...: Heb. prolonged their days after Joshua} 32. And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. {pieces...: or, lambs} 33. And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill {that pertained to} Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 11. So, Joshua died and the Israelite peeps were like, 'Yo, Lord, who's gonna lead us in battling the Canaanites? 2. God was like, 'Yo, Judah gonna take over. Check it out, I made him victorious over the land.' 3. And Judah was like, 'Yo, Simeon, let's team up and take on those Canaanites in my territory. And I'll totally have your back when we fight in your turf too, bro.' So Simeon was like, 'Sure thing, man. I'm down.' And they rolled together. 4. So Judah went up, and with God's help, they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. They took down a whopping ten thousand men in Bezek! 5. So they tracked down this dude Adonibezek in Bezek, and they straight up had a battle with him. And guess what? They totally wiped out those Canaanites and Perizzites! 6. So Adonibezek ran away, but they chased after him and caught him, giving him a major 'oopsie' by hacking off his thumbs and big toes. 7. Adonibezek was like, 'Bro, I had like 70 kings rollin' up to me with no thumbs and toes, beggin' for scraps under my table. And you know what? God totally gave me what I deserved. They took him to Jerusalem, and that's where he kicked the bucket, man. 8. So, like, the kids from Judah, they were totally like fighting against Jerusalem, and they actually took over the place, and like, totally attacked it with swords and set the whole city on fire. 9. And then the kids from Judah decided to go down and take on the Canaanites who were living in the mountains, down south, and in the low country. 10. So Judah totally took on those Canaanites in Hebron, like, the place used to be called Kirjatharba before, ya know? And they straight up defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. 11. Then he headed towards the people in Debir, which used to be called Kirjathsepher: 12. And Caleb was like, if anyone totally destroys Kirjathsepher and captures it, I'll totally hook them up with my daughter Achsah as their wifey. 13. So, Othniel, bro of Caleb, totally claimed it and married Achsah, his daughter. No biggie. 14. So, like, when she arrived, she convinced him to ask her dad for a piece of land, and she got off her donkey. And Caleb was all like, 'What do you want?' 15. And she was like, yo, bless me, 'cause you already hooked me up with some land down south. How 'bout you hook me up with some water too? And Caleb was like, bet, here you go - the fancy springs and the regular springs. 16. So like, the Kenite fam, who are like Moses' in-laws, they left the city with all the palm trees and teamed up with the Judah squad to head into the wild desert in Judah, down south near Arad. And they all just chilled together with the locals, y'know. 17. So Judah and Simeon rolled up together, and they straight up wiped out the Canaanites living in Zephath. They completely wrecked that city, and it was called Hormah after that. 18. So, like, Judah totally conquered Gaza and all the places nearby, like Askelon and Ekron and their surrounding areas. 19. And God was like totally on Judah's side, and they totally dominated the peeps living in the mountains. But they couldn't totally remove the peeps living in the valley 'cause they had some seriously rad iron chariots. Like, impossible to beat! 20. So they handed Hebron over to Caleb, just like Moses said, and he kicked out those three Anakite guys from there. 21. So, like, the peeps from Benjamin didn't kick out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem. They, like, decided to share the city... and, believe it or not, they're still chillin' together in Jerusalem even now! 22. And yo, the squad of Joseph was like, 'Let's go up to Bethel.' And guess what? The LORD was vibin' with them, totally on their side. 23. So, the Joseph crew decided to check out Bethel, which used to be called Luz. 24. So, like, these spies peeped this dude coming out of the city, and they were like, 'Hey, can you, like, show us how to get into the city? In return, we'll hook you up with some mercy.' 25. And when he showed them the way inside the city, they attacked the city with their swords, but they spared the man and his whole fam. 26. So this dude went to Hittite territory, founded a city, and named it Luz. And guess what? That name stuck till now. Pretty cool, huh? 27. So Manasseh didn't kick out the people living in places like Bethshean, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, and Megiddo. Instead, the Canaanites decided to stay there. 28. So, like, when Israel became all powerful, they were like, 'Okay, Canaanites, you gotta pay up,' instead of like completely kicking them out. 29. Ephraim totally slacked off when it came to kicking out those Canaanites from Gezer. Like, they didn't even bother! So guess what? The Canaanites just chilled in Gezer right alongside them. Yikes. 30. Zebulun totally didn't kick out the peeps from Kitron or Nahalol. The Canaanites just chilled with them and started paying them tribute, y'know. 31. Asher didn't fully kick out the peeps in Accho, Zidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob: 32. So, like, the Asherites were chilling with the Canaanites, you know, the people who were already living in that place. Instead of kicking them out, they's just coexisting and stuff. 33. So basically, Naphtali didn't fully kick out the people from Bethshemesh and Bethanath. Instead, he just kinda chilled with the Canaanites who already lived there. But hey, the people from Bethshemesh and Bethanath ended up having to pay tribute to them. #CantBeatEmJoinEm 34. The Amorites totally blocked the children of Dan from coming down into the valley by pressuring them to stay up in the mountain. 35. But, like, the Amorites were living in mount Heres in Aijalon and Shaalbim, you know? But the house of Joseph was totally strong and overpowering, so the Amorites ended up becoming their peeps, kinda serving them and stuff. {prevailed: like, was super powerful} 36. The Amorites controlled the area from Akrabbim and the rocky terrain, all the way up. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 11. Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them? 2. And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand. 3. And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him. 4. And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men. 5. And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 6. But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes. 7. And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered {their meat} under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died. {their thumbs...: Heb. the thumbs of their hands and of their feet} {gathered: or, gleaned} 8. Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire. 9. And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley. {valley: or, low country} 10. And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before {was} Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai. 11. And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before {was} Kirjathsepher: 12. And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 13. And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 14. And it came to pass, when she came {to him}, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off {her} ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou? 15. And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs. 16. And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which {lieth} in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people. 17. And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah. 18. Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof. 19. And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out {the inhabitants of} the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron. {drave...: or, possessed the mountain} 20. And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak. 21. And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day. 22. And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and the LORD {was} with them. 23. And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before {was} Luz.) 24. And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy. 25. And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family. 26. And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which {is} the name thereof unto this day. 27. Neither did Manasseh drive out {the inhabitants of} Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land. 28. And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out. 29. Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them. 30. Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries. 31. Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob: 32. But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out. 33. Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them. 34. And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: 35. But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries. {prevailed: Heb. was heavy} 36. And the coast of the Amorites {was} from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward. {the going...: or, Maalehacrabbim} \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 21. Yo, this angel from the LORD rolled up from Gilgal to Bochim and was like, 'I'm the one who got you outta Egypt and brought you to the land promised to your ancestors. And just FYI, I'm never gonna break my promise to you.' 2. And don't make friends with the people in this place, bros and sistas. Destroy their altars like I told you to, but you totally didn't listen to me. Like, why did you go and do that? 3. So like, I was totally like, I'm not gonna kick them out in front of you, but they're gonna be super annoying, like thorns in your sides, and their gods are gonna trap you, dude. 4. Yo, listen up, fam. So, like, this angel from the big man upstairs straight up started talking to all the Israelite homies, right? And when they heard what the angel had to say, the whole crew got mad emotional and started crying. It was a real moment, dude. 5. So they named that place Bochim, which means 'Weepers,' and they offered sacrifices to the LORD there. 6. So, like, after Joshua told the people they could go, all the Israelites went to claim their inheritance and take over the land, you know? 7. So, like, the peeps were totally down for the LORD throughout Joshua's whole reign and even after when the OG elders were still kickin'. These legends had actually witnessed all the epic stuff the LORD pulled off for Israel. Like, mad respect. 8. And Joshua, the son of Nun, who served the LORD, passed away at the age of one hundred and ten. 9. So they laid him to rest in the outskirts of his land in Timnathheres, up in the mountains of Ephraim, on the chill north side of the awesome Gaash hill. {Timnathheres: also known as Timnathserah} 10. And then all those old peeps passed away and went to join their ancestors. And a new generation came after them, who were clueless about the LORD and had no idea about the epic stuff He did for Israel. 11. So, like, the Israelites totally messed up and did some majorly uncool stuff in God's eyes. They started worshiping other gods called Baalim and stuff, not cool at all, man. 12. But, like, they totally ditched the LORD God of their ancestors, who totally saved them from Egypt, and started worshipping other gods from the people around them. They were all into these other gods and showed them major respect, which made the LORD super angry, like seriously. 13. And they totally ditched God, and started worshipping Baal and Ashtaroth. SMH. 14. The LORD was super mad at Israel and let them get wrecked by spoilers who totally messed them up. Then, he sold them out to their enemies from all sides, to the point where they couldn't even put up a fight anymore. 15. Wherever they went, the LORD made things go bad for them, just like the LORD said and promised. They were really stressed out. 16. But like, the LORD was all like, 'I got you fam,' and raised up these judges who totally saved them from those who were wrecking them. savedd means, like, saved, you know?) 17. But they totally ignored their judges, completely hooked on other gods and worshipped them. They ditched the righteous path their ancestors followed, disobeying the LORD's commandments, and it was not cool. 18. So, like, when God appointed judges, he totally had their back and saved them from their enemies the whole time they were in charge. It's because God felt really bad for them, you know? They were super bummed out and oppressed, and it really got to God. 19. So like, after the judge died, they went back to their old ways and like, totally went even further than their ancestors in worshiping other gods and like, doing all the bowing down stuff. They just couldn't stop themselves from doing their own rebellious things and following their stubborn ways. 20. God was really pissed at Israel, like super mad. He was all like, 'These people totally broke the promise I made with their ancestors, man, and they didn't even bother to listen to me, dude.' 21. I ain't gonna kick out anyone from the nations that Joshua didn't fully clear out before he passed away, ya know? 22. So I can test out these peeps and see if they'll stick to the Lord's path like their ancestors did, or not. Ya feel? 23. So God let those nations stay there, instead of making them leave right away or giving them to Joshua. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 21. And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you. {angel: or, messenger} 2. And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why have ye done this? 3. Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be {as thorns} in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you. 4. And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept. 5. And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD. {Bochim: that is, Weepers} 6. And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land. 7. And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel. {outlived: Heb. prolonged days after} 8. And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, {being} an hundred and ten years old. 9. And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill Gaash. {Timnathhares: also called, Timnathserah} 10. And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel. 11. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim: 12. And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that {were} round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger. 13. And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth. 14. And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies. 15. Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed. 16. Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them. {delivered: Heb. saved} 17. And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; {but} they did not so. 18. And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them. 19. And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, {that} they returned, and corrupted {themselves} more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way. {corrupted...: or, were corrupt} {ceased...: Heb. let nothing fall of their} 20. And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; 21. I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died: 22. That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep {it}, or not. 23. Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua. {left: or, suffered} \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 31. So, like, the nations that the LORD left behind were like a test for Israel, you know? It was for those peeps who didn't experience all the wars in Canaan and stuff. 2. Just so that the young peeps of Israel could gain some wisdom about the art of warfare in case they were clueless about it before, ya know? 3. So, like, there were these five Philistine leaders, and also all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who were living up in the mountains of Lebanon, starting from Mount Baalhermon all the way to the entrance of Hamath. 4. And they wanted to test Israel by using these situations to see if they would actually listen to the LORD's commandments, the same ones that were given to their ancestors through Moses. 5. So the Israel fam was living their best lives in the midst of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites fam: 6. And they, like, totally hooked up with each other's daughters and even got their own daughters married to their sons, all while worshipping those other gods. 7. So, the Israelites totally messed up and forgot about God. They started worshipping Baalim and hanging out in groves and stuff. 8. So, like, God got super mad at Israel and let them be taken over by this dude named Chushanrishathaim, who was, like, the king of Mesopotamia. And the people of Israel had to serve Chushanrishathaim for a whole eight years. (BTW, Mesopotamia is also known as Aramnaharaim in Hebrew, just FYI) 9. So, like, when the Israelites were like totally desperate and cried out to the LORD, guess what? The LORD hooked them up with a total hero, this dude called Othniel, who was like Caleb's bro and stuff. And Othniel was all about saving the people of Israel from their problems. So cool, right? 10. Then the LORD's vibe totally took over him, and he started being the boss, both judging Israel and getting into battles. And guess what? The LORD handed over Chushanrishathaim, the king of Mesopotamia, to him, and he totally crushed Chushanrishathaim. #Victory 11. And after forty years, the land finally chilled. Sadly, Othniel, Kenaz's kid, passed away. 12. So, like, the people of Israel messed up big time once again and God was totally not happy with them. He actually made this King Eglon from Moab super strong and powerful, all because the Israelites were constantly doing bad stuff that really annoyed God. 13. So, he rounded up the peeps from Ammon and Amalek, and straight up attacked Israel, taking over the city known for its rad palm trees. 14. So, like, the Israelites were, you know, totally under the rule of Eglon, the king of Moab, for, like, a whole 18 years. Can you even imagine? 🤯 15. So, like, when the kids of Israel were in a tough spot and really wanted some help, they called out to the LORD. And you know what? The LORD totally hooked them up! He sent this dude named Ehud, who was from the tribe of Benjamin and happened to be left-handed (kind of cool, right?). The Israelites decided to send a present to Eglon, the king of Moab, through Ehud as their way of saying thanks and showing respect. Oh, and just fyi, Benjamite means he's from Benjamin's fam, and 'lefthanded' means he was, like, naturally a lefty or something. 16. So, like, Ehud crafted this super cool dagger with two sharp edges, about a cubit long. And get this, he totally tucked it under his clothes, right on his right thigh! 17. So he gave the gift to Eglon, the king of Moab, who happened to be pretty chunky. 18. And once he was done giving the gift, he told the people carrying the gift to leave. 19. But then he like ditched the guys he was with near Gilgal and was like, yo king I got something super secret to tell you. And the king was like, shh bro, keep it on the DL. So everyone with them totally bounced out of there. 20. So Ehud went up to him and found him chilling in a private summer hangout spot. Ehud was like, 'Yo, I got a message from God for you.' And the dude stood up from his seat. 21. And Ehud flexed his left hand, swiped the dagger from his right thigh, and drove it straight into his belly: 22. And the handle went in too, after the blade; and the extra flesh closed over the blade, so that he couldn't pull the dagger out of his stomach; and the waste came out. 23. So Ehud dips out of here, goes through the doorway, slams the doors of the room behind him, and locks them tight. 24. When he left his room, his friends came in and noticed that the doors were locked. They were like, 'Oh, for sure he's just using the bathroom in his fancy summer spot.' 25. So they waited for a long time until they felt embarrassed, and guess what? The person in charge didn't even bother to open the doors for them. So they grabbed a key and unlocked them, only to find out that their boss had dropped dead on the floor. 26. And Ehud dipped outta there while they were chillin', and managed to peace out past the spot where they be working, and escaped to Seirath. 27. So, when he arrived, he busted out a sick trumpet solo on the Ephraim mountain, and all the Israelite homies followed him down from the summit, with him leading the crew like a boss. 28. And he's like, 'Yo, come with me, because the LORD totally handed your enemies, the Moabites, to you on a silver platter.' So they're like, 'Bet!' and they totally go with him and block off the Jordan river to Moab, not letting anyone pass through. 29. And they totally wrecked Moab, like, big time, taking down around ten thousand ridiculously strong and brave dudes. Like, seriously, not even one guy made it out alive. {lusty: Heb. fat} 30. So Moab got wrecked by Israel that day. And the land chilled for a solid eighty years. 31. Then there was Shamgar, Anath's son, who straight-up slayed 600 Philistines using just an ox goad. He totally saved Israel too, like a total boss. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 31. Now these {are} the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, {even} as many {of Israel} as had not known all the wars of Canaan; 2. Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 3. {Namely}, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 4. And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. 5. And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 6. And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 7. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves. 8. Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years. {Mesopotamia: Heb. Aramnaharaim} 9. And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, {even} Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother. {deliverer: Heb. saviour} 10. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim. {came: Heb. was} {Mesopotamia: Heb. Aram} 11. And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. 12. And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. 13. And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees. 14. So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. 15. But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab. {a Benjamite: or, the son of Jemini} {lefthanded: Heb. shut of his right hand} 16. But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. 17. And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon {was} a very fat man. 18. And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. 19. But he himself turned again from the quarries that {were} by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. {quarries: or, graven images} 20. And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of {his} seat. {a summer...: Heb. a parlour of cooling} 21. And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 22. And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out. {the dirt...: or, it came out at the buttocks} 23. Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them. 24. When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour {were} locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. {covereth...: or, doeth his easement} 25. And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened {them}: and, behold, their lord {was} fallen down dead on the earth. 26. And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. 27. And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them. 28. And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over. 29. And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man. {lusty: Heb. fat} 30. So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years. 31. And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 41. So, like, the Israelites went back to their bad ways once Ehud was gone, and that was a major bummer in God's eyes. 2. So, like, God was totally like, 'Yeah, you guys messed up big time!' and let this dude called Jabin, who was the king of Canaan, take control. He had this army leader named Sisera who lived in Harosheth, which was, like, a place with non-Israelite peeps. 3. So, the Israelites were like, 'Yo, God, we need your help ASAP! This dude had, like, 900 iron chariots and totally ruled over us for a whole 20 years! 4. Yo, check it out! Deborah, this mega talented chick, was not just any ordinary gal. She was a legit prophetess and happened to be married to Lapidoth. She straight up ruled the land of Israel during that time, making all the big decisions and keeping everyone on track. 5. So this chick Deborah was living in a super cool spot under a palm tree, like, right in between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim. And get this, the whole crew of Israel would roll up to her for some serious ruling and judgement vibes. 6. So she hit up Barak, Abinoam's son from Kedeshnaphtali, and was like, 'Yo, didn't the LORD God of Israel tell you to head over to mount Tabor? Take along ten thousand homies from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun.' 7. And I'll lure Sisera, the leader of Jabin's army, along with his chariots and his crew, right to the river Kishon. Then, I'll totally hand him over to you, no worries. 8. So Barak was like, 'Hey, if you come with me, I'm down to go. But if you're not down to go with me, then I ain't gonna go either.' 9. And she was like, 'Yeah, I'm totally down to go with you, but just so you know, this journey you're going on isn't gonna bring you any street cred, because the LORD is gonna hand Sisera over to a woman.' So Deborah got up and rolled out with Barak to Kedesh. 10. So Barak hit up Zebulun and Naphtali, and they all rolled to Kedesh. And he brought along a crew of ten thousand strong, with Deborah right there by his side. 11. So Heber, a Kenite who was related to Moses by marriage, decided to leave his people and set up his tent near the plain of Zaanaim, close to Kedesh. 12. So like, they totally informed Sisera that Barak, Abinoam's son, went up to Mount Tabor. 13. So Sisera gathered all of his wicked cool chariots, like, nine hundred iron chariots and all his homies from Harosheth of the Gentiles all the way to the river of Kishon. Like, they were ready to roll, ya know? 14. Deborah was like, yo Barak, get up! Today's the day the Lord has given you victory over Sisera. He's got your back, you know! So Barak went down from mount Tabor with ten thousand homies. 15. So, like, the LORD totally wrecked Sisera and all his chariots and crew with his sharp sword in front of Barak. Sisera had to bail out of his chariot and straight-up run away on foot, man. 16. But Barak totally went after the chariots and the whole crew until they reached Harosheth of the Gentiles. And guess what? Sisera's entire army got wrecked by the sword and not a single dude made it out alive. Like, nobody. 17. But, like, Sisera totally bolted on foot and went straight to Jael's crib. Jael was married to Heber the Kenite, ya know? 'Cause Jabin, the king of Hazor, and Heber's fam were chillin' and had a good thing going on. 18. So Jael went out to meet Sisera, and she was like, 'Yo, come chill with me, no worries.' And when he came into her tent, she hooked him up with a cozy blanket. 19. He asked her, 'Can you please give me a sip of water? I'm so thirsty.' So, she opened a bottle of milk and kindly gave him a drink, making sure he was comfortable. 20. He told her once again, just stand by the tent entrance. When any guy asks about you and wonders if there's a guy here, just tell them nah. 21. Then Jael, wife of Heber, grabbed a tent peg and a hammer. She approached him quietly, sneaking up while he was fast asleep and worn out. With a single strong strike, she drove the peg into his temples, securing it into the ground. And just like that, he breathed his last. 22. Yo, check it out! So Barak was chasing after Sisera, right? And then Jael comes out to meet him like, 'Hey, come here, I'll show you the guy you're looking for.' And when he goes into her crib, guess what? Boom! Sisera is lying dead there with a nail stuck in his head. 23. So, like, God totally defeated Jabin, the king of Canaan, that day in front of the Israelite squad. 24. The Israelites totally owned Jabin, the king of Canaan. They were super successful and totally dominated him until they completely wiped him out. #Winning \n",
      "KJV: Judges 41. And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead. 2. And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host {was} Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. 3. And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. 4. And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time. 5. And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment. 6. And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel commanded, {saying}, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun? 7. And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver him into thine hand. 8. And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, {then} I will not go. 9. And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh. 10. And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him. 11. Now Heber the Kenite, {which was} of the children of Hobab the father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which {is} by Kedesh. 12. And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor. 13. And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, {even} nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that {were} with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon. {together: Heb. by cry, or, proclamation} 14. And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this {is} the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him. 15. And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all {his} chariots, and all {his} host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off {his} chariot, and fled away on his feet. 16. But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; {and} there was not a man left. {a man: Heb. unto one} 17. Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for {there was} peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 18. And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle. {mantle: or, rug, or, blanket} 19. And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him. 20. Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No. 21. Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died. {and took: Heb. and put} 22. And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he came into her {tent}, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail {was} in his temples. 23. So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel. 24. And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. {prospered...: Heb. going went and was hard} \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 51. So, like, Deborah and Barak, Abinoam's son, totally dropped a sick rap on that day, you know? They were like, 'Listen up, everyone!' 2. OMG, let's give mad props to the LORD for totally avenging Israel, because the people were like, 'Yo, we're all in' and willingly gave themselves up for real! 3. Listen up, kings and princes! I, yes, me, am gonna sing for the LORD. I will sing praises to the LORD, the God of Israel. 4. Yo, God, when you dipped outta Seir and flexed outta the field of Edom, the whole earth straight shook like crazy, and the skies started pouring rain, fam. Even the clouds were dropping mad water, yo! 5. Dude, like, the mountains totally melted when the LORD showed up, bro. And even Mount Sinai, man, it melted too in front of the LORD God of Israel. It was like flowing, you know? 6. Back in the day when Shamgar, Anath's kid, and Jael were around, the roads were empty and people had to take the sneaky routes. Travelers had to walk those tricky paths, you know. 7. The people in the small towns totally stopped living their lives, they were just done in Israel, until your girl Deborah showed up, yes, you heard that right, I became a total boss mom of Israel. 8. They started simping for new gods, and you know what happened next? Straight up chaos, fam. Like, seriously, did anyone even spot a single shield or spear among the entire forty thousand of Israel? Nah, son, they were too busy with their new idol obsession. 9. I'm totally stoked about the awesome leaders of Israel who stepped up without hesitation. Praise the LORD, you guys! 10. Yo, listen up, you cool peeps riding on fancy rides, you all high and mighty making judgments, and strutting your stuff on the streets. 11. Those who escaped the sound of arrows while getting water, they'll talk about God doing righteous things in the towns of Israel. Then the people of God will gather at the gates to celebrate righteousness! 12. Yo, wake up, Deborah! Get up and drop a sick verse! Rise up, Barak, and conquer your enemies, son of Abinoam. 13. Then he gave the remaining guy the power to rule over the popular ones: the LORD made me have power over the strong. 14. From Ephraim rose up a leader against Amalek; Benjamin, you were next in line among your people. From Machir came those in authority, and from Zebulun came skillful writers and scribes. 15. So, like, the top peeps from Issachar were rollin' with Deborah, ya know? It was Issachar and also Barak, but Barak had to go on foot down into the valley. Meanwhile, the Reuben crew were dealin' with some major deep ponderings and contemplations in their hearts. #journeyonfoot #deepthoughts 16. Why are you hanging out with the sheep, listening to their noises? The people of Reuben are having some serious internal struggles. 17. Gilead was chilling on the other side of Jordan, but like, why was Dan still stuck on those ships? Asher just kept it cozy by the seashore, hangin' out in his favorite spots. 18. Zebulun and Naphtali, brave souls who fearlessly risked it all in the battlefields. They were unafraid of the risks and stood tall, even when others doubted. #Respect 19. Yo, the kings came and straight up battled it out, like the kings of Canaan went head to head in Taanach by Megiddo's water; but they ain't even make a single coin from it. 20. They went all out, flexing from the sky; even the stars showed up, taking on Sisera. {paths: Hebrew for 'strategic moves'} 21. Yo, the Kishon river straight up washed them away, that OG river, the Kishon river. O my soul, yo crushed that power. 22. Like, okay, the horsehoofs totally got messed up because of the intense pransings of their mighty ones. Like, they were trampling and plunging and stuff, it was wild. 23. Dang, Meroz, the angel of the LORD is not pleased. They're getting cursed big time because they didn't step up to help the LORD against the powerful forces. 24. Jael, Heber the Kenite's wife, is like, super blessed, okay? She's, like, the most blessed woman ever, especially among all the other ladies in the tent. It's a big deal, for real! 25. He was all like, 'Yo, can I get some water?' And she was like, 'Nah, bro, here's some milk.' And then she came through with that fancy butter in, like, a boss-level dish. 26. She grabbed a nail and a construction worker's hammer and she totally nailed it! With one swing, she took down Sisera by hitting his head and piercing through his temples. Talk about a powerful strike! 27. He was totally simping for her, like, he literally worshipped the ground she walked on. He was all like, on his knees, head over heels, just bowing down to her. And then, boom, at that very spot where he bowed, he straight up dropped dead. Like gone, obliterated. It was intense. 28. Sisera's mom peeped out the window and shouted through the blinds, like, why is his ride taking forever? What's up with the slow wheels on his chariot? 29. Her squad of smart homegirls chimed in, yeah, she had her own back and responded to herself. {answer: in other words, her words} 30. Did they not flex? Did they not split the loot, giving each guy a couple of chicks? Sisera got a rad, multicolored stash, a sick needlework collection on both sides, totally lit for flaunting those who snagged the booty. Like, seriously dope stuff! 31. So like, may all of your haters disappear, Lord; but those who ride or die for you should be as lit as the sun when it's flexing its power. And everything was chill in the land for forty years. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 51. Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying, 2. Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people willingly offered themselves. 3. Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, {even} I, will sing unto the LORD; I will sing {praise} to the LORD God of Israel. 4. LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water. 5. The mountains melted from before the LORD, {even} that Sinai from before the LORD God of Israel. {melted: Heb. flowed} 6. In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways. {travellers: Heb. walkers of paths} {byways: Heb. crooked ways} 7. {The inhabitants of} the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel, until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel. 8. They chose new gods; then {was} war in the gates: was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel? 9. My heart {is} toward the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD. 10. Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and walk by the way. {Speak: or, Meditate} 11. {They that are delivered} from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, {even} the righteous acts {toward the inhabitants} of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates. {righteous...: Heb. righteousnesses} 12. Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. 13. Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty. 14. Out of Ephraim {was there} a root of them against Amalek; after thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer. {handle: Heb. draw with} 15. And the princes of Issachar {were} with Deborah; even Issachar, and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of Reuben {there were} great thoughts of heart. {foot: Heb. his feet} {thoughts: Heb. impressions} {For: or, In} 16. Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben {there were} great searchings of heart. {For: or, In} 17. Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships? Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches. {shore: or, port} {breaches: or, creeks} 18. Zebulun and Naphtali {were} a people {that} jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field. {jeoparded: Heb. exposed to reproach} 19. The kings came {and} fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money. 20. They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. {courses: Heb. paths} 21. The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength. 22. Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones. {pransings: or, tramplings, or, plungings} 23. Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty. 24. Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent. 25. He asked water, {and} she gave {him} milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish. 26. She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples. {with...: Heb. she hammered} 27. At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead. {At: Heb. Between} {dead: Heb. destroyed} 28. The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot {so} long in coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots? 29. Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to herself, {answer: Heb. her words} 30. Have they not sped? have they {not} divided the prey; to every man a damsel {or} two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, {meet} for the necks of {them that take} the spoil? {every...: Heb. the head of a man} 31. So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but {let} them that love him {be} as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 61. So, the Israelites were totally messing up and not doing right in the eyes of the LORD. And you know what happened? Yep, the LORD let them have it and handed them over to Midian for a whopping seven years. 2. And the Midianites totally owned Israel: because of them, the Israelites had to start living in those cool mountain hideouts, caves, and strongholds. Felt like the Midianites were pretty strong, ya know? 3. So, like, when Israel finally finished planting their crops, the Midianites, the Amalekites, and those kids from the east, they all decided to team up and attack them out of nowhere; 4. So they set up camp against them and totally wrecked everything that grew from the earth, all the way to Gaza. They didn't leave any food for Israel, no sheep, no cows, no donkeys. (Or goats) 5. So, like, they all rolled in with their livestock and their fancy tents, and there were like a gazillion of them, you know, like a swarm of grasshoppers or something. I mean, seriously, there were so many of them that you couldn't even count their camels. And they straight up invaded the land to wreck it. 6. And Israel was super broke because of those Midianites; and the Israelite peeps cried out to the LORD. 7. So, like, one time, when the Israelites were, like, totally fed up with those Midianites, they hit up the LORD and were all, 'Help us out, dude!'  8. So, the LORD was like, 'Yo, I'm sending a prophet to the kids of Israel.' And this prophet comes through and says, 'Listen up, this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, has to say: I rescued you from Egypt and set you free from slavery.' 9. So like, I totally saved you from those Egyptians and all those people who were being mean to you. I kicked them out and gave you their land, you know? 10. Yo, I straight up told y'all, I'm the LORD your God. Don't stress over those Amorite gods in the place you're living, like seriously. But let's be real, you haven't exactly been listening to what I'm saying. 11. So this angel from the LORD showed up and just chilled under an oak tree in Ophrah. It belonged to a dude named Joash, who was from the Abiezrite fam. And meanwhile, Joash's son Gideon was out there doing some wheat threshing near the winepress, low-key trying to hide it from those Midianites. (FYI, Gideon's original name was legit Gedeon.) And he wanted to make it flee, you know what I'm sayin'? 12. And then this super awesome angel showed up, and was like, 'Yo dude, God is totally on your side, you're, like, this total legend of bravery.' 13. And Gideon was like, dude, seriously, if God is on our side, then why are all these bad things happening to us? And what happened to all those amazing miracles our ancestors used to tell us about, like when God brought us out of Egypt? It feels like God has abandoned us and let the Midianites take over. 14. Then God saw him and said, 'Yo, go flex your power and you'll be the one to rescue Israel from those Midianites. Like, haven't I sent you for this specific mission?' 15. And he was like, yo dude, how am I supposed to save Israel? My fam is mad broke in Manasseh, and I'm like the smallest fish in my dad's crib. Like, for real though, my fam is straight up the least important. 16. And God was like, 'Don't worry fam, I got you. You're gonna totally destroy the Midianites, like you'll be a one-man army and slay 'em all.' 17. And he was like, yo, if I'm chillin' with you, and you think I'm cool, then give me a sign that you're actually talking to me. 18. Yo, don't bounce just yet. Wait for me to come back with my gift and lay it down for you. And he was like, 'I'll chill until you return.' 19. So Gideon went and prepared a young goat and some unleavened cakes made with a whole bunch of flour. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, and then he brought it all out to him under the oak tree and presented it. 20. Then the angel of God was like, 'Yo dude, grab the food - the meat and those unleavened cakes. Put 'em on this rock and pour out the broth.' And he was like, 'Bet, I got you fam.' So he did it. 21. And then the angel of the LORD whipped out the end of his staff and tapped it on the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Suddenly, fire burst out from the rock and devoured the flesh and the unleavened cakes. After that, the angel of the LORD vanished from his view. 22. And when Gideon realized that it was an angel from the LORD, he was like, 'OMG, Lord GOD! I'm freaking out because I just saw an actual angel in person.' 23. And God was like, 'Yo, chill bro! Don't stress, you won't kick the bucket.' 24. So Gideon made this sick altar for the LORD, and named it Jehovahshalom: even now, it's still hanging in Ophrah with the Abiezrites. Jehovahshalom means, like, 'The LORD sends peace,' ya know? 25. So, like, that night, God was all like, 'Yo, dude, go get your dad's young bull, specifically this second bull that's, like, seven years old, and totally wreck the altar of Baal that your dad has set up, and, like, chop down that grove thing next to it. And, like, don't forget to do it, okay?' 26. Yo, make sure you construct a lit altar for the LORD your God on top of this rock, in a dope location fam. Then grab that second bullock and offer it up as a burnt sacrifice using the wood from the grove that you're gonna chop down. (By the way, 'rock' in Hebrew means 'strong place' and 'in the ordered place' could also mean 'in an orderly manner', ya dig?) 27. So Gideon gathered ten of his crew and followed the LORD's instructions just like he said. The reason he did it in secret at night was because he was afraid of his dad's fam and the homies in town. 28. So, like, when the dudes in the city woke up super early in the morning, they saw that the altar of Baal got wrecked, and the grove beside it got chopped down. And then they went ahead and sacrificed another bull on the fancy new altar they made. 29. And they were like, yo, who's responsible for this? So they started asking around and someone was like, bro, it was Gideon, Joash's son, who did this. 30. So, like, the guys in the city were all like, 'Yo, Joash, bring out your son so we can totally get rid of him!' 'Cause, like, he destroyed that altar of Baal and chopped down the grove next to it. 31. And Joash was like, y'all really gonna defend Baal? Seriously, tryna save him? Whoever still got his back, they gonna be toast first thing in the morning. If he's really a god, let him defend himself, 'cause someone went ahead and wrecked his altar. 32. So, like, on that day, he decided to call him Jerubbaal, because he totally tore down Baal's altar. You know, Jerubbaal means 'Let Baal handle this'. Oh, and Jerubbesheth means 'Let the shameful thing handle this', just FYI. 33. So like, all the Midianites, Amalekites, and like, the kids from the east, they all came together, and like, set up camp in the valley of Jezreel. 34. But then the LORD's Spirit totally vibes with Gideon, and he busts out a sick trumpet solo. And all the homies from Abiezer roll up to join him. {totally vibes with: like, connects with on a super deep level} {busts out: really shows off} {sick: awesome, amazing} {homies: friends, peeps} {roll up: show up} 35. And he texted the squad in Manasseh, and they all pulled up; then he texted the homies in Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they rolled through to link up with him. 36. And Gideon was like, 'Yo, God, if you're really gonna save Israel through me like you promised,' 37. Yo, I'm gonna lay down a fleece of wool on the floor. If the dew only falls on the fleece and not on the rest of the ground, then I'll know for real that You'll save Israel through me, just like You said. 38. And just like that, he got up mad early the next day and squeezed the fleece real tight, squeezing out all the dew into a bowl. The bowl was filled to the top with water, man. 39. Gideon was like, Godd, please don't be mad, give me this one chance to show you something. Let's do a little experiment with a piece of wool. If the wool is dry but the ground is covered in dew, then you'll see what I mean.' 40. So, like, God totally did this thing that night, ya know? The fleece was all dry and stuff, while the rest of the ground was covered in dew. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 61. And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years. 2. And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: {and} because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which {are} in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds. {prevailed: Heb. was strong} 3. And {so} it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them; 4. And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. {sheep: or goat} 5. For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; {for} both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it. 6. And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD. 7. And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites, 8. That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; {a prophet: Heb. a man a prophet} 9. And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land; 10. And I said unto you, I {am} the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice. 11. And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which {was} in Ophrah, that {pertained} unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide {it} from the Midianites. {Gideon: Gr. Gedeon} {to hide...: Heb. to cause it to flee} 12. And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD {is} with thee, thou mighty man of valour. 13. And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where {be} all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. 14. And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee? 15. And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family {is} poor in Manasseh, and I {am} the least in my father's house. {my family...: Heb. my thousand is the meanest} 16. And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. 17. And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me. 18. Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set {it} before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again. {present: or, meat offering} 19. And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought {it} out unto him under the oak, and presented {it}. {a kid: Heb. a kid of the goats} 20. And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay {them} upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. 21. Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that {was} in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight. 22. And when Gideon perceived that he {was} an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face. 23. And the LORD said unto him, Peace {be} unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die. 24. Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it {is} yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. {Jehovahshalom: that is, The LORD send peace} 25. And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that {is} by it: {even: or, and} 26. And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down. {rock: Heb. strong place} {in the ordered...: or, in an orderly manner} 27. Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and {so} it was, because he feared his father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not do {it} by day, that he did {it} by night. 28. And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that {was} by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar {that was} built. 29. And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. 30. Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that {was} by it. 31. And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst {it is yet} morning: if he {be} a god, let him plead for himself, because {one} hath cast down his altar. 32. Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar. {Jerubbaal: that is, Let Baal plead} {Jerubbesheth: that is, Let the shameful thing plead} 33. Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel. 34. But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him. {came...: Heb. clothed} {gathered: Heb. called} 35. And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. {gathered: Heb. called} 36. And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, 37. Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; {and} if the dew be on the fleece only, and {it be} dry upon all the earth {beside}, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said. 38. And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. 39. And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. 40. And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 71. So Jerubbaal, AKA Gideon, and all his homies woke up super early and set up camp near the dope well of Harod. The enemy Midianites were chillin' on the north side, by the lit hill of Moreh, in the valley. 2. God said to Gideon, 'Yo, dude, there are way too many people rollin' with you for me to let them defeat the Midianites. If I did, the Israelites would start flexin' and be like, 'I did this all by myself!' 3. So like, listen up, go tell all the peeps, if anyone is like scared or freaking out, they can dip out and peace out from Mount Gilead. And guess what? 22,000 of them actually bounced, leaving only 10,000 left. 4. So, the LORD told Gideon, 'Dude, there are way too many people here. Take them down to the water and I'll test them for you. Whoever I say can go with you, they can go. And whoever I say shouldn't go with you, they can't go.' 5. So like, he gathered all the people by the water, and the LORD was all like, 'Yo Gideon, check it out - anyone who laps the water with their tongue like a dog, separate them out. Also, anyone who gets down on their knees to drink, do the same.' 6. And there were like 300 dudes who were like drinking water by, like, putting their hand to their mouth, while everyone else totally kneeled down to drink water. 7. And God told Gideon, 'I'll save you and hand the Midianites over to you through the 300 dudes who drank water a certain way. Everyone else can just go back to their own turf.' 8. So the peeps grabbed their snacks and their trumpets: and he told the rest of Israel to head back to their tents, keeping only those three hundred guys: and the Midianites were chillin' in the valley below. 9. So, like, that night, God was all like, 'Yo, dude, get up and go down to the enemy camp, 'cause I already made them surrender to you.' 10. But hey, if you're too scared to go down, just take your homie Phurah with you to the squad: 11. And you gotta listen to what they're sayin'; then you'll get the confidence to join the crew. So, he went with his servant Phurah to the outskirts of the soldiers that were in the crew. 12. The Midianites, the Amalekites, and all the kids from the east were chilling in the valley, looking like a swarm of grasshoppers. They had camels for days, so many that it was like the sand at the beach. 13. So, when Gideon arrived, he saw this guy telling his friend about a dream. He was like, 'Yo, listen up, I had this wild dream. I saw a barley bread roll crash into the Midianite camp, knocking over one of their tents and flattening it.' 14. And his friend was like, 'Bro, this is straight up Gideon's sword, you know? He's a total badass from Israel and God totally dropped Midian and their whole crew into his hands.' 15. So, like, when Gideon heard about the dream and its meaning, he was all in awe and went back to the Israelite camp and was like, 'Yo, get up and get ready, 'cause the LORD has totally delivered the Midianites into our hands.' (Interpretation: Hebrew for 'breaking') 16. So he split the squad of three hundred guys into three groups, giving each one a trumpet and empty containers with lamps inside. 17. And he was like, yo, just peep me and do the same thing, like for real. And check it, when I head out of the camp, you gotta follow my lead and do exactly what I do, no cap. 18. Yo, when I start blasting on the trumpet, me and all my homies, y'all better start blowing them trumpets too, all over the camp. And make sure y'all shout, 'It's the sword of the LORD and Gideon!' 19. So Gideon and his squad of a hundred dudes rolled up to the outskirts of the camp at, like, midnight. The watch had just started, so they didn't waste any time. They whipped out their trumpets and shattered the pitchers they were holding. 20. Then the three groups took out their trumpets, broke the pitchers, and held the flashlights in their left hands, while they blew their trumpets with their right hands. They shouted, 'It's time for the Lord and Gideon to bring out their swords!' 21. And they were all in their own spots around the camp: and everyone started running, screaming, and freaking out. 22. Then the three hundred people blew the trumpets, and God made each person fight against each other throughout the entire army. The army ran away to Bethshittah in Zererath and to the border of Abelmeholah, all the way to Tabbath. 23. The dudes from Israel rounded up from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and chased after those Midianites. 24. So Gideon sent messages to everyone in mount Ephraim, like 'Yo, let's crush the Midianites! Meet us at Bethbarah and Jordan to grab the water.' Then all the dudes from Ephraim came through, and they snagged the water at Bethbarah and Jordan. 25. So they captured two Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. Oreb was killed on the rock named after him, and Zeeb was slain at the winepress called Zeeb. Then they chased after the rest of the Midianites, and presented Gideon with the heads of Oreb and Zeeb on the other side of the Jordan river. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 71. Then Jerubbaal, who {is} Gideon, and all the people that {were} with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley. 2. And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that {are} with thee {are} too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me. 3. Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever {is} fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand. 4. And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people {are} yet {too} many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, {that} of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go. 5. So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink. 6. And the number of them that lapped, {putting} their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. 7. And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the {other} people go every man unto his place. 8. So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all {the rest of} Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley. 9. And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand. 10. But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host: 11. And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that {were} in the host. {armed men: or, ranks by five} 12. And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels {were} without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude. 13. And when Gideon was come, behold, {there was} a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along. 14. And his fellow answered and said, This {is} nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: {for} into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host. 15. And it was {so}, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian. {interpretation: Heb. breaking} 16. And he divided the three hundred men {into} three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers. {a trumpet...: Heb. trumpets in the hand of all of them} {lamps: or, firebrands, or, torches} 17. And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be {that}, as I do, so shall ye do. 18. When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that {are} with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, {The sword} of the LORD, and of Gideon. 19. So Gideon, and the hundred men that {were} with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that {were} in their hands. 20. And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow {withal}: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. 21. And they stood every man in his place round about the camp: and all the host ran, and cried, and fled. 22. And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, {and} to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath. {in: or, toward} {border: Heb. lip} 23. And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites. 24. And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. 25. And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 81. And the guys from Ephraim were like, bro, why didn't you hit us up before you went to battle the Midianites? They were seriously pissed off at him. 2. And he was like, yo, what I did? Can't even compare to what you guys did, ya know? The leftovers from Ephraim's grapes are way better than Abiezer's harvest, trust me. 3. Yo, God totally handed over those Midianite princes, Oreb and Zeeb, to you. And seriously, what could I even do in comparison to you? They totally calmed down and chilled out once you said that. 4. So, Gideon and his crew of 300 homies made it across the Jordan River. They were tired as heck, but still going strong, chasing after those dudes. 5. Yo, guys from Succoth, can you hook us up with some bread for the squad? They're mad hungry and I'm chasing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the Midian kings. 6. So, like, the leaders of Succoth were all, 'Hey, do you even have those Zebah and Zalmunna dudes, like, caught and stuff? 'Cuz if you don't, we're not about to give bread to your whole army, ya know?' 7. And Gideon was like, once the LORD helps me defeat Zebah and Zalmunna, I'm gonna totally wreck you by scratching you up with thorny plants from the wild. 8. And then he went to Penuel, and he spoke to them too. And the guys at Penuel answered him just like the guys at Succoth did. 9. Then he talked to the dudes from Penuel and was like, 'Yo, when I come back all chill, I'm totally gonna wreck this tower.' 10. So Zebah and Zalmunna were chilling in Karkor, with their whole squad of about 15k dudes. They were the only ones left from the massive army of the eastern peeps, because they straight up wiped out 120k sword-wielding warriors. 11. So Gideon rolled up to the chill spot where the tent-dwelling crew of Nobah and Jogbehah were posted up, and totally wrecked their squad, 'cause they were sleeping on their defenses. 12. And when Zebah and Zalmunna dipped, he went after them, nabbed the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and totally spooked their entire crew. {discomfited: Hebrew for terrified} 13. So Gideon, Joash's son, came back from the battle before sunrise, 14. So they grabbed this dude from a town called Succoth, and they asked him to spill the tea. And he spilled all the deets about the big shots and old heads of Succoth – a total of 67 dudes. 15. So he went up to the guys in Succoth and was like, 'Yo, check it out, Zebah and Zalmunna, the dudes you were all hating on me about, asking if I actually got my hands on them. Now, can you hook up my tired homies with some bread or what?'} 16. So he grabbed the OGs from the hood, along with some wild prickly plants, and used them to school the homies in Succoth. {taught: To make them understand} 17. And he totally destroyed the tower of Penuel, and wiped out all the dudes in the city. 18. So he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, what kind of dudes did you kill at Tabor? And they said, just like you, man, they looked like some royal kids, all stylish and stuff. 19. And he was like, yo, they were my bros, my actual blood, you know? Swear to God, if you had kept them alive, I wouldn't have to take you down. 20. And he was like, 'Jether, dude, go and like, totally take them out.' But Jether, being all young and stuff, didn't draw his sword 'cause he was kinda scared, you know, being such a young one and all. 21. So Zebah and Zalmunna were like, 'Come at us, bro!' because they thought Gideon's strength was equal to his appearance. But Gideon didn't back down - he straight up defeated Zebah and Zalmunna, and even swiped the bling off their camels' necks! 22. So the guys from Israel were like, 'Gideon, dude, you should totally be in charge of us, and your son, and even your son's son. 'Cause you totally saved us from those Midian people, man. 23. And Gideon was like, 'Nah fam, I ain't gonna be your ruler, and my future offspring won't either. God's the one in charge, yo.' 24. So, Gideon was like, yo my peeps, I got a small favor to ask. Can y'all hook me up with the earrings you snagged from the enemy? (Cause those Ishmaelites were all about that bling bling.) 25. And they were like, 'Sure, we'll gladly give {them}.' So they grabbed a hoodie and everyone threw in their cool earrings. 26. And the gold earrings he asked for weighed a thousand and seven hundred shekels. And that's not even counting the cool accessories, fancy necklaces, and dope purple clothes that the Midianite kings wore. Oh, and let's not forget about the sick chains around their camels' necks. Those guys knew how to rock some serious bling.  27. So Gideon made this cool ephod thing and put it in his city, Ophrah. All of Israel got super obsessed with it and got totally distracted. But this actually ended up causing big problems for Gideon and his fam. 28. So, like, Midian totally got owned by the Israelites, and after that, they didn't mess with them again. The whole place was chill for, like, forty years when Gideon was in charge. 29. So Jerubbaal, Joash's son, moved into his own crib. 30. Gideon had a total of seventy sons, all born from different moms, because he had multiple wives. (Note: The phrase 'going out of his thigh' refers to biological offspring.) 31. So this guy had a side chick in Shechem who had his son and he named him Abimelech. 32. And Gideon, Joash's son, passed away at a ripe old age and was laid to rest in the tomb of his father Joash, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 33. After Gideon died, the Israelites straight up went back to their old ways and started worshipping Baalim, like they were thirsting for attention. They even made Baalberith their ultimate idol. 34. But the Israel fam totally forgot about the LORD their God, who saved them from all their haters on all sides. Like, come on guys, remember your blessings! 35. They didn't even appreciate what Gideon, also known as Jerubbaal, did for Israel. Despite all the incredible things he did, they didn't show him any love or recognition. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 81. And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply. {Why...: Heb. What thing is this thou hast done unto us} {sharply: Heb. strongly} 2. And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? {Is} not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? 3. God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that. {anger: Heb. spirit} 4. And Gideon came to Jordan, {and} passed over, he, and the three hundred men that {were} with him, faint, yet pursuing {them}. 5. And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they {be} faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian. 6. And the princes of Succoth said, {Are} the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army? 7. And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers. {tear: Heb. thresh} 8. And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered {him}. 9. And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower. 10. Now Zebah and Zalmunna {were} in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand {men}, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. {men that...: or, every one drawing a sword} 11. And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure. 12. And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host. {discomfited: Heb. terrified} 13. And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun {was up}, 14. And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, {even} threescore and seventeen men. {described: Heb. writ} 15. And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, {Are} the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men {that are} weary? 16. And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. {taught: Heb. made to know} 17. And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city. 18. Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men {were they} whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou {art}, so {were} they; each one resembled the children of a king. {resembled...: Heb. according to the form, etc} 19. And he said, They {were} my brethren, {even} the sons of my mother: {as} the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you. 20. And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, {and} slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he {was} yet a youth. 21. Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man {is, so is} his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that {were} on their camels' necks. {ornaments: or, ornaments like the moon} 22. Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian. 23. And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you. 24. And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they {were} Ishmaelites.) 25. And they answered, We will willingly give {them}. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey. 26. And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred {shekels} of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that {was} on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that {were} about their camels' necks. {collars: or, sweet jewels} 27. And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, {even} in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. 28. Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon. 29. And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. 30. And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives. {of his...: Heb. going out of his thigh} 31. And his concubine that {was} in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech. {called: Heb. set} 32. And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. 33. And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god. 34. And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side: 35. Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, {namely}, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 91. So Abimelech, who was the son of Jerubbaal, traveled to Shechem to connect with his extended fam and have a chat with them and his mom's side of the family, and he was like, 2. Yo, listen up everyone in Shechem. I got a question for ya: Would you rather have all the 70 sons of Jerubbaal ruling over you or just one? Don't forget, we're family too. Think about it, fam. 3. His mom's fam started talking about him to everyone in Shechem, saying all this stuff: and it totally won everyone over to Abimelech's side. They were like, 'Yo, he's family. We gotta ride with him.' 4. So they gave him 70 silver coins from the house of Baalberith, which Abimelech used to hire a bunch of useless and irresponsible people to follow him. 5. Then he went to his dad's place in Ophrah and killed all seventy of his bros, Jerubbaal's sons, on a single stone. But the youngest son, Jotham, managed to hide and survive. 6. So, all the dudes from Shechem and the Millo fam got together and went to make Abimelech the king, at this spot near the pillar in Shechem, where there was an ancient oak tree. 7. So, like, when they told Jotham what went down, he straight up went and stood on top of mount Gerizim, raised his voice and shouted, saying, 'Listen up, folks of Shechem! If you want God to listen to you, then you better listen to me too!' 8. So, like, the trees were like, 'Hey, let's find a boss to rule over us!' And they asked the olive tree to be their king. 9. But the olive tree was like, 'Wait, you want me to ditch all this richness that brings honor to God and humans, just to become some kind of tree celebrity? Like, really?' 10. And the trees were like, 'Hey fig tree, you should totally be our ruler!' 11. Yo, the fig tree was like, 'Why should I ditch my sweetness and good fruit just to be the top dog among the trees?' 12. The trees were like, 'Hey vine, come join us and be our ruler.' 13. And the vine was like, why would I ditch my awesome wine that brings joy to both God and humans, just to be some big shot among the trees? 14. Then all the trees said to the bramble, Yo, come and be our ruler. 15. And the bramble was like, 'Yo, trees! If y'all really want me to be your king, then come chill under my shade and trust me. But if not, watch out 'cause this bramble's gonna spit some fire and burn those fancy cedars of Lebanon.' 16. So, like, if y'all have really been genuine and fair by making Abimelech king, and if you've treated Jerubbaal and his fam with respect, doing right by him and everything he deserves, then... 17. Yo, my pops really came through for you, went all out and risked his life for you to save you from those Midianites and stuff. Like, he legit put everything on the line for you, no cap. He straight up cast his life out there, ya feel me? 18. So, like, y'all totally rebelled against my dad's house today and straight up killed all his sons, like 70 of 'em, all in one go! And then you went ahead and crowned Abimelech, the son of his servant, as king over the dudes in Shechem, just 'cause he's technically your brother, or whatever. Like, seriously? 🙄 19. If y'all have been real and legit with Jerubbaal and his crew today, then celebrate Abimelech and let him be stoked about y'all too: 20. But if they don't, like, ya know, Abimelech be spitin' fire and totally wreckin' the dudes in Shechem and the crib in Millo; and let the homies in Shechem and Millo spit fire too, and, like, totally destroy Abimelech. 21. So Jotham dipped outta there, bounced, and jetted straight to Beer, set up camp, all because he was shook of Abimelech, his own bro. 22. When Abimelech was ruling the land of Israel for three whole years, 23. So, like, God sent this really bad vibe between Abimelech and the dudes from Shechem, and the Shechem peeps totally stabbed Abimelech in the back, man: 24. So that the punishment for the awful act committed against the seventy sons of Jerubbaal could come, and the blame be placed on Abimelech, their brother, who killed them, as well as on the people of Shechem who supported him in his evil deeds. 25. So these guys from Shechem set up a sneaky trap on top of the mountains and started stealing from anyone who passed by. Someone snitched to Abimelech about it. 26. Then Gaal, the son of Ebed, showed up with his crew and rolled into Shechem. The people of Shechem were vibin' with him, full of trust and all that. 27. So they went out to the fields, gathered their vineyards, stomped the grapes, had a great time, went to their favorite hangout, had some food and drinks, and ended up badmouthing Abimelech. 28. And Gaal, son of Ebed, was like, 'Who is this Abimelech guy? And who cares about Shechem? Why should we even serve him? Isn't he just Jerubbaal's son? And isn't Zebul just his lackey? We should totally serve the dudes from Shechem's father, Hamor. Like, what's the point of serving this Abimelech dude anyway? Why bother?'} 29. And I wish I could totally take charge of this situation! Then I would totally get rid of Abimelech. And he told Abimelech to assemble a bigger army and face the challenge head on. 30. And when Zebul, the boss of the city, heard what Gaal, the son of Ebed, said, he got hella mad. {hot: or, fired up} 31. So, he secretly messaged Abimelech and was like, 'Yo, Abimelech, check it out. Gaal and his crew just rolled into Shechem, and they're like totally beefing up the city to go against you.' 32. So like, get up at night, you and your squad, and like, hide in the field, ready for the hustle: 33. So, here's the deal: as soon as the sun peeks out in the morning, you gotta wake up bright and early and make your move on the city. And guess what? When they come out to confront you with their crew, you can handle them however you see fit. It's all up to you and what seems right in the moment, no limitations. 34. So Abimelech and all his squad, like, snuck around at night and set up ambushes in Shechem with four different groups. 35. So Gaal, Ebed's son, went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelech and his crew, who were hiding, got up. 36. So, like, Gaal sees these people and he's all like, 'Yo Zebul, check it out, people are coming down from the mountains!' And Zebul's like, 'Bro, chill. That's just the shadows of the mountains, looking like people and messing with your head.' 37. So Gaal started talking again, like bro, check it out, there are these people coming down through the middle of the land, and there's another group coming along through the plain of Meonenim. (FYI, Meonenim means like, the time-watchers or something) 38. Zebul was like, 'Dude, what happened to all that big talk of yours? You were all, 'Who even is this Abimelech guy that we should serve him?' Now look at you, dissing the same people you used to downplay. Time to back it up and prove yourself, bro. So go out there, I dare you, and show 'em what you're made of by fighting them. 39. So Gaal, like, led the dudes from Shechem and totally fought against Abimelech. 40. Abimelech totally went after him, and he hightailed it outta there, with tons of casualties and injuries, all the way to the entrance of the gate. 41. So Abimelech stayed in Arumah and Zebul kicked Gaal and his crew out of Shechem, not letting them stay there. 42. The next day, everyone headed out to the field and spilled the tea to Abimelech. 43. So he gathered the peeps and split 'em into three squads, then set up an ambush in the field. He spotted the crowd comin' outta the city and went for 'em, straight up wrecking 'em. 44. Abimelech and his squad bolted forward and took positions at the entrance of the city gate. Meanwhile, the other two crews sprinted towards everyone chilling in the fields and straight up ended them. 45. So, Abimelech totally went all out and attacked the city, going at it the whole day. And you know what? He ended up capturing the city, wiping out everyone in it and even destroying the whole place. To top it off, he even spread salt all over the land, making sure nothing would grow there again. 46. And when all the guys at the tower of Shechem heard about it, they went into a safe spot in the crib of the god Berith. 47. Abimelech heard that everyone at the Shechem tower had gathered up. 48. So Abimelech went up to mount Zalmon with his crew, and he grabbed an axe and cut down a branch from a tree. He put it on his shoulder and said to the people with him, 'Do what you just saw me do, and do it quickly.' 49. And everyone there grabbed a branch and joined Abimelech's crew. They took over the tower, set it on fire, and wiped out everyone inside. There were about a thousand men and women who lost their lives in the tower of Shechem too. 50. So Abimelech went to Thebez, set up camp there, and successfully captured it. 51. So there was this epic tower in the city, and all the dudes and ladies, and everyone in the city, hurried over there and locked the entrance. They made their way up to the roof of the tower like champs. 52. So Abimelech, like, totally approached the tower and started a fierce fight, pushing hard against the door with the savage intention of setting it ablaze. 53. So basically, this woman went all out and chucked a millstone at Abimelech's head, smashing his skull to pieces. 54. So he quickly called over his homie, his armor-wearing partner, and said to him, 'Yo, grab your sword and take me out, so people don't go around saying I got taken out by a chick.' And his homie straight up stabbed him, and he died. 55. So, like, when the guys from Israel saw that Abimelech was totally dead, they all bounced and went back home. 56. So God made Abimelech face the consequences for the evil he did by killing his seventy brothers, just like he deserved: 57. God totally made the Shechem dudes pay for all the messed up stuff they did, and they had to deal with Jotham's curse too! \n",
      "KJV: Judges 91. And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother's father, saying, 2. Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether {is} better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, {which are} threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I {am} your bone and your flesh. {Whether...: Heb. What is good? whether, etc} 3. And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He {is} our brother. {to follow: Heb. after} 4. And they gave him threescore and ten {pieces} of silver out of the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him. 5. And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, {being} threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself. 6. And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that {was} in Shechem. {plain: or, oak} 7. And when they told {it} to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you. 8. The trees went forth {on a time} to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us. 9. But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? {go...: or, go up and down for other trees} 10. And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, {and} reign over us. 11. But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees? 12. Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, {and} reign over us. 13. And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees? 14. Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, {and} reign over us. {bramble: or, thistle} 15. And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, {then} come {and} put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. 16. Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands; 17. (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian: {adventured...: Heb. cast his life} 18. And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he {is} your brother;) 19. If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, {then} rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you: 20. But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech. 21. And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother. 22. When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel, 23. Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: 24. That the cruelty {done} to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brethren. {aided...: Heb. strengthened his hands to kill} 25. And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech. 26. And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. 27. And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode {the grapes}, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech. {merry: or, songs} 28. And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who {is} Abimelech, and who {is} Shechem, that we should serve him? {is} not {he} the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him? 29. And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out. 30. And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. {kindled: or, hot} 31. And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee. {privily: Heb. craftily or, to Tormah} 32. Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that {is} with thee, and lie in wait in the field: 33. And it shall be, {that} in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, {when} he and the people that {is} with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion. {as thou shalt...: Heb. as thine hand shall find} 34. And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that {were} with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies. 35. And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that {were} with him, from lying in wait. 36. And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as {if they were} men. 37. And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim. {middle: Heb. navel} {Meonenim: or, the regarders of times} 38. Then said Zebul unto him, Where {is} now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who {is} Abimelech, that we should serve him? {is} not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them. 39. And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. 40. And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown {and} wounded, {even} unto the entering of the gate. 41. And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem. 42. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech. 43. And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people {were} come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them. 44. And Abimelech, and the company that {was} with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two {other} companies ran upon all {the people} that {were} in the fields, and slew them. 45. And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that {was} therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt. 46. And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard {that}, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith. 47. And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. 48. And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that {were} with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid {it} on his shoulder, and said unto the people that {were} with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, {and} do as I {have done}. {me do: Heb. I have done} 49. And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put {them} to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women. 50. Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it. 51. But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut {it} to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower. 52. And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. 53. And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull. 54. Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died. 55. And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place. 56. Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 57. And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 101. And right after Abimelech, there was this dude named Tola, son of Puah, son of Dodo, repping the tribe of Issachar. He set up shop in Shamir, up in the mountains of Ephraim, holding it down for Israel and keeping them safe. 2. And he was in charge of the Israelites for 23 years, and then he passed away and was laid to rest in Shamir. 3. Then there was this guy named Jair, from Gilead, and he was like the boss of Israel for twenty-two years. 4. He had like, thirty sons who rode on thirty dope-looking colts, and they were balling with thirty cities, known as Havothjair till now, in the Gilead region. #VillageGoals 💯 5. And Jair passed away and got buried in Camon. 6. So, the Israelites messed up again and totally disobeyed the LORD. They started worshipping all these other gods like Baalim, Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Zidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the children of Ammon, and even the gods of the Philistines! They straight-up abandoned the LORD and stopped serving Him. Smh. 7. God was really furious with Israel, so he let the Philistines and Ammonites take control over them. 8. And for a solid eighteen years, they straight up messed with and made life miserable for the children of Israel who were chilling on the other side of the Jordan River in Amorite territory, specifically in Gilead. It was like they totally crushed them and brought them down. 9. And then the Ammonites crossed the Jordan River to go and battle against the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. It was a real mess for Israel, they were seriously struggling. 10. So, the Israelite fam was like, 'OMG, Lord! We messed up big time. We totally ditched You and started serving these other gods called Baalim.' 11. So, like, God was talking to the Israelites, and He was all like, 'Dudes, didn't I totally rescue you from the Egyptians, Amorites, Ammonites, and Philistines?' 12. The Zidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites were totally oppressing you, but you reached out to me and I totally came to your rescue, freeing you from their grip. 13. But you've totally ditched me and started simping for other gods, so I'm not gonna come through for you anymore. 14. Hit up your fave gods and straight up ask for their help when things get tough. Let's see if they can pull you out of this mess! 15. Yo, LORD, we messed up big time. We're totally accepting whatever punishment you think is right for us. Just please, we're begging you, save us from this mess today. #WhateverYouThinkIsBest 16. And they ditched all those weird gods they were into, and started serving the LORD. And man, it really broke His heart to see how messed up things were for His people, like, it really hit Him hard. 17. So, like, the Ammon squad got together and set up camp in Gilead. And the Israel crew, they all gathered up and set up camp in Mizpeh. (BTW, gatheredd' here means they cried out or something) 18. So like, the folks and leaders of Gilead were all like, 'Yo, who's gonna step up and take on the Ammonites? Whoever does will totally be the boss of everyone in Gilead!' \n",
      "KJV: Judges 101. And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim. {defend: or, deliver: Heb. save} 2. And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir. 3. And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty and two years. 4. And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which {are} in the land of Gilead. {Havothjair: or, the villages of Jair} 5. And Jair died, and was buried in Camon. 6. And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him. 7. And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon. 8. And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel: eighteen years, all the children of Israel that {were} on the other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which {is} in Gilead. {oppressed: Heb. crushed} 9. Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed. 10. And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim. 11. And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, {Did} not {I deliver you} from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? 12. The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand. 13. Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more. 14. Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. 15. And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day. {seemeth...: Heb. is good in thine eyes} 16. And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel. {strange...: Heb. gods of strangers} {grieved: Heb. shortened} 17. Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh. {gathered: Heb. cried} 18. And the people {and} princes of Gilead said one to another, What man {is he} that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 111. So, like, Jephthah was this super strong dude from Gilead, and his mom was, you know, a harlot. Gilead was his dad, and he's the one who brought Jephthah into the world. 2. So the wife of Gilead had sons, and her sons grew up and kicked Jephthah out, saying, 'You won't get any of our inheritance, dude, because your mom isn't one of us.' 3. So Jephthah bounced from his crew and crashed in the land of Tob. There, he linked up with a bunch of sketchy dudes who rolled with him. 4. So like, after a while, the Ammonites started a war with Israel. 5. So basically, the Ammonites thought they could mess with Israel, but guess what? The wise folks of Gilead decided to call upon Jephthah from Tob to handle the situation. 6. They were like, 'Hey Jephthah, you should totally be our leader so we can take on those Ammonites and show them who's boss.' 7. Yo, I gotta ask the Gilead crew: wasn't it you who straight up hated on me and kicked me out of my own crib? So why y'all suddenly showing up at my doorstep when you're in some deep trouble? 8. So, like, the older dudes from Gilead were all like, 'Yo Jephthah, we need your help, bro! Come kick some butt with us against those Ammonite peeps, and be our leader over everyone in Gilead!' 9. So Jephthah was like, 'Yo, Gilead elders! If you bring me back to whoop the Ammonite kids, and if the big man upstairs helps me win, will y'all make me your leader? 10. The older folks from Gilead were like, 'Yo Jephthah, the big guy upstairs gonna be watching over us to see if we do what you say. If not, He gonna hold us accountable, no cap.' 11. So Jephthah was like, 'Let's roll, Gilead fam!' And the people were like, 'You're in charge, bro!' And Jephthah made sure to speak his mind to the big man upstairs, in Mizpeh. 12. So, Jephthah hit up the king of the Ammonites with a DM and was like, 'Yo dude, what's your deal? Why you tryna start a fight in my turf?' 13. So, like, the king of the Ammonites, he was all like, 'Yo, Jephthah's messengers, let me tell you why I'm ticked off. Israel totally swiped my turf when they bailed outta Egypt. They basically jacked up everything from Arnon to Jabbok and all the way to the Jordan River. So, here's the deal: give it back, bro, and let's keep the peace.' 14. So Jephthah hit up the king of the Ammonites again with his squad of messengers: 15. Jephthah was like, 'Yo, listen up. Israel didn't snatch the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites. No bad vibes here, fam. 16. But yo, when Israel bounced outta Egypt, and like, hiked through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and finally reached Kadesh; 17. So Israel hit up the king of Edom with a DM, like, 'Hey, can I slide through your land real quick?' But the king of Edom was like, 'Nah, not feeling it.' They tried the same thing with the king of Moab, but he wasn't down either. So, Israel had to chill in Kadesh for a bit. 18. So they like, wandered through the wilderness and stuff, and went around the land of Edom and Moab. They came near the east side of Moab and set up camp on the other side of Arnon, but they didn't actually enter Moab territory because Arnon was like the border and all. 19. So Israel hit up Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who was ruling in Heshbon. And Israel was like, 'Yo, bro, can we slide through your turf and get to our destination?' 20. But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his territory. Instead, Sihon gathered all his crew and set up camp in Jahaz, ready to throw down with Israel. 21. And then the LORD God of Israel totally handed over Sihon and all his peeps to Israel, and they totally crushed them: so Israel totally took over all the land of the Amorites, the cool dudes who were living there, ya know. 22. And they totally took over all the territories of the Amorites, from Arnon all the way to Jabbok, and from the deserted areas right up to the Jordan River. 23. So, like, the LORD God of Israel just totally kicked the Amorites out of the way for His people Israel, and now you're gonna take possession of it or what? 24. Like, aren't you gonna claim the stuff that Chemosh, your god, gives you to claim? If the LORD our God kicks anyone out in front of us, we'll totally claim 'em. 25. And hey, are you seriously thinking you're cooler than Balak, Zippor's son and the Moabite king? Like, did he ever even try to go against Israel or fight them? 26. So like, Israel was living in Heshbon and its towns, and also in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities along the coast of Arnon for a long three hundred years. But hey, why didn't you guys get your act together and take back those towns during all that time? 27. Dude, listen up. I haven't done anything wrong to you, but it's totally not cool that you're coming at me with this war. May the LORD, the ultimate Judge, make the final call today between the peeps of Israel and Ammon. 28. But, like, the king of the Ammonites didn't even listen to what Jephthah said when he sent him, y'know. 29. And then, the Spirit of the LORD was like totally on Jephthah, and he like cruised through Gilead and Manasseh, making his way to Mizpeh of Gilead. And from Mizpeh of Gilead, he went all the way to the children of Ammon. 30. So, Jephthah made a promise to the LORD and said, like, If You really come through and help me defeat the Ammonites, 31. So, like, here's the deal: If anything comes out of my house to greet me when I come back safely from dealing with the children of Ammon, then it's gonna belong to the LORD and I'll totally offer it up as a burnt offering. No joke. 32. So Jephthah went to battle against the people of Ammon; and God helped him win the fight. 33. And he totally wrecked them from Aroer all the way to Minnith, like, obliterating twenty cities and the vineyard area, with, like, a crazy intense massacre. So, basically, the Ammonites got completely owned by the Israelites. It was epic. #NoMercy 34. So Jephthah went back home to Mizpeh, and guess what? His daughter came out to greet him with timbrels and dancing. And get this, she was his only child - he didn't have any other sons or daughters. Like, it was just the two of them, you know? 35. And when he saw her, he like totally ripped his clothes and was like, OMG, my daughter! You've like totally brought me down and you're one of those people who stress me out: 'cause I made this big promise to the LORD, and like there's no going back on that now. 36. And she was like, 'Dad, if you actually made a promise to the LORD, then you gotta stick to it. Do whatever you said you would, because the LORD has already gotten revenge on your enemies, the Ammonites.' 37. And she was like, yo dad, let me do this thing: give me some solo time for two months, so I can wander around the mountains and be all sad about not losing my virginity, me and my crew. {wander around...: Or, go and wander on the mountains} 38. And he was like, 'Just go, I guess.' So he told her to leave and she bounced for two whole months. She went up to the mountains with her besties and was all like, 'OMG, I can't believe I'm still a virgin! This sucks!'} 39. After two months, she went back to her father who fulfilled the promise he made to God. She remained pure and didn't have any relationships. This was a tradition observed in Israel. 40. Every year, the girls of Israel would gather to honor and remember the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite for four days. They would come together to talk and share their sorrow. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 111. Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he {was} the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah. {Jephthah: Gr. Jephthae} {an harlot: Heb. a woman an harlot} 2. And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up, and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father's house; for thou {art} the son of a strange woman. 3. Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with him. {from: Heb. from the face of} 4. And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel. {in process...: Heb. after days} 5. And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob: 6. And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we may fight with the children of Ammon. 7. And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress? 8. And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. 9. And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head? 10. And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words. {witness...: Heb. the hearer between us} 11. Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his words before the LORD in Mizpeh. 12. And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me to fight in my land? 13. And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those {lands} again peaceably. 14. And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon: 15. And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon: 16. But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh; 17. Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken {thereto}. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not {consent}: and Israel abode in Kadesh. 18. Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon {was} the border of Moab. 19. And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place. 20. But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 21. And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. 22. And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan. 23. So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it? 24. Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess. 25. And now {art} thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them, 26. While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that {be} along by the coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover {them} within that time? 27. Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon. 28. Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him. 29. Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over {unto} the children of Ammon. 30. And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, 31. Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD'S, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. {whatsoever...: Heb. that which cometh forth, which shall come forth} {and...: or, or I will offer it, etc} 32. So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands. 33. And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, {even} twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel. {the plain: or, Abel} 34. And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she {was his} only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter. {beside...: or, he had not of his own either son or daughter: Heb. of himself} 35. And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back. 36. And she said unto him, My father, {if} thou hast opened thy mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies, {even} of the children of Ammon. 37. And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows. {go up...: Heb. go and go down} 38. And he said, Go. And he sent her away {for} two months: and she went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. 39. And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her {according} to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel, {custom: or, ordinance} 40. {That} the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year. {yearly: Heb. from year to year} {to lament: or, to talk with} \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 121. So, like, the guys from Ephraim, they all got together and headed up north. They went up to Jephthah and were like, 'Dude, why did you go and fight against the Ammonites without asking us to come along? If you pulled that move, we'll totally wreck your house with fire.' (And just so you know, gatheredd themselves together' is like, another way of saying 'got together'.) 2. So, like, I was all, 'Yo guys, me and my squad were straight up beefing with the Ammonites, ya know? And when I hit you up for backup, you totally ghosted me and bailed. Not cool, dudes. 3. So, when I peeped that you all didn't come through for me, I took a huge risk and went head-to-head with the Ammonites. And guess what? The big man upstairs, AKA the LORD, totally had my back and helped me defeat them. So tell me, what's the dealio? Why are you all trying to pick a fight with me now? 4. So Jephthah brought all the guys from Gilead together and went up against Ephraim. The guys from Gilead totally owned Ephraim because they were dissing them, saying that the Gileadites were just losers hanging out with Ephraim and Manassites. 5. And the Gileadites totally owned the Jordan crossings before the Ephraimites: and it was like, when those Ephraimites who survived were like, 'Let me pass'; the Gileadite guys were all like, 'Are you, like, totally an Ephraimite? If he said, 'No,'; 6. Then they were like, yo say 'Shibboleth' and he was like 'Sibboleth' because he couldn't pronounce it right. So they grabbed him and killed him at the Jordan riverside. And at that time, a whopping forty-two thousand Ephraimites bit the dust. 7. So like, Jephthah was in charge of Israel for, like, six years. But then, you know, he passed away and they buried him in one of those cities in Gilead. 8. Then there was this cool dude named Ibzan from Bethlehem who totally ruled as a judge over Israel. 9. So this guy had, like, 30 sons and 30 daughters. He decided to let them venture out into the world, meeting new people and stuff. Then, he brought back 30 daughters from different places for his sons to marry. And he ruled over Israel for a solid seven years. 10. And Ibzan passed away, and he was laid to rest in Bethlehem. 11. Then there was Elon, from Zebulon, holding it down as judge over Israel for a solid decade. Respect! 12. And Elon, who was from Zebulun, passed away and was laid to rest in Aijalon, which is in the land of Zebulun. 13. Then there was this dude named Abdon, son of Hillel, from Pirathon, who was in charge of keeping the Israelites in check. 14. He had a total of forty sons and thirty nephews, all riding on a whopping seventy young donkeys. And this cool dude ruled over Israel for a solid eight years. (FYI, nephews here means sons' sons, in case you were wondering.) 15. And Abdon, Hillel's son from Pirathon, passed away and was laid to rest in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, on the mount of the Amalekites. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 121. And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire. {gathered...: Heb. were called} 2. And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands. 3. And when I saw that ye delivered {me} not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me? 4. Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites {are} fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, {and} among the Manassites. 5. And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was {so}, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, {Art} thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; 6. Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce {it} right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand. 7. And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in {one of} the cities of Gilead. 8. And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 9. And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, {whom} he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. 10. Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem. 11. And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. 12. And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun. 13. And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel. 14. And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years. {nephews: Heb. sons' sons} 15. And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 131. So, the Israelites messed up big time once again and it ticked off the LORD. As a consequence, the LORD allowed the Philistines to totally wreck them for a whopping forty years. Yep, things were definitely not looking great. 2. So, there was this dude from Zorah, representing the Danites squad. His name was Manoah and his wife couldn't have kids, like she was straight up barren. 3. So this angel from the LORD showed up to the woman and was like, 'Yo, listen up! Right now, you're not able to have kids and stuff. BUT in the future, you're gonna get pregnant and have a son.' 4. Yo, like, listen up! I gotta warn ya, don't be playin' with that wine or strong drink, and stay away from any unclean food, okay? 5. Yo, listen up! So, like, you're gonna get pregnant and give birth to a son, right? And here's the deal: no shaving his head, okay? 'Cause this kiddo is gonna be super devoted to God from day one, like a Nazarite! And get this, he's gonna start freeing Israel from the Philistines' control. How awesome is that? 6. So this lady went up to her man and was like, 'Babe, listen up. I had this encounter with this total God-sent dude. Lemme tell ya, his vibe was straight up angelic, but also kinda intimidating, ya know? Anyways, he didn't spill where he was from or his name or anything, like mysterious much? Just had to share, fam. 7. But he's like, 'Yo, listen up! You're gonna get pregnant and have a son, but here's the deal: no alcohol, no party drinks, and no eating anything unclean. This kid is gonna be a cool Nazarite for God from birth till death, no joke.' 8. So Manoah was like, yo LORD, please bring back that man of God you sent and show us what we should do when the baby comes. 9. God listened to what Manoah said, and then the angel of God returned to the woman who was chilling in the field. But her husband, Manoah, wasn't there. 10. So, the woman was like super pumped and started running to find her husband. She was like, 'Yo, dude! Listen up! The same guy who showed up at our place the other day? Well, guess what? He just showed up again! Can you believe it? Seriously!' 11. So Manoah got up and followed his wife to meet the guy and asked him, 'Are you the dude who was talking to my woman?' And he replied, 'Yeah, it's me.' 12. Manoah was like, 'Okay, cool, let your words come true. But how are we supposed to raise this kid? What do we do with him?' 13. And the angel of the LORD was like, 'Yo, Manoah, listen up. Whatever I told your wife, she better be careful and pay attention.' 14. She can't eat anything that comes from grapes, and she can't have wine, or other alcoholic drinks, or eat anything that's considered unclean. She needs to follow all the rules I gave her. 15. Manoah was like, 'Yo, angel of the LORD, can you hang with us for a bit while we prepare a dope meal for you? Like, a lit roasted kid. Yeah, that's what's up. For real.' 16. The angel of the LORD told Manoah, like, even if you try to feed me, I won't eat your food. And if you want to make a burnt offering, make sure you offer it to the LORD. 'Cause Manoah had no idea the angel was from the LORD, you know? 17. Manoah was like, 'Hey, angel of the LORD, what's your name? So we can show you some respect when your predictions come true? 18. And the angel vibe was like, 'Yo, why you trippin' and all up in my business, tryna know my name? Like, it's lowkey classified info, you know? (or actually, it's like super dope) 19. So Manoah brought a goat with a tasty offering and offered it on a rock to the LORD. And the angel did some amazing stuff, while Manoah and his wife watched. 20. When the fire went up from the altar towards the sky, something amazing happened: the angel of the LORD went up in the fire. Manoah and his wife saw this and couldn't help but drop down to the ground in awe. 21. But the angel of the LORD ghosted Manoah and his wife. That's when Manoah realized that the angel was legit. 22. Manoah was like, 'Babe, we're totally doomed! We just caught a glimpse of God and that's a big no-no!' 23. But his wife was like, 'Yo, if the LORD really wanted to wipe us out, I don't think He would've accepted our burnt offering and meat offering, or shown us all these crazy signs and spills the tea on these current happenings.' 24. So like, the woman had a baby boy and named him Samson. And as he grew up, the LORD blessed him, you know. 25. And the LORD's vibe started hitting him from time to time in the Dan camp, located between Zorah and Eshtaol. {the camp...: Hebrew text: Mahanehdan} \n",
      "KJV: Judges 131. And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years. {did evil...: Heb. added to commit, etc} 2. And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name {was} Manoah; and his wife {was} barren, and bare not. 3. And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou {art} barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son. 4. Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean {thing}: 5. For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines. 6. Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance {was} like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he {was}, neither told he me his name: 7. But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean {thing}: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death. 8. Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born. 9. And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband {was} not with her. 10. And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the {other} day. 11. And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, {Art} thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I {am}. 12. And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and {how} shall we do unto him? {How shall we order...: Heb. What shall be the manner of the, etc} {how shall we do...: or, what shall he do?: Heb. what shall be his work?} 13. And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware. 14. She may not eat of any {thing} that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean {thing}: all that I commanded her let her observe. 15. And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee. {for thee: Heb. before thee} 16. And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he {was} an angel of the LORD. 17. And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What {is} thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour? 18. And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it {is} secret? {secret: or, wonderful} 19. So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered {it} upon a rock unto the LORD: and {the angel} did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on. 20. For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on {it}, and fell on their faces to the ground. 21. But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he {was} an angel of the LORD. 22. And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. 23. But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these {things}, nor would as at this time have told us {such things} as these. 24. And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him. 25. And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol. {the camp...: Heb. Mahanehdan} \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 141. So Samson went to Timnath and spotted this girl from the Philistines while he was there. 2. So, like, he went to his parents and was all like, 'Guys, you won't believe it! I saw this amazing girl from Timnath, and she's, like, a total catch! Can you, like, arrange for me to marry her?' 3. So Samson's parents asked him, 'Why don't you find a wife from our own people or among your relatives? Why do you want to marry a Philistine, who isn't circumcised?' But Samson insisted, 'I really like her, Dad. Get her for me.' 4. But his parents had no clue that God was orchestrating this whole thing for an epic showdown with the Philistines - they were totally calling the shots at that time in Israel. 5. So Samson, with his parents, went to Timnath and arrived at the vineyards. Suddenly, this wild young lion comes out of nowhere and starts roaring at him! Like, can you believe it?! 6. Then the LORD's Spirit totally took over him, and he tore that dude apart like it was no biggie, with nothing in his hand. But, he kept it on the DL and didn't tell his parents what went down. 7. So he went over to talk to the lady, and she totally clicked with Samson. 8. After a while, he came back to claim her, and he took a detour to check out the dead lion's body. And guess what? He found a legit swarm of bees and honey in that lion's carcass. 9. Then he grabbed some in his hands, kept munching, and headed over to his folks. He handed them some, they chowed down, but he didn't spill the beans that he scooped out the honey from a lion's dead body. 10. So his dad went to hang out with the woman, and Samson threw a lit party because that's how the homies rolled back then. 11. And like, when they spotted him, they totally brought along thirty homies to hang with him. 12. So, like, Samson was all like, 'Hey guys, I have a super cool riddle for you! If you can totally solve it during the whole seven-day feast thingy, I'll hook you up with thirty sheets and thirty sets of clothes, you feel me?' 13. But if you can't figure it out, then you'll have to give me thirty cool outfits and thirty fresh kicks. And they said to him, Spill the tea with your riddle, so we can hear it. (outfits: or, shirts) 14. And he was like, yo, out of this big creature came some bomb food, and out of this super tough dude came some fire sweetness. But like, for real, those peeps couldn't figure out the riddle for three whole days. 15. So, on the seventh day, they went up to Samson's wife and said, 'Yo, convince your husband to spill the beans on the riddle, or else we'll totally light you and your fam on fire. Did you invite us here just to jack our stuff? Like, seriously, is it not obvious? Are you planning to rob us or something?'} 16. Samson's wife was totally crying and she was like, 'OMG, you just straight up hate me! You gave the homies a riddle but you didn't even tell me about it! Like, seriously?' And Samson was like, 'Hold up! I didn't even tell my own parents about it. Why would I spill the tea to you?' 17. And she was like crying in front of him for a whole week, while their party was going on. Then, on the seventh day, he couldn't take it anymore and spilled the beans because she was pressuring him so much. And she went on to share the riddle with her own crew. 18. And the guys from the city were like, yo dude on the seventh day, right before sunset, they were like, what's sweeter than honey? and what's more power than a lion? And he was like, yo listen up, if y'all didn't mess with my girl, you wouldn't have figured out my riddle. 19. Then the LORD's spirit totally empowered him, and he went down to Ashkelon and totally slayed thirty dudes, snagged their stuff, and gave cool clothes to those who solved the riddle. He was super ticked off, so he went back to his dad's crib. {stuff: or, clothes} 20. But Samson's wife was, like, taken away and given to his buddy, who he had been chillin' with. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 141. And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. 2. And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife. 3. Then his father and his mother said unto him, {Is there} never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well. {pleaseth...: Heb. is right in mine eyes} 4. But his father and his mother knew not that it {was} of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel. 5. Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared against him. {against...: Heb. in meeting him} 6. And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and {he had} nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done. 7. And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well. 8. And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, {there was} a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion. 9. And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion. 10. So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do. 11. And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him. 12. And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast, and find {it} out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments: {sheets: or, shirts} 13. But if ye cannot declare {it} me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it. {sheets: or, shirts} 14. And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days expound the riddle. 15. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have? {is it} not {so}? {take...: Heb. possess us, or, impoverish us?} 16. And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told {it} me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told {it} my father nor my mother, and shall I tell {it} thee? 17. And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people. {the seven...: or, the rest of the seven days} 18. And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What {is} sweeter than honey? and what {is} stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle. 19. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house. {spoil: or, apparel} 20. But Samson's wife was {given} to his companion, whom he had used as his friend. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 151. So, like, a little bit later during wheat harvest time, Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat. And he was all like, 'Yo, I'm gonna go chill with my wife in the bedroom.' But her dad was like, 'Nah fam, you can't come in.' 2. And her dad was like, I honestly thought you totally despised her, so I hooked her up with your homie. But yo, isn't her younger sis way hotter? Can you please just take her instead? Let her be yours, ya know? 3. And Samson was like, listen, I may not be perfect, but compared to those Philistines, I'm way more blameless, even if I piss them off. #JustSayin 4. So Samson went and caught 300 foxes, then he grabbed some fire gadgets and tied their tails together. And he put a fire gadget in the middle, right between their tails. 5. And when he lit up the brands, he released them into the Philistines' field, and burned down both the stacks and the crops, including the vineyards and olive trees. 6. The Philistines were like, 'Yo, who did this?' And the answer was Samson, the dude who married the Timnite girl and then gave her to his bro. So, the Philistines rolled up and straight up burned both her and her father with fire. 7. And Samson was like, yo, even though you did me dirty, I'm still gonna get payback on you, but then I'm done with this whole situation. 8. And he totally wrecked them with a massive beatdown: then he dipped out and set up camp on the highest peak of rock Etam. 9. So the Philistines came and set up camp in Judah, spreading out in Lehi. 10. The dudes from Judah were like, why you tryna mess with us? And they were like, we here to capture Samson, payback for all the stuff he did to us. 11. So, like, 3000 dudes from Judah mobbed up to the rock Etam and were like, 'Yo, Samson, don't you know we're living under the Philistines' rule? What the heck did you just do to us?' And Samson was all like, 'Bro, they did the same to me, so I just gave it back to them.' 12. And they were like, 'Yo, bro, we came here to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.' And Samson was like, 'Look, swear on your lives that you won't attack me yourselves.' 13. They're like, 'Nah, we won't kill you, but we're gonna tie you up real tight and hand you over to 'em.' So, they tied him up with these fresh new cords and carried him up from the rock. 14. And when he arrived at Lehi, the Philistines started making a lot of noise to try and intimidate him. But then, the Spirit of the LORD came upon him with great power, and the ropes that were tied around his arms became as weak as burnt flax, and his hands were set free from the restraints. 15. Then he came across a fresh donkey jawbone, so he reached out, grabbed it, and used it to defeat a thousand dudes. By the way, 'new' in Hebrew means 'moist.' 16. And Samson was like, check it, I straight up wrecked a thousand dudes using just an ass's jawbone. It was insane, you know, heaps upon heaps, like two big stacks of defeated enemies. That's how I rolled. 17. So, like, when he finished talking, he totally chucked the jawbone out of his hand and named that spot Ramathlehi. (BTW, that means lifting up the jawbone or, you know, casting it away.) 18. And he was really thirsty, so he reached out to the LORD and said, 'You've totally helped me out by giving me this awesome victory! But seriously, am I gonna die of thirst now and end up in the hands of the uncircumcised?' 19. So, like, God opened up this hole in the dude's jaw and water came out, and after he drank it, he felt all refreshed and revived. That's why he named the place Enhakkore, which is still called that in Lehi. Enhakkore means, like, the well of the guy who cried out or something. Oh, and by the way, Lehi is the name used in this chapter for the jaw, just FYI. 20. And he ran the show in Israel while the Philistines were running the game for a solid twenty years. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 151. But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in. 2. And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: {is} not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her. {take...: Heb. let her be thine} 3. And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. {more...: or, blameless from the Philistines though, etc} 4. And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails. {firebrands: or, torches} 5. And when he had set the brands on fire, he let {them} go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards {and} olives. 6. Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. 7. And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease. 8. And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam. 9. Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi. 10. And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us. 11. Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines {are} rulers over us? what {is} this {that} thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them. {went: Heb. went down} 12. And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves. 13. And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock. 14. {And} when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that {were} upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands. {loosed: Heb. were melted} 15. And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith. {new: Heb. moist} 16. And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men. {heaps upon...: Heb. an heap, two heaps} 17. And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi. {Ramathlehi: that is, the lifting up of the jawbone, or, casting away of the jawbone} 18. And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised? 19. But God clave an hollow place that {was} in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which {is} in Lehi unto this day. {Enhakkore: that is, the well of him that called or, cried} {the jaw: or, Lehi, as called in this chapter} 20. And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 161. So Samson traveled to Gaza and came across a prostitute. He decided to spend some time with her. 2. So like, word got out to the Gazites that Samson came into town. They totally surrounded him and set up an ambush at the city gate, keeping quiet all night. They were like, 'Yeah, we'll wait till morning and then take him out.' (PSA: 'quiet' here means 'silence') 3. So Samson stayed up until midnight, then he got up and took the city gate doors, including the two posts, and carried them away with the metal bar. He put them on his shoulders and brought them up to the top of a hill near Hebron. 4. So, like, after that, there was this guy who totally fell for this girl in the valley of Sorek, and her name was Delilah. You know, like, by the brook and stuff. 5. So the big shots from the Philistines went to her and said, 'Get him to fall for you and find out where his unbeatable power comes from, and how we can overcome him, so we can tie him up and make him suffer. And if you help us, we'll each give you 1100 silver coins.' 6. So, like, Delilah was all like, 'Hey Samson, spill the tea, dude! Where's the secret source of your power, and what can we use to tie you up and bring you down?' 7. And Samson was like, yo girl, if they tie me up with some fresh green cords that have never been dried, I'm gonna lose my strength and be as weak as an average dude. #NotFeelingIt 8. So the Philistine bosses grabbed seven fresh green ropes and used them to tie him up. (These ropes were not dry yet.) 9. So, like, there were these dudes hiding in her room, you know? And she was like, 'Yo, Samson, the Philistines are totally trying to get you!' And then he just snapped those ropes, like how a thin piece of cloth breaks when it touches fire. And nobody knew about his insane strength, man. (By the way, 'toucheth' means 'smelleth' in Hebrew, just FYI) 10. So, like, Delilah was all like, 'Dude, you totally made fun of me and lied to me. Now spill, I beg you, how can I tie you up?' 11. And he was like, 'Yo, if they tie me up real tight with brand new ropes that no one has ever used before, then I'll lose my strength and be as weak as any other dude. Like, those ropes better not have been used for any work or anything.' 12. So Delilah grabbed some fresh ropes and tied him up with them. She whispered, 'Hey Samson, the Philistines are coming for you.' Meanwhile, sneaky folks were hiding in the room, ready to ambush. But Samson ripped the ropes off his arms as easily as tearing a flimsy thread. 13. Delilah was like, 'Samson, you've been playing with me and lying to me. Tell me how to tie you up.' And Samson was all, 'If you braid the seven locks of my hair with a web-like rope.' 14. Then she secured it with the pin and said to him, 'The Philistines are coming, Samson!' And he woke up from his sleep and escaped with the pin and the piece of fabric. 15. She was like, 'Seriously, how can you say you love me when you're not even committed? You've played me three times and still haven't spilled the beans on where your strength comes from.' 16. And this happened, when she kept nagging him every day with her words, and pressuring him so much that he felt incredibly stressed out to the point of feeling like he couldn't take it anymore; so stressed that it felt like his life was being cut short. 17. So, like, he opened up to her completely and was all like, 'Yo, I've never used a razor on my head, bro! I've been devoted to God as a Nazarite since I was born, you know? If I shave my head, my strength will be gone and I'll become weak, just an ordinary dude.' 18. And when Delilah peeped that he spilled all his deep secrets, she hit up the Philistine bosses like, 'Yo, come through this one time, 'cause he straight up spilled all his secrets to me.' So the Philistine bosses rolled up to her, holding that cash in their hands. 19. And she made him crash on her legs, and she called a dude to give him a fresh buzz cut, taking off all seven locks of his epic hairdo. Then she straight up started messing with him, and he lost all of his strength. 20. Yo, she straight up said, 'Yo Samson, the Philistines are coming for you!' And Samson woke up from his beauty sleep like, 'No worries fam, I got this. I'll do my usual routine and flex real hard.' Little did he know, he had no idea that the Lord had actually left him. 21. The Philistines snagged him, blinded him, and dragged him to Gaza, where they shackled him with brass chains. He was stuck grinding in the slammer. 22. But, like, his hair totally started growing again after it got shaved. You know, right after that happened. 23. So, like, all the big shots of the Philistines got together to, you know, throw this huge party to honor their boss god, Dagon. They were all stoked because they were like, 'Dude, our god totally handed Samson, our archenemy, over to us!' 24. When the people caught sight of him, they totally hyped up their deity, 'cause they were like, 'Yo, our god totally came through! He handed over our enemy, the one who wrecked our land and took out so many of us. Like, seriously, our deaths were multiplying!' 25. And like, when they were feeling all hyped and stuff, they were like, 'Yo, let's call Samson to entertain us!' So they legit called Samson out of the prison, and he started entertaining them, you know. And they like placed him between the pillars. (BTW, 'them' here means like right in front of them, just clarifying for ya) 26. Samson was like, 'Yo dude, let me check out those pillars that keep this place standing. I wanna chillax and lean on 'em.' 27. So, like, the whole house was packed with guys and girls, and, dude, all the Philistine big shots were there, you know? And on the rooftop, there were about three thousand dudes and dudettes, just chilling and watching Samson do his thing, man. 28. Then Samson reached out to the LORD and said, 'Yo, Lord GOD, hook me up with some strength just this one time, O God. I need to get back at those Philistines for taking my eyes.' 29. So, Samson grabbed onto the two pillars in the middle of the house, the ones that were holding it up. He took hold of one with his right hand and the other with his left. (By the way, he was leaning on them.) 30. Samson's like, yo, let me go out with a bang! He put all his strength into it and the whole house came crashing down on the rulers and everyone inside. Turns out, he actually took out more people in his final act than he did during his whole life. Talk about intense! 31. So, like, his bros and fam all came, ya know, and they took him and gave him a proper send-off, burying him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the place where Manoah, his dad, was laid to rest. And get this, he ruled over Israel for a solid 20 years, no cap! \n",
      "KJV: Judges 161. Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in unto her. {harlot: Heb. a woman an harlot} 2. {And it was told} the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And they compassed {him} in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him. {quiet: Heb. silence} 3. And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put {them} upon his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that {is} before Hebron. {bar...: Heb. with the bar} 4. And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name {was} Delilah. {in...: or, by the brook} 5. And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength {lieth}, and by what {means} we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him: and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred {pieces} of silver. {afflict: or, humble} 6. And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy great strength {lieth}, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee. 7. And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. {green...: or, new cords: Heb. moist} {another: Heb. one} 8. Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them. {green...: or, new cords: Heb. moist} 9. Now {there were} men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines {be} upon thee, Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known. {toucheth: Heb. smelleth} 10. And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be bound. 11. And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man. {that never...: Heb. wherewith work hath not been done} 12. Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines {be} upon thee, Samson. And {there were} liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his arms like a thread. 13. And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web. 14. And she fastened {it} with the pin, and said unto him, The Philistines {be} upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web. 15. And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart {is} not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength {lieth}. 16. And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words, and urged him, {so} that his soul was vexed unto death; {vexed: Heb. shortened} 17. That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I {have been} a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any {other} man. 18. And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand. 19. And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him. 20. And she said, The Philistines {be} upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him. 21. But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did grind in the prison house. {put out: Heb. bored out} 22. Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven. {after...: or, as when he was shaven} 23. Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand. 24. And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the destroyer of our country, which slew many of us. {which...: Heb. and who multiplied our slain} 25. And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars. {them: Heb. before them} 26. And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I may lean upon them. 27. Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of the Philistines {were} there; and {there were} upon the roof about three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport. 28. And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes. 29. And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right hand, and of the other with his left. {on which...: or, he leaned on them} 30. And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed himself with {all his} might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that {were} therein. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than {they} which he slew in his life. {me: Heb. my soul} 31. Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and took him, and brought {him} up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 171. So, there was this dude from mount Ephraim, and his name was Micah. Like, legit! 2. So, like, he told his mom, 'Yo, remember that 1,100 silver shekels that got swiped from you? The ones you got all mad about and talked to me about? Well, guess what, I got 'em. I took 'em.' And his mom was like, 'Wow, thanks to the Lord, you're totally blessed, my son.' 3. So, like, once he gave back the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mom, she was like, 'OMG, I totally set aside that silver for the Lord, to like, make a statue or something. So, here, I'm giving it back to you.' 4. But he gave the money back to his mom, and she took two hundred silver coins and gave them to the craftsman. The craftsman then used them to make a carved statue and a metal statue, which ended up in Micah's house. 5. So there was this dude named Micah who had a wicked cool crib filled with idols and stuff. He even made his own fancy robe called an ephod and these little statues called teraphim. He even appointed one of his sons to be his chief priest. #familybusiness 6. Back in the day, there was no big boss ruling over Israel, so everyone just did whatever they believed was right for themselves. 7. There was this dude from Bethlehemjudah, part of the fam of Judah, who was a total Levite and crashed there for a while. 8. And the guy left the city of Bethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he could crash, and he ended up heading to Mount Ephraim to Micah's crib along the way. 9. And Micah was like, 'Yo, where you comin' from?' And the dude was like, 'I'm a Levite from Bethlehemjudah, and I'm just wanderin' around lookin' for a place to crash.' 10. And Micah was like, yo dude, come chill with me and be like a dad and a priest to me. I'll hook you up with ten silver coins every year, a dope outfit, and all your meals covered. So the Levite was down and went with him. Micah even got him a whole new wardrobe, like a fresh 'fit. 11. And the Levite was like, totally cool with staying with the dude; and the young man was like, his homie and stuff, just like one of his own sons. 12. So Micah made the Levite legit, and the young dude became his priest, chillin' in Micah's crib. 13. Micah was like, 'Yo, now I know for real that the LORD is gonna bless me, 'cause I got a Levite as my priest! \n",
      "KJV: Judges 171. And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name {was} Micah. 2. And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred {shekels} of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver {is} with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed {be thou} of the LORD, my son. 3. And when he had restored the eleven hundred {shekels} of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. 4. Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred {shekels} of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah. 5. And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. {consecrated: Heb. filled the hand} 6. In those days {there was} no king in Israel, {but} every man did {that which was} right in his own eyes. 7. And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who {was} a Levite, and he sojourned there. 8. And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find {a place}: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. {as he...: Heb. in making his way} 9. And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I {am} a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find {a place}. 10. And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten {shekels} of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in. {a suit...: or, a double suit, etc: Heb. an order of garments} 11. And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. 12. And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. 13. Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to {my} priest. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 181. Back in the day, Israel had no king. The Danites were on a quest to find their own land to settle in, because up until that time, they hadn't received any inheritance among the other tribes of Israel. 2. So the Danites, who were pretty brave, chose five guys from their crew who lived in Zorah and Eshtaol. They gave them the mission to check out the land and explore it. They were like, 'Go ahead, scope out the scene.' When these five dudes arrived at Mount Ephraim, they crashed at Micah's crib for the night. 3. So, like, when they were near Micah's crib, they recognized the voice of the young Levite dude. They rolled up and asked him, 'Yo, who brought you here? What's your deal in this spot? And what's up with all your stuff?' 4. And he was like, yo, Micah is treating me like this, he straight up hired me to be his priest. 5. And they were like, 'Hey, dude, you should totally seek advice from God, you know, just to find out if our plans will be a success or not.' 6. And the priest was like, 'You guys chill and peace out: because God's got your back and will guide you on your journey.' 7. So the five guys went to Laish and saw the people there living carefree, just like the Zidonians. They were chill and felt safe, without any authority figures to keep them in check. They were far from the Zidonians and didn't have any dealings with anyone. (Laish was also known as Leshem btw and when I say authority figures, I mean those who could put them to shame or tell them what to do) 8. So they arrived at Zorah and Eshtaol to meet up with their friends. And their friends asked them, 'Yo, what's up? What's the scoop?'} 9. So they were like, 'Yo, let's go up against them because we checked out the land and it's legit amazing. And seriously, are you still just chilling? Don't be lazy, get up and go take control of the land.' 10. When you go, you'll be heading to a chill place with a ton of space—God totally handed it to you! It's a spot where you won't be lacking anything the earth has to offer. 11. So, like, six hundred totally badass dudes from the Danite fam, straight up bounced from Zorah and Eshtaol. And let me tell you, they were armed and ready for some serious combat. Talk about ready to slay! 12. So they rolled up and settled in Kirjathjearim, in Judah, so they named that spot Mahanehdan up until now. Look, it's just behind Kirjathjearim. 13. And they went to mount Ephraim, and arrived at Micah's crib. 14. So, like, those five dudes who scoped out the land of Laish, they spill the tea to their homies and they're like, 'Yo, did you know that these houses have, like, this ephod thingy, and some teraphim, and, hold up, even a carved and melted statue? Like, seriously, think about what we gotta do now.' 15. So they went there and arrived at the crib of this cool Levite guy, like, right at Micah's place, and they said what's up to him. Like, they asked if everything was chill, you know, peace and all that. 16. So, like, there were these six hundred dudes from the tribe of Dan who were totally armed and ready for battle, and they were hanging out at the entrance of the gate. 17. So, like, these five dudes went to check out the land, right? They went up, and then they went in there, and they straight up took this carved statue thing, this fancy robe thing, and these weird idol things. Oh, and meanwhile, the priest was just chilling by the entrance of the gate with these six hundred dudes who were armed for battle. 18. So these guys went into Micah's crib and grabbed the statue, the merch, and the decorative figures, and the metal statue. Then the priest was like, 'What's your dealio?' 19. And they were like, dude, just chill, keep quiet and listen. Come with us and be like a rad combination of a father and a priest. Would you rather be a priest for just one guy, or be a priest for a whole tribe and family in Israel? 20. The priest was stoked and grabbed the dope accessories like the ephod, teraphim, and graven image, then went chillin' with the homies. 21. And then, they bounced outta there, making sure to put the young ones, the animals, and the fancy ride up front. 22. And when they were pretty far from Micah's crib, the guys that were chilling near Micah's crib came together and caught up with the Dan squad. 23. So the people of Dan were like, 'Hey Micah, what's up with all these people you've gathered?' They called out to him, wondering why he brought such a big crew with him. 24. And he was like, bro, you totally snatched my gods and the priest, and just dipped. And now you're asking me, what's wrong? Like, seriously, what's your deal? 25. Yo, Dan's crew was like, 'Bruh, keep it low-key, don't be all loud around us. 'Cause if some angry peeps catch wind of you, you and your fam might end up losing your lives. Straight up, angry folks be bitter in their souls, ya know.' 26. So, like the squad of Dan peaced out and when Micah realized he couldn't handle their power moves, he just bounced and went back home. 27. So, like, they totally snagged all the cool stuff that Micah made, including the priest he had, and went to this chill town called Laish where the people were just minding their own business and feeling safe. And, yeah, they straight up attacked them with swords and set the whole city on fire. 28. And like, there wasn't anyone to save them, 'cause it was like so far away from Zidon, and they had no connection with anyone, you know? And it was in this valley near Bethrehob. So they decided to build a city and settle there, ya feel? 29. So, they were like, 'Let's name the city Dan, 'cause that's their dad's name and he's, like, part of Israel. But, just so you know, the city's original name was Laish. 30. So, the Danites decided to put up a fancy statue while Jonathan, son of Gershom, grandson of Manasseh, and his kids, became the super cool priests for the Dan tribe until the land got captured. 31. And they put up Micah's carved statue, which he made, while the house of God was in Shiloh. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 181. In those days {there was} no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day {all their} inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel. 2. And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they lodged there. {men of: Heb. sons of} 3. When they {were} by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this {place}? and what hast thou here? 4. And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest. 5. And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous. 6. And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD {is} your way wherein ye go. 7. Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people that {were} therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and {there was} no magistrate in the land, that might put {them} to shame in {any} thing; and they {were} far from the Zidonians, and had no business with {any} man. {Laish: also called, Leshem} {magistrate: Heb. possessor, or, heir of restraints} 8. And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their brethren said unto them, What {say} ye? 9. And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it {is} very good: and {are} ye still? be not slothful to go, {and} to enter to possess the land. 10. When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where {there is} no want of any thing that {is} in the earth. 11. And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of war. {appointed: Heb. girded} 12. And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah: wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, {it is} behind Kirjathjearim. 13. And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the house of Micah. 14. Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do. 15. And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young man the Levite, {even} unto the house of Micah, and saluted him. {saluted...: Heb. asked him of peace} 16. And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war, which {were} of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate. 17. And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, {and} came in thither, {and} took the graven image, and the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men {that were} appointed with weapons of war. 18. And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the priest unto them, What do ye? 19. And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: {is it} better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel? 20. And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people. 21. So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them. 22. {And} when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that {were} in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan. 23. And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with such a company? {comest...: Heb. art gathered together?} 24. And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what {is} this {that} ye say unto me, What aileth thee? 25. And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the lives of thy household. {angry: Heb. bitter of soul} 26. And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they {were} too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house. 27. And they took {the things} which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people {that were} at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire. 28. And {there was} no deliverer, because it {was} far from Zidon, and they had no business with {any} man; and it was in the valley that {lieth} by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein. 29. And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city {was} Laish at the first. 30. And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land. 31. And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 191. So back in the day, when there was no king in Israel, there was this Levite dude chillin' on the side of Mount Ephraim. He got himself a side chick from Bethlehemjudah, if you catch my drift. 2. And his side chick completely betrayed him, and bounced from him to her old man's crib in Bethlehemjudah, and stayed there for a solid four months. {four whole months: or, a year and four months: Heb. days, four months} 3. And her husband got up and went after her, to talk nicely to her and bring her back, with his servant and a couple of donkeys. She brought him to her father's house and when the girl's father saw him, he was really happy to see him. 4. And the girl's dad, his father-in-law, let him stay; and he hung out with him for three days: so they grubbed and chilled, and crashed there. 5. So, on the fourth day, as soon as they woke up in the morning, he got up to leave. Then the girl's father told his soon-to-be son-in-law, like, grab a piece of bread to boost your spirits before you head out. 6. And they were just chilling, eating and drinking together, because the girl's dad was like, yo, dude, stay the night and have a good time, don't stress. 7. And like, when the guy was about to bounce, his father-in-law was all like, 'Nah man, you should crash here again.' 8. So, like, on the fifth day, he woke up super early to leave, and the girl's dad was all like, 'Chill out, dude. Relax.' And they hung out until the afternoon and had some grub together. Oh yeah, they stayed there until the sun started going down. Cool, right? 9. And when the guy was about to leave, he, his side chick, his servant, his father-in-law (the girl's dad) said to him, 'Hey, it's getting late in the day, why don't you stay the night? It's almost bedtime, so crash here and have a good time. Then, tomorrow morning, hit the road and head back to your crib.' 10. But the guy didn't stay the night, instead he got up and left. He went towards Jebus, which is Jerusalem. He had two saddled donkeys with him, and his concubine was with him too. 11. So, like, when they were near Jebus, it was getting late in the day, and the servant was all like, 'Hey boss, let's go chill in this city of the Jebusites and crash for the night.' 12. And the boss was like, 'Nah fam, we ain't gonna detour into some random city that's not even ours. Let's just head straight to Gibeah, you know?'} 13. So he's like, 'Yo, servant! Let's go find a place to crash for the night, whether it's in Gibeah or Ramah.' 14. And they like, moved on and like, went on their way; and the sun, like, went down on them when they were near Gibeah, which is part of Benjamin's turf. 15. So, they went there to crash in Gibeah, but when they arrived, they couldn't find a place to crash. Nobody offered them a spot in their crib. 16. So, check it out, there was this old man who finished his work in the field and came back in the evening. He was from Mount Ephraim and decided to stay in Gibeah. But just FYI, the people living there were all Benjamites. 17. So, like, this dude looked up and saw this random person wandering in the street of the city, ya know? And the old man was like, 'Where ya headed, bro? And where ya coming from?' 18. And he was like, yo, we're just traveling from Bethlehemjudah towards the side of mount Ephraim, like I'm heading there. So I went to Bethlehemjudah, but now I'm going to the house of the LORD, you know? And like, there's no one who's willing to host me, you feel me? 19. We've got straw and food for our donkeys, and there's also bread and wine for me, you, and the guy hangin' with your crew. We've got everything we need, no shortages here. 20. And the boomer dude was like, Yo, chillax, may peace be with you. If you need anything, just hit me up, man. Just don't crash in the street, that ain't cool. 21. Then he took him to his crib, and hooked them up with some grub for the donkeys: and they freshened up, chowed down, and quenched their thirst. 22. So, like, while they were having a good time and all, these shady dudes from the town came and surrounded the house. They were totally up to no good, banging on the door and telling the owner, this older guy, to hand over the dude who entered his house, so they could, like, mess with him or something. 23. And the dude, the boss of the crib, stepped out and said to them, 'Nah, my bros, seriously, don't do this evil stuff; this guy came into my house, so let's not do something stupid like this.' 24. Yo, check out my daughter and his concubine here. I'ma bring them out and y'all can do whatever you want with them, but don't do anything messed up to this man. That's just too far, man. 25. But the guys didn't listen to him, so the dude took his side chick and brought her out to them. They did some messed up stuff to her all night until morning. And when daylight started to break, they let her go. 26. Early in the morning, the woman arrived and collapsed at the man's doorstep, waiting until it got daylight. 27. The guy woke up in the morning, opened the doors, and went outside like usual. And guess what? His side chick was passed out at the doorstep with her hands touching the ground. 28. And he was like, 'Yo, let's bounce.' But nobody said anything back. So this dude picked her up and put her on a donkey, and they headed to where he lived. 29. And when he got home, he grabbed a knife and took hold of his side chick, and cut her into twelve pieces, along with her bones, and sent a piece to each part of Israel. 30. And it was like, everyone who saw it was like, OMG, there has never been such an epic thing that went down since the day the children of Israel left Egypt and like, till now. So, like, think about it, take some advice, and speak your minds, yo. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 191. And it came to pass in those days, when {there was} no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah. {a concubine: Heb. a woman a concubine, or, a wife a concubine} 2. And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four whole months. {four whole months: or, a year and four month: Heb. days, four months} 3. And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto her, {and} to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him. {friendly...: Heb. to her heart} 4. And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged there. 5. And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way. {Comfort: Heb. Strengthen} 6. And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry. 7. And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him: therefore he lodged there again. 8. And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart: and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them. {until afternoon: Heb. till the day declined} 9. And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go home. {draweth: Heb. is weak} {the day groweth to an end: Heb. it is the pitching time of the day} {home: Heb. to thy tent} 10. But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and departed, and came over against Jebus, which {is} Jerusalem; and {there were} with him two asses saddled, his concubine also {was} with him. {over against: Heb. to over against} 11. {And} when they {were} by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it. 12. And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger, that {is} not of the children of Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah. 13. And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah. 14. And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down upon them {when they were} by Gibeah, which {belongeth} to Benjamin. 15. And they turned aside thither, to go in {and} to lodge in Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for {there was} no man that took them into his house to lodging. 16. And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even, which {was} also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place {were} Benjamites. 17. And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and whence comest thou? 18. And he said unto him, We {are} passing from Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence {am} I: and I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I {am now} going to the house of the LORD; and there {is} no man that receiveth me to house. {receiveth: Heb. gathereth} 19. Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young man {which is} with thy servants: {there is} no want of any thing. 20. And the old man said, Peace {be} with thee; howsoever {let} all thy wants {lie} upon me; only lodge not in the street. 21. So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink. 22. {Now} as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, {and} beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know him. 23. And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and said unto them, Nay, my brethren, {nay}, I pray you, do not {so} wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly. 24. Behold, {here is} my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing. {so vile...: Heb. the matter of this folly} 25. But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go. 26. Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord {was}, till it was light. 27. And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down {at} the door of the house, and her hands {were} upon the threshold. 28. And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none answered. Then the man took her {up} upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him unto his place. 29. And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, {together} with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel. 30. And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and speak {your minds}. \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 201. Then all the Israelite squad rolled out, and the crew got together like one tight fam, from Dan to Beersheba, repping the Gilead territory, all the way to the LORD in Mizpeh. 2. And the big boss of all the cool peeps, like from every crew in Israel, came together in this epic gathering of God's squad. There were like four hundred thousand soldiers ready to throw down with their swords. 3. (So, like, the Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpeh.) And the Israelites were all like, 'Yo, spill the tea! Like, what's the deal with this wickedness?'} 4. The guy, who was married to the woman that got killed, replied and said, 'I went to Gibeah, which is a place in Benjamin, with my side chick, to stay for the night. Just so you know, I'm a Levite.' 5. So, like, the dudes from Gibeah totally came at me, surrounded my house in the dead of night, like they wanted to straight up murder me. And they straight up violated my concubine, she's dead now. It was messed up, man. 6. So, like, I totally took my concubine and split her into pieces, and sent those pieces all over the place in the land of Israel, ya know? 'Cause they were all doing some real nasty and stupid stuff over there, man. 7. Listen up, fam! We're all part of the Israel squad. Drop your thoughts and opinions right here. Let's share some knowledge and wisdom. 8. And all the people stood up together, like, 'No way we're going to anyone's crib, or like, chill in their pad.' 9. Yo, here's the plan for dealing with Gibeah: we'll roll the dice and take it on, no hesitation. 10. So we'll gather ten guys from every hundred in the tribes of Israel, and a hundred from every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to go grab some food for the people. They're gonna do something crazy in Gibeah of Benjamin to make up for all the dumb stuff they've done in Israel. 11. Like, all the dudes in Israel came together and formed this tight squad against the city. They were totally united and connected, just like one group. #squadgoals 🙌 12. So, like, the tribes of Israel were totally sending their peeps to check out what was happening in the tribe of Benjamin, and they were like, 'Dude, what's up with all this wickedness going on here? It's totally not cool!' 13. Yo, like, pass those dudes, the wicked ones from Gibeah, to us so we can totally get rid of them and remove all the bad vibes from Israel. But the peeps from Benjamin didn't wanna listen to their homies, the Israelites: 14. But like, the squad of Benjamin got their act together and rolled out of their hometowns to Gibeah, ready to go head-to-head with the Israel crew in battle. 15. So, like, at that time, there were about 26k sword-wielding dudes from the cities in Benjamin's crew, ya know? And that's not even counting the 700 badass chosen guys from Gibeah. 16. So, like, out of all these people, there were like seven hundred mega talented dudes who were left-handed. And get this, they were like expert slingers, capable of launching stones with incredible precision, not even missing by a hair's breadth. Like, so impressive, right? 17. And the guys from Israel, except Benjamin, were like 400K sword-wielding dudes: all of 'em were warriors. 18. So the Israelite squad got all pumped up and headed to God's crib. They were seeking some divine advice and asked, 'Yo, who's gonna be the leader for our epic battle face-off against the Benjamin crew?' God himself responded, 'It's gonna be Judah leading the charge, fam.' 19. So, like, the Israelites woke up bright and early, ready to take on Gibeah with their camping skills. 20. So, like, the dudes from Israel totally rolled out to battle against Benjamin. And they were all like, ready and positioned at Gibeah, all geared up for a fight. 21. So, like, the guys from Benjamin left Gibeah and totally wiped out, like, twenty-two thousand dudes from Israel that day. It was pretty intense. 22. And the dudes of Israel pumped themselves up and got ready for round two, positioning themselves in the same spot as they did on day one. 23. So, like, the people of Israel were all sad and stuff, and they cried to the LORD until it got dark. They were like, yo, LORD, should we fight the people of Benjamin, who are our own bros? And the LORD was all like, yeah, go and fight against them, man. 24. So the Israelites and the Benjaminites faced off again on the second day. 25. So Benjamin came out of Gibeah the next day and totally wrecked another 18K dudes from the Israelites. They all came ready with their swords and stuff. 26. So all the Israelite squad, and basically everyone, went up and rolled into the house of God. They were crying and just chilling there in front of the LORD. They decided to go on a fast the whole day till evening, and hooked up some burnt offerings and peace offerings to offer before the LORD. 27. So, the Israelites were like, 'yo, LORD, we gotta ask you something— the ark of the covenant of God, it's chillin' over there, right? 28. So Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and Aaron, stepped forward and questioned, 'Should I go into battle once more against the children of Benjamin, my own kin? Or should I quit fighting?' And the LORD replied, 'Go ahead, tomorrow I will ensure your victory.' 29. And Israel strategically positioned people to ambush around Gibeah. 30. So the Israelites, like, totally confronted the Benjaminites on the third day and got ready to fight in Gibeah, just like they do every other time. 31. So the squad from Benjamin flexed on their enemies and dipped out of the city. They straight up started attacking and taking down peeps on the regular like they always do, on the roads that lead to the house of God and to Gibeah in the field. They took out about thirty dudes from Israel. No cap, these battles were getting intense! 32. So, like, the Benjamin kids were all like, 'We totally crushed them, just like we did before!' But the Israelite squad was like, 'Nah fam, let's dip and lead them away from the city to the main roads.' 33. So, all the guys in Israel were like, Timee to step up!' They gathered themselves at Baaltamar, while the sneaky dudes of Israel sneaked out of their hiding spots, you know, chilling in the fields of Gibeah. 34. So, like, this big army of ten thousand carefully chosen dudes from all over Israel attacked Gibeah. The battle was, like, intense and stuff, but little did they know that trouble was creepin' up on 'em. 35. And God totally wrecked Benjamin in front of all Israel: The Israelite kids straight up annihilated 25k+ Benjamin dudes with their swords in a single day. It was intense. 36. Then the Benjamites realized they were being attacked, because the Israelite guys backed off and relied on their sneaky ambush near Gibeah. 37. And the sneaky group moved quickly and suddenly attacked Gibeah; they moved tactically and struck the entire city with their swords. They made a signal with the trumpet. 38. So basically, here's the deal: there was this secret signal planned between the dudes from Israel and the sneaky dudes hiding out, and the plan was to create this massive smoke-filled flame that would shoot up from the city. It was like their special way of communicating. 39. And when the guys from Israel backed off during the fight, Benjamin started attacking and killing around thirty guys from Israel. They thought they had us beat, just like in the first battle. 🤨 40. But yo, when the fire started blazing outta the city with a massive cloud of smoke, the Benjamites turned around and peeped that the whole place was straight up on fire, blazing all the way up to the sky. {the whole consumption of: meaning the whole darn thing was burnin'} 41. And when the guys from Israel turned around, the dudes from Benjamin were shooketh because they realized bad stuff was happening to them. #majorbummer 42. So they ran away from the men of Israel and went into the desert. But the fight caught up to them, and they destroyed everyone who came out of the cities right in the middle of them. 43. So, they totally surrounded the Benjamites and went after them, trampling them down without breaking a sweat near Gibeah, heading east. It was a total victory! 44. And like, so basically, there were like 18,000 awesome Benjamin dudes who got totally defeated in battle. They were all super brave and stuff. 45. And they quickly ran towards the wilderness to the epic hangout spot of Rimmon. They totally nabbed about five thousand dudes on the road and chased them down nonstop to Gidom, straight up taking out two thousand dudes from their crew. 46. On that day, a total of 25K dudes from Benjamin got wrecked in battle. And let me tell you, these guys were no joke, they were absolute badasses. 47. But like, six hundred dudes straight up bolted to the wilderness, man, and camped out at this place called Rimmon for four whole months, bro. 48. So the Israelite guys went back and attacked the guys from the tribe of Benjamin. They totally wrecked them with their swords, not only the guys in every city, but also the animals and anything they could get their hands on. And if that wasn't enough, they even set all the cities they came across on fire. (Just so you know, 'came to hand' means they found them, and 'they came' means they were found.) \n",
      "KJV: Judges 201. Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh. 2. And the chief of all the people, {even} of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword. 3. (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell {us}, how was this wickedness? 4. And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that {belongeth} to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge. {the Levite: Heb. the man the Levite} 5. And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, {and} thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead. {forced: Heb. humbled} 6. And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel. 7. Behold, ye {are} all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel. 8. And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any {of us} go to his tent, neither will we any {of us} turn into his house. 9. But now this {shall be} the thing which we will do to Gibeah; {we will go up} by lot against it; 10. And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel. 11. So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man. {knit...: Heb. fellows} 12. And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness {is} this that is done among you? 13. Now therefore deliver {us} the men, the children of Belial, which {are} in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel: 14. But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel. 15. And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men. 16. Among all this people {there were} seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair {breadth}, and not miss. 17. And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these {were} men of war. 18. And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah {shall go up} first. 19. And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah. 20. And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah. 21. And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men. 22. And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day. 23. (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.) 24. And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. 25. And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. 26. Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. 27. And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God {was} there in those days, 28. And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand. 29. And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah. 30. And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. 31. And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, {and} were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, {and} kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel. {to smite...: Heb. to smite of the people wounded as at, etc} {the house...: or, Bethel} 32. And the children of Benjamin said, They {are} smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways. 33. And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, {even} out of the meadows of Gibeah. 34. And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil {was} near them. 35. And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword. 36. So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah. 37. And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew {themselves} along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword. {drew...: or, made a long sound with the trumpet} 38. Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city. {sign: or, time} {and: Heb. with} {flame: Heb. elevation} 39. And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite {and} kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as {in} the first battle. {to smite...: Heb. to smite the wounded} 40. But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven. {the flame of: Heb. the whole consumption of} 41. And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them. {was come...: Heb. touched them} 42. Therefore they turned {their backs} before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which {came} out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them. 43. {Thus} they inclosed the Benjamites round about, {and} chased them, {and} trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising. {with ease...: or, from Menuchah, etc} {over...: Heb. unto over against} 44. And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these {were} men of valour. 45. And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them. 46. So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these {were} men of valour. 47. But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months. 48. And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of {every} city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to. {came to hand: Heb. was found} {they came...: Heb. were found} \n",
      "Gen Z: Judges 211. So, like, the dudes in Israel made this serious oath in Mizpeh. They were like, 'No way, bro! None of us are gonna let our daughters marry dudes from Benjamin.' 2. So, like, the peeps went to God's crib, and stayed there all day, straight up chilling with God. They started shouting and crying so hard, man, it was intense. 3. And they were like, yo Lord God of Israel, why is this happening in Israel? Like, why is there one tribe missing today? 4. The next day, the squad woke up super early and decided to go all out. They built this sick altar and made some epic burnt offerings and peace offerings, fam. 5. So, the Israelite squad was like, yo, which one of our peeps from all the tribes didn't show up to worship the Lord with the crew? They had made a serious promise that anyone who ditched the gathering and didn't come to Mizpeh to worship the Lord would get straight up executed. 6. So, like, the peeps of Israel felt hella sorry for Benjamin, their bro, and they were like, yo, it's whack that one tribe got totally cut off from Israel today! 7. Yo, how are we gonna find wives for the bros left, when we swore to the LORD that we wouldn't let 'em marry our daughters? 8. So they were like, yo, did any of the Israelite tribes not show up to Mizpeh to meet with the LORD? And, guess what, none of the peeps from Jabeshgilead came to join the crew at the camp. 9. So, like, they counted all the people and, like, guess what? None of the peeps from Jabeshgilead were there! Crazy, right? 10. So, like, the whole group sent a bunch of seriously tough dudes, like 12k of them, and they were told to go and, you know, attack those peeps living in Jabeshgilead. They were supposed to, like, use their swords and stuff and go after everyone, even the ladies and kiddos. 11. So here's what you gotta do: completely wipe out all the guys and any women who've been with a man. 12. So they came across four hundred young girls in Jabeshgilead who were still virgins, and had never been intimate with anyone. They brought them to the camp in Shiloh, which is in Canaan. 13. Then the entire squad hit up the kids from Benjamin chilling in rock Rimmon, slide into their DMs, and calmly reach out to vibe with them. (but like, in a chill way) 14. So Benjamin showed up once more, and they hooked him up with some wives from the women of Jabeshgilead that they had spared. But even then, there weren't enough ladies to go around. 15. And the peeps were like, oops, our bad for Benjamin, 'cause the big man upstairs caused a major divide among the Israelite squads. 16. So, like, the elders of the crew were all like, yo, how do we find wives for the dudes who are still single, 'cause all the girls from Benjamin got wiped out, you know? 17. And they were like, 'Yo, we gotta hook up our Benjamin squad with some land so their tribe doesn't get wiped out in Israel.' 18. But yo, we can't be hooking up our daughters with those Benjamin dudes because the Israelites swore up and down that anyone who gives a wife to a Benjamin bro is straight up cursed. 19. Yo, check it out, there's this lit party hosted by the LORD every year in Shiloh. It's located up north of Bethel, near the highway that goes from Bethel to Shechem, and just south of Lebonah. It goes down from year to year, and it's a prime spot east of the highway, facing the sunrising. 20. So they told the peeps from Benjamin, like yo, go and hide in the vineyards, ya know? 21. Yo, listen up! Check it out, if the girls from Shiloh decide to come out and bust a move on the dance floor, then leave your vines behind and each of you find yourself a wife from the girls of Shiloh, and head over to the land of Benjamin. 22. So, like, if their dads or bros come to us complaining, we'll be cool and say, 'Cut 'em some slack for our sake, okay? We didn't keep any wives for ourselves in the war. So it's not their fault, you know? Don't blame them.' 23. So, the people from Benjamin did just that. They got themselves some spouses from those who were busting moves on the dance floor, the ones they managed to catch. Then they made their way back to their ancestral land, fixed up the cities, and settled down in them. 24. So the Israelites left from there, each person going back to their own tribe and family, and they all went to claim their own land. 25. Back in the day, there was no king in Israel, so everyone just did whatever they thought was cool. \n",
      "KJV: Judges 211. Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife. 2. And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore; 3. And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel? 4. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 5. And the children of Israel said, Who {is there} among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death. 6. And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day. 7. How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives? 8. And they said, What one {is there} of the tribes of Israel that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly. 9. For the people were numbered, and, behold, {there were} none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there. 10. And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children. 11. And this {is} the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man. {hath lain...: Heb. knoweth the lying with man} 12. And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which {is} in the land of Canaan. {young...: Heb. young women virgins} 13. And the whole congregation sent {some} to speak to the children of Benjamin that {were} in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto them. {to speak...: Heb. and spake and called} {call...: or, proclaim peace} 14. And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so they sufficed them not. 15. And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. 16. Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of Benjamin? 17. And they said, {There must be} an inheritance for them that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of Israel. 18. Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed {be} he that giveth a wife to Benjamin. 19. Then they said, Behold, {there is} a feast of the LORD in Shiloh yearly {in a place} which {is} on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah. {yearly: Heb. from year to year} {on the east...: or, toward the sunrising} {of the highway: or, on the highway} 20. Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards; 21. And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. 22. And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, {that} ye should be guilty. {Be favourable...: or, Gratify us in them} 23. And the children of Benjamin did so, and took {them} wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the cities, and dwelt in them. 24. And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance. 25. In those days {there was} no king in Israel: every man did {that which was} right in his own eyes. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ruth 11. So, back in the old days when the judges were in charge, there was a major food shortage in the land. And there was this guy from Bethlehemjudah who decided to pack up and go to Moab with his wife and two sons to live for a while. Just so you know, when it says 'ruled,' it actually means 'judged' in Hebrew. 2. So this guy named Elimelech, his wife's name was Naomi, and they had two sons named Mahlon and Chilion. They were from Bethlehemjudah, and they decided to go to Moab and stay there for a while. 3. So, like, Elimelech, who was totally Naomi's husband, passed away, leaving her alone with their two sons. 4. So, they ended up marrying some Moabite wives, one named Orpah and the other named Ruth, and they lived there for like ten whole years. 5. So like, Mahlon and Chilion passed away, like totally both of them! And now the woman was left all alone without her two sons and her husband. 6. So, like, Naomi and her daughters-in-law left Moab to go back to their hometown because they heard that the Lord had like, totally shown kindness to his people by providing them with food and stuff. 7. So she and her two daughters-in-law left the place they were staying and started heading back to Judah. 8. So Naomi was like, 'Hey girls, it's time to go back to your mom's crib. May the LORD bless you both for being so cool to the deceased and to me.' 9. May the LORD give you all the vibes of chillness, so that each one of you can find some downtime with your significant other. After that, she gave them a hug and they couldn't help but cry their hearts out. 10. And they were like, for sure we gonna come with you to your squad. 11. Naomi was like, 'Listen up, my girls. Why you wanna roll with me? You think I got more sons in my belly waiting to be your baes?' 12. You know what, babes? Y'all should go on your own path, 'cause I'm way too old to find myself a man. Even if I wanted to, it's not like I'm gonna magically get married tonight and pop out some kids, ya feel me? 13. Wait around for these dudes until they're adults? Delay your chances of getting husbands? Nah, my girls, I'm so bummed because it seems like the Lord is totally against me.  14. And they started crying again, and Orpah gave her mother-in-law a kiss; but Ruth stuck by her side. 15. So, like, check it out, your sister-in-law, she like totally went back to her peeps and to her gods. You should def go after her, fam. 16. And Ruth was like, dude, don't even think about telling me to bounce and go back. Like, wherever you go, I'll go. And wherever you crash, I'll crash too. Your crew will be my crew, and your God will be my God, no cap. Don't even try to be against me, fam. 17. I'm totally down to die where you die and get buried there too. Like, seriously, if anything separates us except death, may God punish me big time. 18. When she realized that her friend was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to convince her. 19. So, like, the two of them went all the way to Bethlehem. And when they arrived, the whole city was like, shooketh by their presence. They were all like, 'Wait, is that Naomi?' 20. And she was like, don't even call me Naomi, call me Mara, 'cause God has been hella harsh with me. {Naomi, which means Pleasant} {Mara, yo, that means Bitter} 21. I started off with everything, but now I'm back with nothing, and you guys are still calling me Naomi? Don't you see that the Lord has spoken against me and I've been hit hard by the Almighty? 22. So Naomi went back to Bethlehem with her daughter-in-law Ruth, who came from Moab. They arrived at Bethlehem just as the barley harvest was starting. \n",
      "KJV: Ruth 11. Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. {ruled: Heb. judged} 2. And the name of the man {was} Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there. {continued: Heb. were} 3. And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. 4. And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one {was} Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years. 5. And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband. 6. Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread. 7. Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah. 8. And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me. 9. The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each {of you} in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. 10. And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people. 11. And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? {are} there yet {any more} sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands? 12. Turn again, my daughters, go {your way}; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, {if} I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons; {should have...: or were with an husband} 13. Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me. {tarry: Heb. hope} {it grieveth...: Heb. I have much bitterness} 14. And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her. 15. And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law. 16. And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, {or} to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people {shall be} my people, and thy God my God: {Intreat...: or, Be not against me} 17. Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, {if ought} but death part thee and me. 18. When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking unto her. {was...: Heb. strengthened herself} 19. So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, {Is} this Naomi? 20. And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. {Naomi: that is, Pleasant} {Mara: that is, Bitter} 21. I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why {then} call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me? 22. So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ruth 21. Naomi had this guy who was related to her late husband, and he was like, super rich and powerful. His fam was from the Elimelech crew, and his name was Boaz. (Boaz, also known as Booz in Greek slang) 2. So Ruth, this cool chick from Moab, told Naomi, 'Hey, I wanna go to the field and pick some corn in front of someone who will totally dig me.' And Naomi was like, 'Sure thing, my girl, go ahead.' 3. So she went and started picking up leftover crops in the field after the workers. Luckily, she ended up in a section of the field owned by Boaz, who was related to Elimelech. 4. Yo, check it out, Boaz just rolled up from Bethlehem and was like, 'Sup, my fellow reapers? May the LORD be with y'all.' And the reapers were like, 'Back at ya, man! May the LORD bless you!' 5. Boaz asked his servant in charge of the reapers, like yo, who's that girl over there? 6. And the person in charge of the workers replied, like, 'Oh, it's that Moab chick who rolled back with Naomi from Moab, you know?' 7. So she's like, 'Hey, can I join in and collect some leftover grain after the workers?'. And she's been at it since morning, chillin' with the crew, except for a quick break in the house. 8. Boaz was like, yo Ruth, you hear me? Don't even think about going to some other field to collect grain - stick around here with my girls, no need to bounce:  9. Just keep an eye on the field where they're harvesting and follow after them. Haven't I told the guys not to bother you? And if you're thirsty, feel free to grab a drink from the containers that the guys have filled up. 10. And she like, totally fell down on her face and bowed down, and was like, 'Why are you being so nice to me? I mean, I'm just a random stranger, like, why are you even bothering to notice me?'} 11. Boaz was like, 'Yo, I heard about all the awesome stuff you did for your mother-in-law ever since your hubby passed away. Leaving your parents and your hometown to come to this place with a bunch of strangers, respect!' 12. May the LORD bless and reward all your hard work, and may you receive a generous blessing from the LORD God of Israel, in whom you have found refuge. 13. Then she was like, 'Yo, can I get some love in your eyes, my dude? You've totally been there for me, and you've been mad chill with your words to your girl, even though I'm not like your other girls. {Can I get some...: or, Can I find} {chill: Hebrew literal translation: to the heart} 14. Boaz was like, 'Hey, come over here during lunch and grab some bread. Dip it in the vinegar if you want. Sit with the reapers.' So she joined the crew, and Boaz hooked her up with some roasted corn. She ate her fill and still had some leftovers. 15. So, like, when she got up to gather what was left behind, Boaz told his crew, like, 'Yo, let her pick from the good stuff, even among the piles, and don't give her any crap or anything, ya know?' 16. And, like, drop a few of those good vibes for her, and let her pick them up, without hating on her or anything. 17. So, like, she was gathering in the field until it got dark, and she separated all the stuff she gathered, and it was, like, a crazy amount of barley. 18. Then she picked it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gathered. So she brought it out and gave her what she had saved after she had eaten enough. 19. So her mother-in-law asks her, 'Where did you get all those goodies today? And where did you work? Major props to the person who noticed you.' And she spills the tea to her mother-in-law, saying, 'I worked with this guy named Boaz today.' 20. Naomi told her daughter-in-law, Praisee the Lord for the guy who hasn't stopped being kind to the living and the dead!' Naomi continued, 'He's actually a close relative of ours, one of our fam. He has the right to take care of us and make things right.' 21. So Ruth, this cool girl from Moab, was like, 'Yo, he straight up told me to stick with his crew until they finish all our harvest.' 22. And Naomi told Ruth, her daughter-in-law, 'Hey, girl, it's safe for you to hang out with the other ladies who work for him. This way, you won't randomly bump into them in some other field.' 23. So, she stuck around with her squad of Boaz's peeps and kept hustling until the barley and wheat harvest were over. She chilled with her mother-in-law during that time. \n",
      "KJV: Ruth 21. And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name {was} Boaz. {Boaz: Gr. Booz} 2. And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean ears of corn after {him} in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter. 3. And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field {belonging} unto Boaz, who {was} of the kindred of Elimelech. {hap...: Heb. hap happened} 4. And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD {be} with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee. 5. Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel {is} this? 6. And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It {is} the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: 7. And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in the house. 8. Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens: 9. {Let} thine eyes {be} on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of {that} which the young men have drawn. 10. Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I {am} a stranger? 11. And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and {how} thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore. 12. The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust. 13. Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens. {Let me...: or, I find} {friendly: Heb. to the heart} 14. And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers: and he reached her parched {corn}, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left. 15. And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not: {reproach...: Heb. shame her not} 16. And let fall also {some} of the handfuls of purpose for her, and leave {them}, that she may glean {them}, and rebuke her not. 17. So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley. 18. And she took {it} up, and went into the city: and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed. 19. And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day {is} Boaz. 20. And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed {be} he of the LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man {is} near of kin unto us, one of our next kinsmen. {one of...: or, one that hath right to redeem} 21. And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest. 22. And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, {It is} good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not in any other field. {meet...: or, fall upon thee} 23. So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ruth 31. Yo, Naomi (her mother-in-law) was like, 'Hey girl, shouldn't I try to find you some peace and happiness so that things work out for you?' 2. And BTW, isn't Boaz, like, one of our fam? You know, the dude you used to hang out with his squad? Well, guess what? He's gonna be doing some serious barley separating tonight at the threshing floor. 3. So, like, freshen up and look fly, put on your best outfit, and head down to the party. Just, you know, hide your identity until the dude is done grubbing and sipping. 4. When he's about to sleep, you gotta remember where he's gonna lie down. Then, you gotta slide in there, uncover his feet, and get comfy. Trust me, he's gonna spill all the info you need. 5. And she was like, 'Girl, I'm totally down! I'll do everything you tell me to do.' 6. So she went to the floor and did everything her mother-in-law told her to do. 7. And after Boaz finished eating and drinking, and he was feeling pretty good, he went to crash at the end of the pile of crops. Then she came over quietly, uncovered his feet, and laid down next to him. 8. So, like, in the middle of the night, this dude got super scared and turned around. And guess what? There was a woman lying right at his feet. Like, he grabbed hold of her or something, you know? 9. And he was like, 'Yo, who are you?' And she was like, 'Sup, I'm Ruth, your girl. Can you like, cover me with your skirt, because you're like fam and have the hookup to redeem me or something?' 10. And he was like, yo, you're so blessed by the big man upstairs, my girl. Like, you've shown way more love and kindness recently than before. I mean, you didn't go after all those young dudes, whether they were broke or loaded. 11. Hey girl, don't worry! I've got your back and I'll totally hook you up with whatever you need. 'Cause everyone knows you're a solid and righteous chick. The whole crew in our community knows it, you know? 12. So, like, it's actually true that I'm, you know, your close relative and all. But, um, there's actually someone who's an even closer relative than me. 13. Stay here tonight and in the morning, if he's down to be a bro and do what's right, let him do his bro duties. But if he's not gonna step up as a bro for you, then I'll step up and be a bro for you, swear on everything, chill out until morning. 14. And she stayed by his side till morning: and she got up before anyone could recognize each other. And he said, Let's keep it a secret that a girl came to the place. 15. Then he was like, yo, bring that thing you got on, and hold it. So she held it, and he gave her, like, six measures of barley, and put it on her. And she went into the city with it. 16. And when she finally reached her mother-in-law, she was like, 'Yo, who dis?', and she spilled all the tea about what the dude did to her. 17. So, like, she told me, he gave me these six portions of barley, because he was like, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed, okay?' 18. She was like, 'Chillax, my girl, don't stress until you see how it all plays out. This dude won't rest until he's done with what he's gotta do today.' \n",
      "KJV: Ruth 31. Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee? 2. And now {is} not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor. 3. Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: {but} make not thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking. 4. And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do. {uncover: or, lift up the clothes that are on} 5. And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do. 6. And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that her mother in law bade her. 7. And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down. 8. And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet. {turned: or, took hold on} 9. And he said, Who {art} thou? And she answered, I {am} Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou {art} a near kinsman. {a near...: or, one that hath right to redeem} 10. And he said, Blessed {be} thou of the LORD, my daughter: {for} thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich. 11. And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou {art} a virtuous woman. {city: Heb. gate} 12. And now it is true that I {am thy} near kinsman: howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than I. 13. Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, {that} if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, {as} the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning. 14. And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor. 15. Also he said, Bring the vail that {thou hast} upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six {measures} of barley, and laid {it} on her: and she went into the city. {vail: or, sheet, or, apron} 16. And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who {art} thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her. 17. And she said, These six {measures} of barley gave he me; for he said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law. 18. Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have finished the thing this day. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ruth 41. So Boaz went to the spot by the gate and chilled there. And guess what, the relative that Boaz talked about showed up; so Boaz was like, 'Yo, dude! Come over here, take a seat.' And sure enough, the guy turned aside and sat down. 2. Then he grabbed ten of the OGs from the town and was like, 'Take a seat, fam.' And they were like, 'Bet,' and chilled out. 3. So basically, this guy comes up to Naomi, who just came back from Moab, and tells her that she's selling a piece of land that belonged to our brother, Elimelech. 4. So I had this idea to let everyone know, like, you should totally buy it in front of all the people and the important ones from my crew. If you wanna be the one to buy it, go ahead and buy it. But if you're not interested, just let me know, you know? 'Cause no one else can buy it except for you, and I'm next in line. And then he was like, 'Yeah, I'll buy it.' 5. Yo, Boaz was like, 'Listen up! When you're buying that field from Naomi, you gotta scoop up Ruth the Moabitess too. She's the wife of the deceased, and you gotta make sure his name lives on through his inheritance.' 6. The relative was like, nah, I can't buy it back for myself 'cause it'll mess up my own inheritance. So, you go ahead and buy it back for yourself, 'cause I can't do it. 7. So back in the day in Israel, when someone wanted to make a deal or make things official, they had this cool tradition. They would take off their shoe and give it to their friend as a way of saying, 'Hey, this deal is legit!' It was like a special symbol of trust and testimony among the people of Israel. 8. So like, the relative told Boaz, 'Hey dude, go ahead and buy it.' And Boaz was like, 'Sure, man!' And then he took off his shoe. 9. So Boaz was like, yo elders and everyone, listen up! I just wanna make it clear today that I've totally scored all of Elimelech's stuff, and also Chilion and Mahlon's stuff, directly from Naomi herself. 10. So like, I totally bought Ruth, the Moabitess babe and wife of Mahlon, to be my wifey. My intention is to keep the name of the deceased alive on his property, so his name won't be forgotten by his peeps and won't disappear from the fam or the community. Y'all are totally witnesses to this, ya know! 11. And everyone at the entrance, including the older folks, said, 'We swear!' May the Lord bless the lady who came into your house, just like Rachel and Leah, who contributed to the growth of Israel. May you do great things in Ephratah and gain popularity in Bethlehem. May you become successful and well-known, spreading your name far and wide. 12. May your crib be as lit as Pharez's crib, whom Tamar slayed as a mom for Judah, representing the dope offspring that the LORD will bless you with from this baddie. 13. So Boaz and Ruth became a thing, and they got married. When they did the thing, the LORD blessed them with a baby boy. 14. And the women were like, OMG Naomi, you are so blessed! The Lord has totally hooked you up today with a kinsman, like, seriously awesome. He's gonna be, like, famous in Israel and all. Woohoo! 🙌 15. He's gonna be like your life-saver, the one who takes care of you in your old age. Your daughter-in-law, who loves you even more than seven sons could, has given birth to him. He's gonna be the one who nourishes you when you're old and gray. 16. So Naomi picked up the baby and cradled them against her chest, taking care of them like a loving aunt. 17. So, like, all the ladies in the hood were like, 'OMG, Naomi had a baby boy!' and they named him Obed. He's, like, the OG father of Jesse, who's, like, the OG father of David. 18. So like, here's the story of Pharez and his descendants: Pharez had a son named Hezron, 19. And Hezron had a kid named Ram, who later had a son named Amminadab, 20. And Amminadab had a son named Nahshon, and Nahshon had a son named Salmon, {Salmon: or, Salmah} 21. And Salmon had a kid named Boaz, and Boaz had a kid named Obed, 22. And Obed had a kid named Jesse, and Jesse had a kid named David. \n",
      "KJV: Ruth 41. Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down. 2. And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down. 3. And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which {was} our brother Elimelech's: 4. And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy {it} before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem {it}, redeem {it}: but if thou wilt not redeem {it, then} tell me, that I may know: for {there is} none to redeem {it} beside thee; and I {am} after thee. And he said, I will redeem {it}. {I thought...: Heb. I said, I will reveal in thine ear} 5. Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy {it} also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance. 6. And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem {it} for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem {it}. 7. Now this {was the manner} in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave {it} to his neighbour: and this {was} a testimony in Israel. 8. Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy {it} for thee. So he drew off his shoe. 9. And Boaz said unto the elders, and {unto} all the people, Ye {are} witnesses this day, that I have bought all that {was} Elimelech's, and all that {was} Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi. 10. Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye {are} witnesses this day. 11. And all the people that {were} in the gate, and the elders, said, {We are} witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem: {do thou...: or, get thee riches, or, power} {be famous: Heb. proclaim thy name} 12. And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman. 13. So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son. 14. And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed {be} the LORD, which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel. {left...: Heb. caused to cease unto thee} {kinsman: or, redeemer} 15. And he shall be unto thee a restorer of {thy} life, and a nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath born him. {a nourisher of: Heb. to nourish} {thine...: Heb. thy gray hairs} 16. And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it. 17. And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he {is} the father of Jesse, the father of David. 18. Now these {are} the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron, 19. And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 20. And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, {Salmon: or, Salmah} 21. And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, 22. And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 11. So, there was this dude from Ramathaimzophim, up on mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah. He was the son of Jeroham, who was the son of Elihu, who was the son of Tohu, who was the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite. 2. So this guy had two wifey material girls - one named Hannah and the other named Peninnah. Turns out, Peninnah was popping out kids left and right, but poor Hannah couldn't have any children. 3. So this guy would bounce from his city every year to worship and make offerings to the big man upstairs, the LORD of hosts, in Shiloh. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, who were the LORD's priests, were also there. (Yearly means from year to year, in case you were wondering!) 4. And when Elkanah was about to offer, he shared some of the goodies with Peninnah, his wifey, and all her kiddos: 5. But Hannah got an extra special blessing because she had earned it—God really loved her! But unfortunately, God closed up her womb and she couldn't have any kids. {extra special: or, twice as much} 6. And the other girl kept on teasing her and making her upset, just to bother her, because God had not allowed her to have children. 7. And every year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, her rival would get under her skin so much that she would start crying and refuse to eat. 8. Elkanah, Hannah's husband, asked her, 'Why are you crying and not eating? Why is your heart heavy? Aren't I worth more to you than ten sons?' 9. So Hannah got up after they had finished eating in Shiloh, and after they had clinked their drinks. Now Eli the priest was chilling on a seat next to a post in the LORD's temple. 10. And she was feeling really down and prayed to the LORD with all her heart, crying a lot. 11. And she made a promise, saying, O powerful God, if you really pay attention to the difficult situation I'm in, and remember me, and don't forget about me, but grant me a baby boy, then I'll dedicate him to you for his entire life, and he won't cut his hair. 12. And it happened, as she kept on praying before the LORD, that Eli noticed her speaking fervently. {continued...: Heb. kept multiplying her prayers} 13. So Hannah, like, she was praying in her head - her lips were moving but no sound came out. So Eli thought she was wasted or something. 14. Eli was like, 'Yo, how much longer you gonna keep sippin' on that booze? Put that wine down already.' 15. Hannah replied, like, nah, my dude, I'm, like, totally down in the dumps. I haven't even had a sip of wine or any other strong drink. Instead, I've been pouring out my heart to the LORD. It's been tough, you know? 16. Don't label me, your girl, as some child of evil vibes. 'Cause everything I've been expressing so far is just a overflow of my ventings and sadness, yeah. {complaint: or, deep thoughts} 17. And then Eli was like, 'You good, bro? May the God of Israel totally hook you up with that thing you asked for.' 18. She was like, 'Yo, please be cool with me and show me some love.' After that, she bounced, had a good meal, and suddenly she wasn't feeling down anymore. 19. The next morning, they woke up early and gave reverence to the LORD, then went back to their crib in Ramah. Elkanah and Hannah, his wifey, slayed the intimacy game, and the LORD had their back and showed Hannah some love. 20. So, after some time, when Hannah got pregnant, she gave birth to a son and named him Samuel. She said, 'I asked the Lord for him.' 21. So Elkanah and his whole fam decided to head up to the LORD's place and offer the yearly sacrifice, like they promised. 22. But Hannah didn't go up; she told her husband, 'I'm not gonna go up until the baby is weaned, and then I'll bring him to appear before the LORD and stay there forever.' 23. Elkanah, her hubby, was like, 'Yo, do whatever you think is right. Just chill until you stop breastfeeding him. But for real, may the Lord fulfill what He promised.' So the woman stayed put and breastfed her son until he was weaned. 24. After she was done breastfeeding him, she brought him along with three big dudes, a ton of flour, a bottle of wine, and took him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh. And this kid was still just a youngin'. 25. So they had a cow, and took the kid to Eli. 26. And she was like, OMG my dude, I swear on your life, my dude, I'm the girl who was right here with you, totally praying to the LORD. 27. I totally prayed for this kid, and the LORD hooked me up with exactly what I asked for, no cap: 28. So, basically, I've given him to God, like loaning him out. As long as he's alive, he'll be dedicated to God. And he worshipped God there. {loaned him: or, gave him back, after getting him through prayer} {he shall...: or, the one I got through prayer shall be given back} \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 11. Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name {was} Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite: 2. And he had two wives; the name of the one {was} Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 3. And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, {were} there. {yearly: Heb. from year to year} 4. And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: 5. But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb. {worthy: or, double} 6. And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb. {provoked: Heb. angered} 7. And {as} he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat. {when...: or, from the time that she, etc: Heb. from her going up} 8. Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? {am} not I better to thee than ten sons? 9. So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD. 10. And she {was} in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore. {in...: Heb. bitter of soul} 11. And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. {a man...: Heb. seed of men} 12. And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. {continued...: Heb. multiplied to pray} 13. Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. 14. And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. 15. And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I {am} a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. {of a sorrowful...: Heb. hard of spirit} 16. Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. {complaint: or, meditation} 17. Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant {thee} thy petition that thou hast asked of him. 18. And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more {sad}. 19. And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her. 20. Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, {saying}, Because I have asked him of the LORD. {when...: Heb. in revolution of days} {Samuel: that is, Asked of God} 21. And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. 22. But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, {I will not go up} until the child be weaned, and {then} I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever. 23. And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him. 24. And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child {was} young. 25. And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. 26. And she said, Oh my lord, {as} thy soul liveth, my lord, I {am} the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. 27. For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: 28. Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there. {lent him: or, returned him, whom I have obtained by petition} {he shall...: or, he whom I have obtained by petition shall be returned} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 21. So Hannah prayed and she was like, 'OMG, my heart is so happy because of the LORD! Like, I feel so powerful and confident because of Him. I can't even! My words are full of victory and I totally slay my enemies, because I'm all about celebrating Your saving grace.' 2. No one can match the holiness of the LORD, 'cause there's nobody else like Him. No one's as solid and awesome as our God. 3. Don't talk so arrogantly anymore, seriously. Like, no need to be all full of yourself, okay? 'Cause the LORD is, like, super knowledgeable and everything we do gets weighed by Him, you know? So, let's keep it humble, fam. #Blessed 4. The super strong warriors' bows got wrecked, and the clumsy ones are now rockin' some serious strength. 5. Those who were well-fed have started working for food, and those who were hungry have stopped starving. As a result, the infertile woman has miraculously given birth to seven children, while the woman with many kids has become weak and tired. 6. God can take lives and restore them; He can humble and exalt. 7. God can make someone broke or ballin', He can humble ya or raise ya up. 8. He brings the underprivileged out of their struggles, lift them from the lowest points, to elevate them among the influential, and grant them a fulfilling legacy. The foundation of the world belongs to the LORD, as He establishes it upon His authority. 9. He's got his saints' backs, and the wicked will be hella quiet in the dark; 'cause nobody can win by flexing alone. 10. The haters of the LORD are gonna get wrecked; He's gonna let loose some heavenly thunder on them: The LORD is gonna judge the whole earth, and give his king mad strength, and raise up the power of his chosen one. 11. So Elkanah went home to Ramah. And the kid started serving the LORD under Priest Eli. 12. So, like, Eli's sons were totally sons of Belial, you know? They had no clue about the LORD. 13. So, like, the priests had this thing going on with the people where, when a dude wanted to offer a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come over while the meat was cooking, holding this three-pronged meat hook, you know? 14. And he like, put it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; and whatever the cool fleshhook pulled out, the priest straight up snagged it for himself. So they totally did that in Shiloh for all the Israelites who rolled up there. 15. Yo, before they burned that fat, the priest's servant pulled up and said to the guy sacrificing, 'Yo, hook it up with some meat to roast for the priest. He ain't tryna eat no cooked meat, fam, he wants it raw.' 16. And if someone tells him, 'Don't forget to roast the fat right away and take as much as you want,' he would reply, 'Actually, I want it now. And if you don't give it to me, I'll take it forcefully.' 17. Yo, the young dudes were hella sinning in front of the LORD, 'cause people straight up despised the offerings made to the LORD. 18. Samuel was like, straight up serving the LORD, and get this—he was just a kid, rockin' a cool linen ephod! 19. And like, his mom would totally make him this cool little outfit, and she'd bring it to him every year when they all went up together for the big sacrifice thing. 20. Eli gave his blessings to Elkanah and his wife, saying, may the LORD grant you a child from this woman, just like she requested. Then they went back to their crib. 21. So, like, God totally came through for Hannah and she got preggers and had three sons and two daughters. And this kid Samuel, he grew up all holy and stuff right in front of God's eyes. 22. So, like, Eli was, like, super old and he totally knew everything his sons were doing to all the people of Israel. And, uh, they were, like, hooking up with the women who were hanging out by the entrance of the meeting place. You know, that place where everyone gathered and stuff. Uh, it says 'assembled by troops' in the original Hebrew, whatever that means. 23. He was like, 'Why are you doing all this messed up stuff? I'm hearing about all your shady business from everyone.' 24. Nah, bros, not gonna lie, I'm getting some seriously bad vibes here. Word on the street is that you're making the LORD's crew go off track. Like, it's not cool, you feel me? 25. If someone wrongs another person, the judge will make a ruling, but if someone disrespects the LORD, who can plead their case? Even so, they ignored their father's advice because the LORD intended to punish them. 26. And Samuel, the kid, kept on leveling up and he was well-liked by both the LORD and everyone around him. 27. So, this guy who's totally connected with God, came up to Eli and straight up said, 'Listen up, bro. The Almighty is telling you, like did He not make it crystal clear back in the day to your family back in Egypt, when they were chilling in Pharaoh's crib? 28. Like, did I specifically pick him from, like, all the tribes of Israel to be my priest and do all these lit things like offering sacrifices on my altar, burning incense, and rocking that ephod in front of me? And didn't I also give the offerings the Israelites brought to the house of your dad? 29. Why are you dissing my sacrifice and offering that I specifically told you to do in my house? And why are you honoring your sons more than me, trying to get all the best stuff from the offerings of my people, Israel? 30. So, like, the LORD God of Israel is saying, I totally said that your family, including your dad's fam, were gonna be all righteous and stuff forever. But now the LORD is like, uh-uh, not happening. 'Cause those who show respect for me will be respected, but those who diss me will be totally put down. 31. Yo, listen up! The future's lookin' rough for ya - I'm about to take away your arm and the arms of everyone in your family, leavin' no old dudes left in your crib. 32. And you're gonna have some serious trouble in your crib, with all the blessings that God's gonna give Israel. Plus, there won't be any OGs chillin' in your house for good. 33. And anyone from your family who remains at my altar will cause you distress and sadness. Moreover, your descendants will die young, before their time. 34. Yo, listen up! Here's a sign for you, specifically for your boys Hophni and Phinehas. On the same day, they're gonna kick the bucket - both of 'em. 35. And I'm gonna bring up this really loyal priest, who's gonna do everything that I have in mind and in my heart. I'm gonna make sure he has a solid foundation, and he'll serve my chosen one forever. 36. And it will happen that whoever is still in your house will come and bow down to him, asking for a bit of cash and a bite to eat, saying, please let me join the priests' squad so I can grab a snack. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 21. And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation. 2. {There is} none holy as the LORD: for {there is} none beside thee: neither {is there} any rock like our God. 3. Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let {not} arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD {is} a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. {arrogancy: Heb. hard} 4. The bows of the mighty men {are} broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength. 5. {They that were} full have hired out themselves for bread; and {they that were} hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble. 6. The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up. 7. The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up. 8. He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, {and} lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set {them} among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth {are} the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them. 9. He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail. 10. The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed. 11. And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest. 12. Now the sons of Eli {were} sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD. 13. And the priests' custom with the people {was, that}, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand; 14. And he struck {it} into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither. 15. Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw. 16. And {if} any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and {then} take {as much} as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, {Nay}; but thou shalt give {it me} now: and if not, I will take {it} by force. {presently: Heb. as on the day} 17. Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD. 18. But Samuel ministered before the LORD, {being} a child, girded with a linen ephod. 19. Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought {it} to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 20. And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home. {loan...: or, petition which she asked, etc} 21. And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD. 22. Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. {assembled: Heb. assembled by troops} 23. And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people. {of your...: or, evil words of you} 24. Nay, my sons; for {it is} no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD'S people to transgress. {transgress: or, cry out} 25. If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them. 26. And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men. 27. And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house? 28. And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel {to be} my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel? 29. Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded {in my} habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people? 30. Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed {that} thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. 31. Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house. 32. And thou shalt see an enemy {in my} habitation, in all {the wealth} which {God} shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever. {an enemy...: or, the affliction of the tabernacle, for all the wealth which God would have given Israel} 33. And the man of thine, {whom} I shall not cut off from mine altar, {shall be} to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age. {in the flower...: Heb. men} 34. And this {shall be} a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them. 35. And I will raise me up a faithful priest, {that} shall do according to {that} which {is} in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever. 36. And it shall come to pass, {that} every one that is left in thine house shall come {and} crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of bread. {Put: Heb. Join} {one of...: or, somewhat about the priesthood} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 31. So like, Samuel was totally serving the LORD under Eli. And let me tell you, the word of the LORD was like super valuable back then, 'cause there weren't any visions happening. 2. So, like, this happened when Eli was lying down in his spot and his vision started getting blurry, like, he couldn't see anything anymore. 3. And before the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was getting some rest; 4. So, like, God totally called out to Samuel and he was like, 'Yo, here I am, what's up?' 5. So he went up to Eli and was like, 'Yo, you called me?' And Eli was like, 'Nah bro, I didn't call you. Go back to bed.' And the dude went back and crashed. 6. Yo, the LORD hit up Samuel once again. So Samuel got up and went to Eli, saying, 'Here I am, you called me?' But Eli was like, 'Nah, my dude, I didn't call you. Go back to bed.' 7. At that time, Samuel didn't actually know God yet, and God hadn't revealed His message to him either. (Just so you know, this all happened before Samuel had a personal relationship with God or received His divine instructions.) 8. Then, like, the LORD called Samuel again, you know, for the third time, and Samuel was all like, 'Okay, okay, I'm coming!' So he got up and went to Eli, and was like, 'Yo, you called me?' And Eli realized that it was actually the LORD who had called the kid. 9. So Eli was like yo, Samuel, go chillax and lay down. If you hear someone calling you, say 'What's up, LORD? I'm all ears.' So Samuel did as Eli said and went to crash in his spot. 10. Then God showed up and was like, 'Samuel, Samuel!' And Samuel was like, 'Yo, what's up? I'm listening, talk to me.' 11. So, like, God was all like, 'Yo, Samuel! Check it out, I'm about to make something happen in Israel that'll totally blow everyone's mind, like their ears will be ringing and stuff.' 12. On that day, I'm gonna do everything I said I would against Eli and his family. Once I start, I won't stop until it's finished. It's gonna be epic, fam! #BeginningAndEnding 13. So I'm like, telling him straight up that I'm gonna judge his whole fam forever, 'cause they're totally doing messed up stuff that they know is wrong. His sons are acting all disgusting and he's not even doing anything about it, not even giving them a disappointed look or anything. 14. So, I've, like, totally made this oath to Eli's family, that, like, their wickedness can't just be wiped away with sacrifices or offerings, you know? Like, it's gonna stick with them forever. 15. So Samuel crashed at the crib all night, then woke up in the morning and unlocked the doors to God's house. But he was low-key stressed about sharing the vision with Eli. 16. So Eli called out to Samuel and was like, 'Yo, Samuel, my dude.' And Samuel was all like, 'What's up? I'm right here.' 17. And he was like, dude, what did the LORD tell you? Seriously, don't keep it a secret from me, bro. I swear, if you hide anything from me, may God totally punish you and stuff. And I mean it, whatever He said to you, spill the tea. Like, seriously: don't hold anything back, ya know? {more also: Hebrew for, like, 'extra'} {thing: or, word} 18. Samuel spilled all the tea, didn't hold back a thing. He was like, 'Yo, it's all God's plan, let Him do what He thinks is best.' 19. Samuel was like, totally thriving, and God was like, always by his side, making sure none of his words went unnoticed. 20. And, like, everyone in Israel, from like Dan to Beersheba, totally knew that Samuel was, like, confirmed as a prophet of the LORD. #legit #faithful 21. So, the LORD showed up again in Shiloh, 'cause that's where the LORD decided to reveal himself to Samuel. And guess how? Yeah, it was through the word of the LORD. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 31. And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; {there was} no open vision. 2. And it came to pass at that time, when Eli {was} laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, {that} he could not see; 3. And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God {was}, and Samuel was laid down {to sleep}; 4. That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here {am} I. 5. And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down. 6. And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again. 7. Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. {Now...: or, Thus did Samuel before he knew the LORD, and before the word of the LORD was revealed unto him} 8. And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child. 9. Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place. 10. And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth. 11. And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle. 12. In that day I will perform against Eli all {things} which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. {when...: Heb. beginning and ending} 13. For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. {For I...: or, And I will tell him} {vile: or, accursed} {restrained...: Heb. frowned not upon them} 14. And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever. 15. And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision. 16. Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here {am} I. 17. And he said, What {is} the thing that {the LORD} hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide {it} not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide {any} thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. {more also: Heb. so add} {thing: or, word} 18. And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It {is} the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good. {every...: Heb. all the things, or, words} 19. And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground. 20. And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel {was} established {to be} a prophet of the LORD. {established: or, faithful} 21. And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 41. So, like, Samuel's message spread to all of Israel. And then, Israel decided to face off against the Philistines in, like, a fierce battle. They set up camp near Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped out in Aphek. It all went down, you know? 2. So, like, the Philistines and Israel were totally facing off, and when they finally clashed, Israel got totally wrecked by the Philistines. They managed to take out about four thousand dudes in the field. Such a bummer, man! 3. So, like, when the people finally reached the camp, the older peeps of Israel were like, 'Why did the LORD let us get beat by the Philistines today? Maybe we should bring the LORD's ark of the covenant from Shiloh, and like, when it's with us, it might rescue us from our enemies. {fetch: By the way, 'fetch' means 'take unto us'} 4. So the people were like, 'Yo, let's go to Shiloh and bring the lit AF ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, you know, the one chillin' between them cherubims?' And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were straight up there with the ark of the covenant of God. 5. And when the LORD's sacred ark rolled into the camp, all of Israel let out a massive shout that echoed through the earth. 6. And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they were like, 'Yo, what's up with this loud AF noise in the Hebrews' camp?' And they figured out that the ark of the LORD had arrived in the camp. 7. The Philistines were totally shook, 'cause they were like, dude, God just rolled up in our camp. And they were like, OMG, we're so screwed! This has never happened before, like seriously. 8. OMG, we're so screwed! Who's gonna save us from these mega powerful Gods? Like, these are the Gods who totally wrecked the Egyptians with all those insane plagues in the desert! 9. Yo, Philistines, show some strength and dignity. Don't let yourselves be slaves to the Hebrews like they were to you. Step up, be courageous, and bring on the fight. Let's show some true manliness here! 10. So like, the Philistines were all up in a fight with Israel, and Israel got totally wrecked, man. They ran for their lives, each one heading back to their own tent. It was a total bloodbath, like thirty thousand warriors from Israel bit the dust, dude. 11. So, like, the sacred ark of God got snatched, and Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, got wrecked. Yeah, they straight-up died. #NoMercy 12. So this guy from the Benjamin squad straight up booked it out of there and showed up in Shiloh the same day, all disheveled with his ripped clothes and dirt all over his head. 13. And when he arrived, like, Eli was chilling on a seat by the side of the road, keeping an eye out, 'cause he was mad worried about the ark of God. So when the guy came into the city and spilled the tea, everyone in the city straight up freaked out. 14. And when Eli heard all that noise and commotion, he was like, 'Yo, what's up with this chaos?' And this guy rushed in and spilled the tea to Eli. 15. So Eli was, like, almost a hundred years old and his eyesight was, like, really bad. He couldn't see anything. 16. The guy told Eli, I'm the dude who bolted from the army today. And Eli asked, What happened, my dude? What's the deal? 17. Yo, the messenger responded like, 'Dude, Israel totally got wrecked by the Philistines! It was a serious bloodbath out there. Oh, and by the way, your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas? Yeah, they're gone. And guess what? The ark of God got snatched too.' 18. So, this one time, when he was talking about the ark of God, he accidentally fell off his seat, backwards, right by the gate. His neck snapped and he died because, well, he was old and pretty hefty. By the way, he had been the judge of Israel for a solid forty years. 19. And Phinehas' wife, who was gonna have a baby soon, heard the news that the ark of God was captured and that her father-in-law and husband had passed away. She got all emotional and started having contractions, 'cause the pain hit her hard. 20. And when she was about to pass away, the women standing by her said, 'Don't be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.' But she did not respond, nor did she pay any attention to it. 21. And she gave the child the name Ichabod, saying, 'The vibes have left Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband. {Ichabod: which means, Where is the glow-up? or, There is no glow-up}' 22. Yo, she was like, 'OMG, the swag is totally gone from Israel! The legit ark of God got snatched away!' \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 41. And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek. {came: or, came to pass: Heb. was} 2. And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel: and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men. {they joined...: Heb. the battle was spread} {army: Heb. array} 3. And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies. {fetch: Heb. take unto us} 4. So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth {between} the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, {were} there with the ark of the covenant of God. 5. And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again. 6. And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What {meaneth} the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD was come into the camp. 7. And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not been such a thing heretofore. {heretofore: Heb. yesterday, or, the third day} 8. Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these {are} the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness. 9. Be strong, and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you: quit yourselves like men, and fight. {quit...: Heb. be men} 10. And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. 11. And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain. {were slain: Heb. died} 12. And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head. 13. And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told {it}, all the city cried out. 14. And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What {meaneth} the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli. 15. Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim, that he could not see. {were dim: Heb. stood} 16. And the man said unto Eli, I {am} he that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there done, my son? {is...: Heb. is the thing} 17. And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. 18. And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years. 19. And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, {near} to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came upon her. {be delivered: or, cry out} {came: Heb. were turned} 20. And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she answered not, neither did she regard {it}. {neither...: Heb. set not her heart} 21. And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband. {Ichabod: that is, Where is the glory? or, There is no glory} 22. And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is taken. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 51. So, like, the Philistines, they totally grabbed the ark of God and, like, transferred it all the way from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 2. So like, when the Philistines grabbed the sacred box of God, they totally brought it into the house of Dagon and just plopped it down next to Dagon. 3. So, like, the next morning, when the people of Ashdod woke up, guess what? Dagon totally faceplanted on the ground in front of the LORD's ark. They had to pick up Dagon and put him back in his spot. 4. And like, the next morning when they woke up, they saw that Dagon had totally fallen flat on his face in front of the LORD's ark. His head and hands were completely cut off on the threshold, man. Only a tiny stump of Dagon was left. You know, like, the fishy part. 5. So like, none of those priests that worship Dagon, or anyone who enters Dagon's crib in Ashdod, dare to step on Dagon's front porch up until now. 6. But God's power hit hard against the people of Ashdod, and he brought destruction upon them. They were struck with a severe affliction called emerods, affecting not only Ashdod, but the surrounding areas as well. 7. So, when the dudes from Ashdod peeped that it went like that, they were like, 'No way can we keep this Israel God's ark with us. It's totally wrecking us and our god Dagon.' 8. So they hit up all the top Philistine bosses and were like, 'Yo, what should we do with this ark of the God of Israel?' And the bosses were like, 'Just take that God of Israel's ark over to Gath and move it around there.' So, that's exactly what they did, they moved that ark of the God of Israel over there. 9. So, like, after they carried it around, the LORD was totally not happy with the city and caused some serious destruction. He totally wrecked the dudes in the city, no matter if they were young or old, and they ended up with some unpleasant physical issues. 10. So they sent the God's ark to Ekron. And when the God's ark arrived in Ekron, the people there freaked out, saying, 'OMG, they brought the God of Israel's ark here to kill us and our peeps. Like seriously, they wanna slay me and my squad!' 11. So they rounded up all the big shots of the Philistines and were like, 'Yo, let's bounce the ark of the God of Israel back to where it came from before it wrecks us and our peeps. The city is getting wrecked left and right - no doubt, the hand of God is coming down hard here.' 12. And those who didn't die were struck with a terrible disease, and the whole city was in agony and shocked. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 51. And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod. 2. When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. 3. And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon {was} fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. 4. And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon {was} fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands {were} cut off upon the threshold; only {the stump of} Dagon was left to him. {the stump...: or, the fishy part} 5. Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day. 6. But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, {even} Ashdod and the coasts thereof. 7. And when the men of Ashdod saw that {it was} so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god. 8. They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about {thither}. 9. And it was {so}, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts. 10. Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people. {us, to...: Heb. me to slay me and my} 11. So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there. {us not...: Heb. me not, and my} 12. And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 61. So, like, the Lord's ark stayed with the Philistines for, like, a solid seven months. 2. So the Philistines were like, 'Yo, we need some priests and diviners to help us out here. What should we do with this ark of the LORD? Tell us how to send it back to where it belongs.' 3. And they were like, listen up, if you're gonna ditch the ark of the God of Israel, don't just send it away with nothing. You better make sure to send a trespass offering back with it. Only then will you be healed and understand why God's like not chillin' with you anymore. 4. So they were like, 'What should we give as a way to make up for our wrongs?' And they were like, 'Let's give five gold statues of tumors and five gold statues of mice, to represent the number of Philistine rulers. That's because all of you and your rulers have been affected by the same plague.' 5. So, like, you should create, uh, pictures or something of your diseases and the rodents that are causin' trouble in your land. And, you know, give props to the God of Israel. Maybe then He'll back off with His punishment and take it easy on you, your gods, and your land. 6. So, why are you being so stubborn, like the Egyptians and Pharaoh who were also stubborn? Didn't they finally let the people go after seeing all the amazing things that happened? And then the people left? 7. So, like, go ahead and get a fresh new cart and grab two cows that haven't been used for any work, and tie those cows to the cart. After that, bring their baby cows back to your place. 8. Yo, grab the LORD's ark and put it on the cart. Don't forget to place the gold jewels, like the ones you're returning for the trespass offering, in a box next to it. Then, send it off on its way. 9. So, like, if that thing goes in the direction of his own place, towards Bethshemesh, then it's like he's totally responsible for bringing us this huge disaster. But if it doesn't, then we'll know for sure that it wasn't him who attacked us. It was just some random coincidence that messed us up. Like, seriously, he had nothing to do with it. 10. So the guys did it; they grabbed two lit cows, tied them to the cart, and left their cute calves at home:  11. So they put the LORD's ark on the cart, along with the chest filled with gold mice and their statues of tumors. 12. And the cows went straight towards Bethshemesh, walking along the road, mooing as they went, without turning to the right or left. The leaders of the Philistines followed them all the way to the border of Bethshemesh. 13. So, the people of Bethshemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley, you know? And suddenly, they looked up and spotted the ark, and man, they were stoked to see that thing! 14. So, like, the cart rolled up into Joshua's field in Bethshemesh and just stopped, right next to this huge stone. And then they, like, broke apart the wood from the cart and made a burnt offering out of the cows for the LORD. 15. Then the Levites brought down the ark of the LORD, along with the container that had all the awesome gold stuff in it, and placed them on this massive rock. And the people of Bethshemesh made burnt offerings and sacrifice to the LORD on that very day. 16. And when the five big shots of the Philistines peeped {that}, they bounced back to Ekron ASAP. 17. And yo, these are the shiny lumps that the Philistines brought back as an offering to apologize to the LORD; one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Askelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron. 18. And there were golden mice, like, a bunch of them for all the cities of the Philistines under the control of the five bosses. They had these mice in their fancy cities and also in the smaller towns, all the way up to this huge rock called Abel where they left the ark of the LORD. That rock is still there in Joshua's field today, in the town of Bethshemite. It's pretty gnarly, right?! 19. And like, God totally wrecked the guys from Bethshemesh 'cause they peeked into the LORD's ark. He smacked down like fifty thousand and seventy dudes, and everyone was bummed 'cause God smoked a bunch of people in a major beatdown. 20. The dudes from Bethshemesh were like, yo who can even handle being in the presence of this all-powerful LORD God? Like, who can measure up to Him and meet Him face-to-face? 21. So these people hit up the folks in Kirjathjearim and were like, 'Yo, the Philistines brought back the LORD's ark. Come through and bring it over here.' \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 61. And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months. 2. And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place. 3. And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you. 4. Then said they, What {shall be} the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and five golden mice, {according to} the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague {was} on you all, and on your lords. {you: Heb. them} 5. Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land. 6. Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed? {wonderfully: or, reproachfully} {the people: Heb. them} 7. Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them: 8. And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which ye return him {for} a trespass offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away, that it may go. 9. And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, {then} he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that {it is} not his hand {that} smote us: it {was} a chance {that} happened to us. {he: or, it} 10. And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home: 11. And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods. 12. And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, {and} went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not aside {to} the right hand or {to} the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh. 13. And {they of} Bethshemesh {were} reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see {it}. 14. And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stood there, where {there was} a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the LORD. 15. And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that {was} with it, wherein the jewels of gold {were}, and put {them} on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD. 16. And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen {it}, they returned to Ekron the same day. 17. And these {are} the golden emerods which the Philistines returned {for} a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one; 18. And the golden mice, {according to} the number of all the cities of the Philistines {belonging} to the five lords, {both} of fenced cities, and of country villages, even unto the great {stone of} Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: {which stone remaineth} unto this day in the field of Joshua, the Bethshemite. {great...: or, great stone} 19. And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten {many} of the people with a great slaughter. 20. And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us? 21. And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come ye down, {and} fetch it up to you. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 71. So, like, the dudes from Kirjathjearim showed up, totally grabbed the ark of the LORD, and took it to Abinadab's crib up on the hill. They totally set apart Eleazar, his son, to be in charge of looking after the ark of the LORD. 2. So, the ark was chillin' in Kirjathjearim for a long time, like, twenty years, and all the people of Israel were feeling super bummed out, like, really missing the LORD. 3. So Samuel was talking to all the peeps in Israel, and he was like, yo, if you want to get right with the LORD, you gotta get rid of those weird gods and idols you're into, and focus your hearts on God, and like, only serve Him. If you do that, He'll totally save you from the Philistines, no joke. 4. So the Israelites totally ditched Baalim and Ashtaroth, and started vibing with the LORD only. 5. So Samuel was like, yo, call all of Israel to Mizpeh, and I'll hit up the LORD with my prayers for you, fam. 6. So they all met up in Mizpeh, grabbed some water, and poured it out as an offering to the LORD. They decided to fast that day and admitted, 'We messed up big time by disobeying the LORD.' And Samuel took charge of leading and guiding the people of Israel in Mizpeh. 7. So, like, when the Philistines found out that the Israelites were all meeting up at Mizpeh, the Philistine bosses rolled up on Israel. And, bro, when the Israelites heard about it, they got scared of the Philistines and stuff. 8. The Israelites were like, yo Samuel, keep praying to the LORD our God for us, ask Him to rescue us from those Philistines. Don't stop praying 'cause we need Him to come through. #TeamIsrael 9. So Samuel grabbed a cute little lamb and gave it as a sacrifice to the Lord. He prayed to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and guess what? The Lord totally listened to him! 10. So, like, Samuel was doing his whole burnt offering thing, right? And then, outta nowhere, the Philistines were all like, 'Yo, let's battle Israel!' But then, the LORD, like, totally unleashed this mega thunderstorm on the Philistines that really messed them up. They totally got wrecked and were defeated by Israel. 11. So, like, the dudes from Israel left Mizpeh and totally chased after the Philistines and like, totally destroyed them, until they were all the way under Bethcar. 12. So Samuel grabbed a rock and placed it between Mizpeh and Shen, and named it Ebenezer, saying, 'Until now, God has been there for us.' 13. So, like, the Philistines were totally defeated and they didn't bother the Israelites anymore: and you know what? God was totally against the Philistines for the whole time Samuel was around. 14. Yo, listen up! So, the cities that the Philistines had taken from Israel, they were totally given back to Israel. Like, from Ekron all the way to Gath - Israel got 'em back! And guess what? Israel totally kicked the Philistines' hands off their coastal areas. Boom! So, after all that, Israel and the Amorites were cool and there was mad peace between them. No drama, y'all! 15. And Samuel was the OG judge of Israel his whole life. 16. And he traveled from year to year, going around to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpeh, where he served as a judge over Israel in all those towns. {circuited: like, he totally traveled through} 17. And he went back to Ramah, cuz that's where his crib was, and that's where he was the boss of Israel, and that's where he set up an altar for the LORD. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 71. And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD. 2. And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD. 3. And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, {then} put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines. 4. Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only. 5. And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the LORD. 6. And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured {it} out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh. 7. And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard {it}, they were afraid of the Philistines. 8. And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines. {Cease...: Heb. Be not silent from us from crying} 9. And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered {it for} a burnt offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him. {heard: or, answered} 10. And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel. 11. And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until {they came} under Bethcar. 12. Then Samuel took a stone, and set {it} between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us. {Ebenezer: that is, The stone of help} 13. So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. 14. And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites. 15. And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 16. And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places. {in circuit: Heb. and he circuited} 17. And his return {was} to Ramah; for there {was} his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 81. So, like, Samuel was getting up there in age, right? And he decided to appoint his sons as judges to rule over all of Israel, ya know? 2. So this dude named his first kid Joel, and his second one Abiah. And get this, they were both like, big shots as judges in Beersheba. 3. But his sons didn't follow his example, they got caught up in the pursuit of money, accepting bribes, and distorting justice. 4. So all the OGs of Israel gathered up and pulled up to Samuel in Ramah. 5. And they were like, dude, listen up, you're like ancient and your kids are not following in your path. So, we want you to hook us up with a king, just like all the other cool countries have, to lead and judge us. 6. But Samuel was not cool with it when they were like, 'We want a king to rule over us.' So Samuel hit up the Lord with a prayer. 7. So, the LORD was like, 'Yo, Samuel, listen up and pay attention to what the people are saying to you. It's not about you though, they're actually rejecting me and refusing to let me be their ruler.' 8. Like, for real, since the day I rescued them from Egypt, they've been doing all kinds of stuff that straight up goes against me. They've totally ditched me and started worshiping these other gods, and they're totally gonna do the same thing to you, dude. 9. So listen up to what they're saying, but make sure you firmly express your thoughts to them and explain how the king will rule over them. 10. So, Samuel straight up spilled all the words of the LORD to the people who were like asking him for a king, you know? 11. And he was like, yo, this is how the king's gonna roll when he's in charge: He's gonna scoop up your boys and put 'em on his team, ridin' in his dope chariots and bein' his horsemen. And there's even gonna be some homies runnin' ahead of his chariots. So that's how it's gonna go down, fam. 12. Then he'll choose leaders for thousands and leaders for fifties. They'll be in charge of farming his land, harvesting his crops, and constructing weapons and chariots. 13. And he's gonna hire your daughters as badass pastry chefs, master chefs, and expert bakers. 14. And he'll totally swipe your fields, vineyards, and oliveyards, picking out the juiciest ones, and handing them over to his crew. 15. And he's gonna take like 10% of all your crops and wine and give it to his squad, and like his crew, you know? 💸✨ 16. And he'll be like, taking all your servants, even, like, the coolest ones and the younger guys, and even your donkeys, and making them do his stuff. 17. He's gonna take a cut of your sheep - like, a solid tenth. And get this, you'll totally be his servants, like, doing his bidding and all. Crazy, right? 18. And you're gonna be like, ugh, totally freaking out that day because of the king you all picked for yourselves, and seriously, God's not gonna listen to you on that day, just saying. 19. But the people were like, nah, not gonna listen to Samuel. They were all like, we want a king to rule over us, y'know? 20. Bruh, let's just be like everybody else, ya know? We need a king to lead us, fight our battles, and be our hype man, always leading the charge on the front lines. 21. So Samuel heard everything the people were saying and then told the Lord all about it. 22. Yo, Samuel, listen up! The Lord wants you to pay attention to what the peeps are saying and make 'em a king. So Samuel tells the squad from Israel to head back to their cities, yo! \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 81. And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel. 2. Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: {they were} judges in Beersheba. 3. And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. 4. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, 5. And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. 6. But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. {displeased: Heb. was evil in the eyes of} 7. And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. 8. According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. 9. Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. {hearken...: or, obey} {howbeit...: or, notwithstanding when thou hast solemnly protested against them then thou shalt} 10. And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. 11. And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint {them} for himself, for his chariots, and {to be} his horsemen; and {some} shall run before his chariots. 12. And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and {will set them} to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. 13. And he will take your daughters {to be} confectionaries, and {to be} cooks, and {to be} bakers. 14. And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, {even} the best {of them}, and give {them} to his servants. 15. And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. {officers: Heb. eunuchs} 16. And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put {them} to his work. 17. He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. 18. And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day. 19. Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; 20. That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. 21. And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD. 22. And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 91. So, like, there was this dude from the tribe of Benjamin whose name was Kish. He was the son of Abiel, who was the son of Zeror, who was the son of Bechorath, who was the son of Aphiah. This Kish guy was, like, a total powerhouse, man. He had mad skills and was really influential, ya know? 2. So this guy named Saul was really cool and good-looking. Like, seriously, there was no one better-looking than him among the people of Israel. He stood head and shoulders above everyone else! 3. So, like, Kish, Saul's dad, lost his donkeys. And Kish was all like, 'Yo, Saul, grab one of our servants and, like, go find those donkeys.' 4. So he went through mount Ephraim, and then through the land of Shalisha, but they couldn't find them. Then they went through the land of Shalim, and still couldn't find them. And he went through the land of the Benjamites, but they couldn't find them either. 5. So, like, once they arrived in Zuph, Saul was all like, hey servant dude, let's go back home. I mean, if we don't, my dad might stop worrying about the donkeys and start getting concerned about us. 6. Yo, listen up! There's this dope dude in the city, a man of God, you know? He's totally legit and everything he says comes true. So, we should definitely hit him up and see if he can guide us on the right path, ya feel me? 7. So Saul asked his servant, like, dude, if we go, what are we gonna bring to the dude? 'Cause, like, we don't have any more bread, and we don't have a gift to give to the man of God. What do we have, bro? Like, seriously? 8. Yo, so the servant replied to Saul like, check it, I got this small chunk of silver worth like a quarter of a shekel. I'm willing to give it to the man of God so he can guide us on our journey. It's right here in my hand, man. 9. Back in the day in Israel, when a dude wanted to ask God for some insights, he would say, 'Yo, let's go see the seer, because back then, a Prophet used to be known as a Seer.' 10. Saul was like, 'Yo, good point, dude! Let's bounce.' So they rolled into the city where the man of God was at. 'Good thinking, bro,' Saul said. (That's like saying your words are on point.) 11. As they were heading up the hill towards the city, they spotted some cool girls going out to get water and asked them, 'Is the seer here?' 12. And they were like, yeah, he's totally here in front of you, like, hurry up, he just arrived in the city today. There's, like, a huge party happening today at the high place, you know, like a feast or sacrifice or something. 13. Once you enter the city, you'll find him right away before he goes up to the fancy restaurant. The people won't eat until he arrives because he's the one who gives thanks for the food. Then they can all dig in. So, go ahead and head up there, because at this point, you'll definitely find him. Today, to be specific. 14. And they entered the city, and as soon as they arrived, guess who showed up? Samuel came out to meet them, ready to go up to the high place. 15. So, like, the LORD whispered to Samuel the day before Saul showed up, and I mean, He straight up said... 16. Yo, tomorrow at about this time, I'm gonna hook you up with a dude from Benjamin. You're gonna anoint him as the boss over my peeps in Israel, so he can save them from those Philistines. I've been peepin' my people, 'cause they've been cryin' out to me. 17. When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, 'Look, this is the guy I told you about! He's gonna be in charge of my people, like, ruling and stuff.' 18. So Saul goes up to Samuel at the gate and says, 'Yo, tell me, fam, where's the seer's crib at?' 19. Samuel was like, 'Yo Saul, I'm the seer. Take the lead and go up to the high place. We'll chill and grub together today, and tomorrow I'll give you all the deets about what's on your mind.' 20. Yo, don't stress about those missing donkeys from three days ago anymore, 'cause they've been found! And guess who everyone in Israel is stoked about? Yup, it's you and your whole fam, dude! 21. Saul be like, yo, ain't I from Benjamin, the tiniest tribe of Israel? And my fam is the least of all the families in the tribe of Benjamin. So why you talkin' to me like that? 22. So Samuel took Saul and his homie, brought them into the chill zone, and hooked them up with the top spot, surrounded by about 30 cool peeps. 23. Yo, cook! Bring me that food I gave you and put it right next to you like I told you. 24. Then the chef picked up the shoulder and everything on it and placed it in front of Saul. Samuel said, 'Look, there's still some left! Eat it, it's been saved for you ever since I told the people there would be a feast.' So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 25. And when they came down from the high place into the city, {Samuel} talked with Saul on the rooftop. 26. So, like, they woke up super early. And it was, like, still morning time when Samuel called Saul to go up on the roof, being all like, 'Yo, get up, I gotta send you off.' And Saul got up and they both left, like, outside and stuff. 27. So as they were heading towards the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, tell your buddy to go ahead of us (and he did), but you chill here for a bit, I gotta tell you what God's got to say. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 91. Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name {was} Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. {a Benjamite: or, the son of a man of Jemini} {power: or, substance} 2. And he had a son, whose name {was} Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and {there was} not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward {he was} higher than any of the people. 3. And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses. 4. And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found {them} not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and {there they were} not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found {them} not. 5. {And} when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that {was} with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave {caring} for the asses, and take thought for us. 6. And he said unto him, Behold now, {there is} in this city a man of God, and {he is} an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go. 7. Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, {if} we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and {there is} not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? {is spent...: Heb. is gone out of, etc} {have we: Heb. is with us?} 8. And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: {that} will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. {I have...: Heb. there is found in my hand} 9. (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for {he that is} now {called} a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) 10. Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God {was}. {Well said: Heb. Thy word is good} 11. {And} as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? {the hill...: Heb. in the ascent of the city} 12. And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, {he is} before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for {there is} a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: {sacrifice: or, feast} 13. As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; {and} afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him. {this time: Heb. to day} 14. And they went up into the city: {and} when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place. 15. Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying, {told...: Heb. revealed the ear of Samuel} 16. To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him {to be} captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. 17. And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people. {reign over: Heb. restrain in} 18. Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house {is}. 19. And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I {am} the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that {is} in thine heart. 20. And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom {is} all the desire of Israel? {Is it} not on thee, and on all thy father's house? {three...: Heb. to day three days} 21. And Saul answered and said, {Am} not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me? {so...: Heb. according to this word} 22. And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which {were} about thirty persons. 23. And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee. 24. And the cook took up the shoulder, and {that} which {was} upon it, and set {it} before Saul. And {Samuel} said, Behold that which is left! set {it} before thee, {and} eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day. {left: or, reserved} 25. And when they were come down from the high place into the city, {Samuel} communed with Saul upon the top of the house. 26. And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad. 27. {And} as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God. {a while: Heb. to day} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 101. So Samuel grabbed a bottle of oil and poured it on his head, then gave him a hug and said, 'Isn't it because the LORD chose you to lead his people?' 2. Once you leave me today, head towards Rachel's tomb in the Benjamin region at Zelzah and you'll come across two dudes there. They'll tell you that the donkeys you were looking for have been found. And get this, your dad isn't even concerned about the donkeys anymore, he's worried sick about you! He's all like, 'What am I gonna do for my kid?' 3. After that, keep moving and you'll reach the chill spot of Tabor. There, you'll run into three dudes heading up to Bethel to worship, one with three baby goats, another with three loaves of bread, and another with a bottle of wine. 4. And they'll be like, 'Hey, what's up?' and offer you two loaves of bread, which you'll totally accept from them. It's kinda like a friendly gesture, ya know? 5. So, like, after you hit up the hill of God, you'll find the Philistine crew posted there. And when you roll into the city, you'll come across this group of prophets coming down from the high spot with their musical swag - they've got a psaltery, a tabret, a pipe, and a harp - and they're gonna drop some serious prophetic vibes, you know? 6. And the LORD's spirit will totally come upon you, and you'll start prophesying with them, and you'll totally transform into a whole new person. 7. Yo, when you see all these signs go down, just do whatever you feel like doing, 'cause God's got your back. (And remember, these signs are gonna happen and you can do whatever feels right to you.) 8. So, like, you gotta go to Gilgal first, and guess what? I'll join you later to make some lit burnt offerings and peace sacrifices. You gotta chill there for a week until I arrive and tell you what's up. 9. So, like, after he left Samuel, God totally transformed his heart, and all those crazy signs happened that day. The dude's back was like, shoulder or something, and God just flipped the switch and gave him a brand new heart, you know? 10. So, like, when they got to the hill, guess what? There was this sick group of prophets waiting for him. And, BAM! The Spirit of God totally descended on him, and he started dropping some mad prophecies among them. 11. So, like, when people who knew Saul saw that he was suddenly prophesying along with the other prophets, they were like, 'Wait, hold up! Is Saul, the son of Kish, now one of the prophets too?' 12. Then this person from there responded and was like, wait, who's their dad though? And that's how the saying started, like, is Saul like, a prophet too or what? #deepthoughts 13. And once he was done with his prophecy, he headed over to the lit spot. 14. Saul's uncle asked him and his servant, 'Where y'all goin'?' And he was like, 'Lookin' for the donkeys. When we realized they were nowhere to be found, we went to Samuel.' 15. Yo, Saul's uncle be like, spill the tea and tell me what Samuel told ya. 16. So Saul was like, dude, he straight up told us that the donkeys were found. But when it came to what Samuel said about being king, he didn't mention a word of it. 17. So Samuel gathered all the people and said, 'Yo, let's meet up with the big man upstairs in Mizpeh.' 18. And God was like, 'Yo, Israelites, listen up. Here's what the LORD God of Israel has to say: I totally rescued you from Egypt, saved you from the Egyptians, and freed you from the grip of all those mean kingdoms that were oppressing you. 19. And like, listen up, you guys messed up big time. You straight up rejected your God, who legit saved you from all the tough stuff you went through. And guess what? You straight up told Him, 'Nah, we want a king instead.' So, here's what you need to do: gather up all your squads, your tribes, and your squads within those tribes, and be ready to face the LORD. 20. So, like, Samuel gathered all the peeps from the tribes of Israel, and, bam, it was the tribe of Benjamin that got chosen. 21. So, when the peeps in charge gathered up the tribe of Benjamin, they figured out that Matri's crew was the one. And guess who they found? Saul, Kish's son! But hold up, when they went searching for him, dude was nowhere to be found. 22. So, like, they were like asking the LORD, you know, if the dude was gonna show up there. And the LORD, like, straight up answered, like, 'Yo, check it, he's hiding among the stuff.' 23. So they quickly went and brought him over, and when he stood there in the midst of everyone, he was towering above everyone else from his shoulders and up. 24. Samuel was like, yo guys, check out the one the LORD has chosen. No one else is as awesome as him! Everyone went wild and shouted, 'Long live the king!'} 25. And Samuel was like, 'Yo guys, here's the deal with the kingdom,' and he wrote it all down in a book and put it in front of the LORD. Then Samuel was like, Peacee out, everyone! Go back to your own cribs.' 26. And Saul was like, 'I'm heading back to Gibeah, yo!' And he had these homies with him, you know, a crew of dudes whose hearts God had totally touched. 27. But those wicked people said, 'How can this guy rescue us?' And they looked down on him and didn't bring him any gifts. But he stayed quiet, as if he couldn't hear them. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 101. Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured {it} upon his head, and kissed him, and said, {Is it} not because the LORD hath anointed thee {to be} captain over his inheritance? 2. When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? {care: Heb. business} 3. Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine: 4. And they will salute thee, and give thee two {loaves} of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands. {salute...: Heb. ask thee of peace} 5. After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where {is} the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy: 6. And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man. 7. And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, {that} thou do as occasion serve thee; for God {is} with thee. {And...: Heb. And it shall come to pass, that when these signs, etc} {that...: Heb. do for thee as thine hand shall find} 8. And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, {and} to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do. 9. And it was {so}, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day. {back: Heb. shoulder} {gave: Heb. turned} 10. And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them. 11. And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What {is} this {that} is come unto the son of Kish? {Is} Saul also among the prophets? {one...: Heb. a man to his neighbour} 12. And one of the same place answered and said, But who {is} their father? Therefore it became a proverb, {Is} Saul also among the prophets? {of...: Heb. from thence} 13. And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place. 14. And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that {they were} no where, we came to Samuel. 15. And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you. 16. And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not. 17. And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh; 18. And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, {and} of them that oppressed you: 19. And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, {Nay}, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands. 20. And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken. 21. When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found. 22. Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff. 23. And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward. 24. And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that {there is} none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king. {God...: Heb. Let the king live} 25. Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote {it} in a book, and laid {it} up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house. 26. And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched. 27. But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace. {held...: or, was as though he had been deaf} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 111. So there was this guy called Nahash the Ammonite, and he rolls up to Jabeshgilead with his crew, ready to take 'em down. But the people of Jabesh are like, 'Hold up! Let's make a deal, Nahash. We'll serve you if you make a pact with us.' 2. And Nahash, the Ammonite, was like, 'Yo! Here's the deal - I'll make a pact with you, but first, you gotta let me gouge out all your right eyes. Then, I'll use it to shame all of Israel, straight up.' 3. So, like, the oldies from Jabesh were like, 'Yo, hold up for seven days, okay? We need to send out messages to everyone in Israel and see if anyone can help us out. If no one comes to rescue us, then we'll come join you.' 4. So, these messengers pulled up to Gibeah of Saul and spilled the tea to the people. And let me tell you, everyone just lost it and started bawling their eyes out. 5. Yo, check it out, Saul came back from the fields with the livestock and he's like, 'Yo, why are the people crying?' And they filled him in on what went down with the folks from Jabesh. 6. When Saul found out what happened, he felt the Spirit of God rushing through him and he got super triggered. 7. So, like, he got a couple of oxen and totally cut them into pieces. Then he had messengers send the pieces all over Israel. And he was like, 'Yo, whoever doesn't come join Saul and Samuel, their oxen are gonna get the same treatment.' That's when everyone got super scared of the Lord and they all came out together, totally united. 8. So, like, when the dude counted all the peeps in Bezek, there were, like, 300k Israelites and, ya know, 30k dudes from Judah. 9. And they told the messengers, like yo, go tell the dudes in Jabeshgilead, tomorrow when the sun's blazing, you gonna get some backup, yo. So the messengers went and shared the message with the guys in Jabesh, and they were stoked, man. (help: or, deliverance) 10. So the guys from Jabesh were like, 'Tomorrow we'll come out and you can do whatever you think is cool with us.' 11. So the next day, Saul divided his people into three groups. They sneaked into the enemy's camp early in the morning and fought the Ammonites until it got super hot. By the end, the Ammonites were totally scattered, and only two of them were left standing. 12. Then the people were like, 'Yo, Samuel, who's the one saying Saul should be our king? Get those dudes here so we can straight up execute them.' 13. And Saul was like, no one's getting executed today because the Lord totally came through for Israel and saved us! 14. So Samuel said to the squad, Yo, let's bounce to Gilgal and straight-up revamp the kingdom over there. 15. Then everyone gathered at Gilgal, and they crowned Saul as king before the LORD. They offered sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD, and Saul and all the dudes of Israel were super stoked about it. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 111. Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee. 2. And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this {condition} will I make {a covenant} with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it {for} a reproach upon all Israel. 3. And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days' respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if {there be} no man to save us, we will come out to thee. {Give...: Heb. Forbear us} 4. Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted up their voices, and wept. 5. And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and Saul said, What {aileth} the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh. 6. And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly. 7. And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent {them} throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one consent. {with...: Heb. as one man} 8. And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand. 9. And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by {that time} the sun be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed {it} to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad. {help: or, deliverance} 10. Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you. 11. And it was {so} on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together. 12. And the people said unto Samuel, Who {is} he that said, Shall Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death. 13. And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel. 14. Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there. 15. And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 121. Yo, listen up! Samuel was like, 'Guys, I totally heard you out and did exactly what you asked. I went ahead and crowned a king for y'all!' 2. Yo, check it out, the king is totally in your sight: and hey, I'm older and got that gray hair thing going on; and guess what, my sons are here too along with you: and I've been doing my thing in front of you ever since I was a kid up until now. 3. Yo, listen up! I swear before God and His chosen leader: Have I stolen anyone's stuff? Have I scammed anyone or treated them unfairly? Have I taken bribes to look the other way? If I have, I promise to make things right. No shady business here, I got you! 4. And they were like, 'Yo, you didn't scam us or treat us unfairly, nor did you take anything from anyone's stash.' 5. And he was like, yo, the LORD totally knows it, and his chosen one is also aware, that you can't find anything sketchy on me. And they were like, for real, he's totally got the receipts. 6. Samuel was like, 'Hey fam, it was the LORD who totally raised up Moses and Aaron and led your ancestors out of Egypt.' 7. So like, pause for a sec and let me have a chat with you about all the awesome things the LORD has done for you and your ancestors, in a totally righteous way, before the LORD himself. #blessed 8. When Jacob arrived in Egypt and your parents cried out to the LORD, the LORD sent Moses and Aaron to rescue your parents from Egypt and settle them in this spot. 9. But when they totally spaced out on their dude upstairs, he let them get wrecked by Sisera, the big boss of Hazor's crew, and by the Philistines, and the king of Moab - these guys all came at them with everything they had. 10. So they called out to the LORD and said, 'We messed up, man, 'cause we totally ditched the LORD and started worshipping Baalim and Ashtaroth. But now, please save us from our enemies, and we promise to be loyal to you.' 11. So, God was like, 'Yo, Jerubbaal, Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel - go kick some enemy butt and save my peeps on all fronts.' And you know what? You all ended up chillin' in a safe zone, free from your enemies' clutches. 12. So, when you peeps noticed that Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, was coming at you, you were like, 'Nuh-uh, we want a king to rule over us, 'cause back in the day, when the Lord your God was the one in charge. 13. So, check it out, guys! The king you've been so hyped about and totally wanted? Well, guess what? The Lord went ahead and made him your king. 14. If y'all show mad respect to the Big Man upstairs, serve Him, and do what He says without rebelling, then both y'all and the boss in charge will keep rocking with the LORD your God: commandmentt: like, what He says) (continue...: basically like, sticking with) 15. But if you refuse to listen to the LORD and rebel against His commandments, then the LORD will oppose you, just like He did to your ancestors. 16. So, like, stand up and witness this epic thing that the LORD is gonna do right in front of you. 17. Isn't it the time for wheat harvest today? I'm gonna hit up the big man upstairs, and he's gonna send some sick thunder and rain. Just so y'all can realize and see how messed up your wickedness is, all the sketchy stuff you pulled asking for a king. 18. So Samuel hit up the Big Guy; and the Big Guy sent some sick thunder and rain that day: and everyone was like, super shook by the Big Guy and Samuel. 19. So, like, everyone was telling Samuel, 'Dude, could you like, pray to the LORD your God for us, man? We don't wanna die, you know? We messed up big time by asking for a king, like, that was totally not cool.' 20. And Samuel was like, yo people, chillax: you guys messed up big time, but don't bounce from following the LORD, instead stay loyal to the LORD with all your heart; 21. And don't get distracted by useless stuff, because you'll end up chasing after things that don't bring any benefit or deliverance. They're just empty and pointless. 22. Yo, the Lord ain't ever gonna ditch His peeps 'cause He's all about that reputation, ya know? He straight up stoked to have you as His chosen crew! 23. But like, seriously, I would never even think about disrespecting the Lord by not praying for you. But don't worry, I got you covered. I'll help you out and show you the right path, you know? 24. Just have mad respect for the LORD and straight up serve Him with all your heart, for real. Think about all the dope stuff He's done for you, like seriously, it's crazy impressive. 25. But if y'all keep on doing wrong stuff, all y'all and your king gonna face some serious consequences. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 121. And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you. 2. And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons {are} with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day. 3. Behold, here I {am}: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received {any} bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you. {bribe: Heb. ransom} {to blind...: or, that I should hide mine eyes at him} 4. And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand. 5. And he said unto them, The LORD {is} witness against you, and his anointed {is} witness this day, that ye have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, {He is} witness. 6. And Samuel said unto the people, {It is} the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt. {advanced: or, made} 7. Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers. {righteous...: Heb. righteousnesses, or, benefits} {to: Heb. with} 8. When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place. 9. And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. 10. And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee. 11. And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and ye dwelled safe. 12. And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God {was} your king. 13. Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, {and} whom ye have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you. 14. If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God: {commandment: Heb. mouth} {continue...: Heb. be after} 15. But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as {it was} against your fathers. 16. Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes. 17. {Is it} not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness {is} great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king. 18. So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel. 19. And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto all our sins {this} evil, to ask us a king. 20. And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart; 21. And turn ye not aside: for {then should ye go} after vain {things}, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they {are} vain. 22. For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people. 23. Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way: {in: Heb. from} 24. Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great {things} he hath done for you. {how...: or, what a great thing} 25. But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both ye and your king. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 131. So like, Saul was king for a year, and then he ruled over Israel for two more years. It's like, he was totally in charge and stuff, you know? 2. Saul was like, yo, I'm picking three thousand of Israel's finest. Two thousand went with Saul to Michmash and mount Bethel, while Jonathan led a squad of a thousand in Gibeah of Benjamin. Then Saul sent the rest of the people to chill at their own tents. 3. So Jonathan totally destroyed the Philistines who were hanging out in Geba, and when the word got out, Saul announced it to everyone by blowing a sick trumpet. He was like, 'Yo, all you Hebrews better listen up!' 4. So, like, everyone in Israel heard that Saul totally wrecked a bunch of Philistines and that the Philistines were like super mad at Israel too. And then all the people gathered at Gilgal to support Saul. It was, like, a big deal, you know? 5. So, like, the Philistines, they all got together to like, totally fight against Israel. They had, get this, thirty thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and a ton of people, like seriously, as many as the sand on the beach. And they set up camp in Michmash, to the east of Bethaven, you know? 6. When the guys from Israel peeped their situation and realized it was tight (cuz everyone was freaked out), the people straight up dipped and hid themselves in caves, thick bushes, rocky spots, high-up places, and even pits. 7. So, like, some of the Hebrews crossed over this place called Jordan to get to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was still in Gilgal and his whole squad was straight up shook and following him. (And by 'following', I mean they were trembling, ya know?) 8. So he waited for a whole week, just like Samuel said, but Samuel didn't show up in Gilgal. And everybody started to go their own way, leaving him alone. 9. So Saul was like, 'Yo, bring me a burnt offering and peace offerings.' And he went ahead and offered the burnt offering. 10. So, like, right after he finished offering the burnt offering, guess what? Samuel showed up and Saul went out to meet him, you know, to say what's up and show some respect. (Salute, by the way, means bless in Hebrew) 11. Samuel was like, 'Dude, what did you do?' And Saul was all like, 'Well, I noticed that everyone was ditching me and you didn't show up on time, plus the Philistines were joining forces at Michmash. 12. So basically, I realized that the Philistines were heading towards Gilgal and I hadn't even prayed to the LORD yet. I felt like I had to do something, so I pushed myself and decided to make a burnt offering. You know, like ask for help from the big guy upstairs. It's all about seeking His face or His favor, you know what I mean? 13. Yo, Samuel straight up telling Saul, bro, you messed up big time. You totally didn't follow the command from the LORD your God, man. If you had, God would've totally hooked you up with an everlasting kingdom for Israel. That's a major bummer, dude. 14. But, like, your kingdom is about to end, dude. The big man upstairs, like, found himself a dude who totally vibes with Him, know what I mean? He's giving this dude the title of captain over His people because you haven't been doing what the big man told you to do. 15. So Samuel got up and left Gilgal to go to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul counted the number of guys who were hanging out with him, about 600 bros. 16. So Saul, Jonathan, and their squad stayed in Gibeah of Benjamin, while the Philistines set up camp in Michmash. 17. Then the haters came out from the camp of the Philistines in three groups: one group went towards Ophrah, to the land of Shual: 18. Then some other group went towards Bethhoron, and another group went towards the border that overlooks the valley of Zeboim, facing the wilderness. 19. So, like, there were no blacksmiths in the whole land of Israel, 'cause the Philistines were all like, 'Nah, we can't let the Hebrews create any weapons like swords or spears, you know?' 20. But yo, all the Israelites rolled up to the Philistines to flex their tools, sharpenin' their own share, coulter, axe, and mattock. 21. But they had a whole collection of tools for their work: mattocks, coulters, forks, axes, and even goads that they sharpened. The goads were like a file with multiple sharp edges or a pim, equivalent to a third of a shekel. 22. So, when the epic battle went down, no one, I mean NO ONE, had a sword or spear, except for Saul and his son Jonathan. They were the only ones who came prepared. 23. So the Philistine squad decided to head towards the Michmash area. (garrison: also known as the standing camp) \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 131. Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel, {reigned one...: Heb. the son of one year in his reigning} 2. Saul chose him three thousand {men} of Israel; {whereof} two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent. 3. And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that {was} in Geba, and the Philistines heard {of it}. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear. {Geba: or, the hill} 4. And all Israel heard say {that} Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines, and {that} Israel also was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal. {was...: Heb. did stink} 5. And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which {is} on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven. 6. When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for the people were distressed,) then the people did hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits. 7. And {some of} the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he {was} yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. {followed...: Heb. trembled after him} 8. And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel {had appointed}: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the people were scattered from him. 9. And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering. 10. And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him, that he might salute him. {salute: Heb. bless} 11. And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were scattered from me, and {that} thou camest not within the days appointed, and {that} the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash; 12. Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering. {made...: Heb. intreated the face} 13. And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy kingdom upon Israel for ever. 14. But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him {to be} captain over his people, because thou hast not kept {that} which the LORD commanded thee. 15. And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people {that were} present with him, about six hundred men. {present: Heb. found} 16. And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people {that were} present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash. {present: Heb. found} {Gibeah: Heb. Geba} 17. And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned unto the way {that leadeth to} Ophrah, unto the land of Shual: 18. And another company turned the way {to} Bethhoron: and another company turned {to} the way of the border that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness. 19. Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make {them} swords or spears: 20. But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattock. 21. Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads. {a file: Heb. a file with mouths, or Heb. a pim, a third of a shekel} {sharpen: Heb. set} 22. So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that {were} with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found. 23. And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash. {garrison: or, standing camp} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 141. So one day, Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to his armor bearer, 'Hey, let's sneak over to the Philistines' hideout on the other side.' But he didn't tell his dad about it. 2. So Saul hung out in the farthest part of Gibeah under this cool pomegranate tree in Migron. And he had around six hundred homies rollin' with him. 3. And Ahiah, who is Ahitub's son, Ichabod's bro, Phinehas' grandson, and Eli's great-grandson, was the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, flexing his ephod. And peeps didn't even realize that Jonathan had dipped. {Ahiah, also known as Ahimelech} 4. So like, there were these totally tough rocks on either side of the passage that Jonathan was trying to sneak through to get to the Philistines' place. One rock was called Bozez, and the other was named Seneh. 5. One was positioned to the north near Michmash, while the other was to the south near Gibeah. (Note: In the original Hebrew, the word 'forefront' can also mean 'tooth'.) 6. So Jonathan turned to the dude holding his swag armor and was like, 'Yo, let's roll up to those uncircumcised dudes at the garrison. Maybe the big man upstairs will work his magic for us, no cap. The Lord doesn't need a massive squad to save us, he can handle it with just a few of us.' 7. And his sidekick was like, 'Do whatever you want, man. I got your back. I'm here for you, just like you want.' 8. So Jonathan said, yo, check it out, we gonna roll up to those dudes and let 'em see who we really are. 9. If they're like, 'Yo, just chill here and we'll come to you,' then we're gonna stay right where we are and not go up to them. 10. But like, if they're like, 'Come at us, bro,' then we'll be like, 'Let's do this!' 'Cause, you know, the Lord totally handed them over to us. And that's gonna be, like, our sign, ya know? 11. So, like, the two of them were spotted by the Philistines' crew, and the Philistines were all like, 'Yo, check it out, those Hebrew peeps are coming out of their hiding spots and stuff!' 12. So, like, Jonathan and his buddy with the sick armor were talking to the guys from the enemy camp, and they're all like, 'Yo, come up here and we're gonna show you something cool!' And Jonathan was like, 'Bro, come with me. God totally handed them over to us, dude!' 13. So, Jonathan straight up Spider-Manned his way, crawling on his hands and feet, with his trusty sidekick armorbearer right behind him. They totally owned the enemy, with Jonathan taking them down first, and then his armorbearer finishing them off. 14. So, like, Jonathan and his bro went ahead and straight up owned about 20 dudes in this tiny piece of land, yo! It's like, you could fit half a freaking football field in there. Just imagine, it's the area where a couple of oxen could break some ground. Pretty gnarly, right?! 15. And everyone was shook - the soldiers, the scouts, and the people. They all trembled in fear as the ground quaked with an intense shudder. It was like, super intense, y'know. A real divine level trembling, straight from God. 16. So, the guards of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin were, like, watching, right? And, oh my gosh, they saw that the whole crowd was like disappearing, and they, like, just started attacking each other! 17. So, Saul was like, 'Yo, people! Count and see who's missing.' And after they counted, they found out that Jonathan and his homie with the armor weren't there, man. 18. Saul was like, 'Yo Ahiah, bring that God's ark over here. It's with the Israel fam right now.' 19. While Saul was chatting with the priest, the chaotic commotion in the Philistine camp kept going and getting louder. Saul told the priest, 'Hold up, stop what you're doing.' 20. So Saul and all his homies gathered up and rolled into battle. And yo, everyone ended up turning on each other, like bruh, it was straight chaos up in there. It was a major L, no cap. 21. Also, the Hebrews who were chilling with the Philistines before, they decided to join the Israelites under Saul and Jonathan. They were like, 'Nah, we're team Israel now!' 22. And just like all the dudes from Israel who were hiding out in mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines bounced, they straight up chased after them in the fight. 23. And like, the LORD totally came through for Israel that day, ya know? And the battle like, totally shifted over to Bethaven. 24. And the dudes of Israel were so bummed out that day: 'cause Saul, he swore to the peeps, like, 'Dude, if any of you eat anything until evening, you're totally cursed. I gotta get revenge on my enemies!' So, like, no one even had a bite to eat, man. 25. And all the people in the land went to a grove; and there was honey on the ground. 26. So when the squad entered the forest, yo, they saw honey just drippin', but none of them dared to taste it, 'cause they were spooked by that solemn promise they made. 27. But Jonathan totally missed it when his dad made everyone swear an oath. So he took the rod in his hand and dipped it into a honeycomb. Then he put his hand to his mouth, and suddenly he felt so awake and alert. 28. Then this person from the crew spoke up and said, 'Dude, your dad was dead serious when he made everyone swear not to eat anything today. Any guy who dares to munch on some grub is in deep trouble.' And let me tell you, the people were totally exhausted and starving. 29. So Jonathan was like, 'Yo, my dad totally messed up the land, but check it out, my eyes are lit now cuz I had a sweet taste of this honey.' 30. Bruh, imagine if the squad just went all out and feasted on the loot they took from their enemies today. Like, seriously, there would've been way more havoc unleashed on the Philistines, no cap. 31. So, like, they totally beat up the Philistines that day, from Michmash to Aijalon, and the people were, like, super exhausted. 32. So the people totally went for the loot and grabbed some sheep, oxen, and calves, and straight up killed 'em on the ground. And then they just went ahead and ate 'em, like, with the blood and all. 33. So, they came to Saul and were like, 'Dude, the people are totally sinning against the LORD by eating meat with blood in it.' And Saul was like, 'Wow, you guys really messed up. Bring me a big ol' stone right now.' 34. So Saul was like, guys, go and spread out among the people, and tell them to grab their own cows and sheep and slaughter them here and have a feast. But yo, don't mess up and go against the LORD by eating the meat with blood. And all the people brought their own cows that night and killed them right then and there. 35. So Saul was like, yo, I gotta show some love to the LORD, and he straight up built an altar. This was the very first time he did that to honor the LORD, you know what I'm sayin'? Like, that was the start of it all, ya feel me? 36. So, Saul was like, 'Hey, let's sneak up on the Philistines tonight and raid them until morning. We can't let any of them escape!' And everyone was like, 'Sure, do whatever you think is best.' Then the priest was like, 'Let's come closer to God and seek His guidance.' 37. So Saul was like, yo God, should I chase after the Philistines? Can we get the victory, fam? But God didn't answer him that day. Dang. 38. Yo, listen up y'all, Saul called all the big shots over here! Let's find out what went down and where this sin went down today, you feel me? {chief: Hebrew for corners} 39. Swear on God, the one who saves Israel, that even if it's Jonathan my son, he's gonna die for sure. But no one from the whole crowd had the guts to respond. 40. So Saul told all the peeps of Israel, 'Y'all stand over there, while me and my son Jonathan chill on this side.' And the people were like, Saull, whatever you think is lit, we got your back.' 41. So Saul was like, 'Yo, God of Israel, can you give us a sign to find out who's innocent?' And Saul and Jonathan were chosen, but the rest of the people were like, 'Nah, we out.' 42. So Saul was like, let's flip a coin to decide between me and my son Jonathan. And guess what? Jonathan was the chosen one! 43. So Saul was like, 'Yo Jonathan, spill the beans. What did you do?' And Jonathan was like, 'Well, I just had a tiny bit of honey with the rod I was holding, and now it's like I'm toast, fam.' 44. Saul was like, OMG, you're gonna die, Jonathan! May God seriously punish you even harder! 😱 45. And the people were like, bro, are you seriously gonna let Jonathan die? He literally saved our whole nation! No way, man! I swear to the Almighty, not a single strand of his hair will touch the ground! He totally had God on his side today. So the people stepped in and made sure Jonathan didn't bite the dust. 46. So Saul dipped from chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines dipped back to their spot. 47. So Saul totally took over the kingdom of Israel and like, straight up battled against all his enemies from every direction. He went head to head with Moab, the kids from Ammon, and Edom, as well as the kings of Zobah and the Philistines. I'm telling you, wherever he went, he really gave them a hard time. 48. So, he got all his squad together and totally wrecked the Amalekites, saving Israel from those jerks who were trying to mess them up. #teamwork #victory 49. Saul had three sons: Jonathan, Ishui, and Melchishua. He also had two daughters named Merab (the oldest) and Michal (the youngest). 50. Saul's wifey's name was Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz. The boss of his squad was Abner, Ner's son, who happened to be Saul's uncle. (Abner, you know: Hebrew name Abiner) 51. So, Kish was the OG dad of Saul, and Abner's pops was Ner, who happened to be Abiel's son. 52. There was, like, a total war going on against the Philistines during Saul's reign. And whenever Saul spotted a rad dude with mad strength or awesome combat skills, he'd totally bring him into his crew. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 141. Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that {is} on the other side. But he told not his father. {it came...: or, there was a day} 2. And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which {is} in Migron: and the people that {were} with him {were} about six hundred men; 3. And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone. {Ahiah: called Ahimelech} 4. And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines' garrison, {there was} a sharp rock on the one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one {was} Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh. 5. The forefront of the one {was} situate northward over against Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah. {forefront: Heb. tooth} 6. And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for {there is} no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few. 7. And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that {is} in thine heart: turn thee; behold, I {am} with thee according to thy heart. 8. Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto {these} men, and we will discover ourselves unto them. 9. If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them. {Tarry: Heb. Be still} 10. But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this {shall be} a sign unto us. 11. And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves. 12. And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel. 13. And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his armourbearer slew after him. 14. And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land, {which} a yoke {of oxen might plow}. {an...: or, half a furrow of an acre of land} 15. And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling. {a very...: Heb. a trembling of God} 16. And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down {one another}. 17. Then said Saul unto the people that {were} with him, Number now, and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer {were} not {there}. 18. And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel. 19. And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that {was} in the host of the Philistines went on and increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand. {noise: or, tumult} 20. And Saul and all the people that {were} with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, {and there was} a very great discomfiture. {assembled...: Heb. were cried together} 21. Moreover the Hebrews {that} were with the Philistines before that time, which went up with them into the camp {from the country} round about, even they also {turned} to be with the Israelites that {were} with Saul and Jonathan. 22. Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in mount Ephraim, {when} they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also followed hard after them in the battle. 23. So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over unto Bethaven. 24. And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed {be} the man that eateth {any} food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people tasted {any} food. 25. And all {they of} the land came to a wood; and there was honey upon the ground. 26. And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath. 27. But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that {was} in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened. 28. Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed {be} the man that eateth {any} food this day. And the people were faint. {faint: or, weary} 29. Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honey. 30. How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines? 31. And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon: and the people were very faint. 32. And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, and slew {them} on the ground: and the people did eat {them} with the blood. 33. Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day. {transgressed: or, dealt treacherously} 34. And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay {them} here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew {them} there. {with him: Heb. in his hand} 35. And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first altar that he built unto the LORD. {the same...: Heb. that altar he began to build unto the LORD} 36. And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God. 37. And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day. 38. And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day. {chief: Heb. corners} 39. For, {as} the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But {there was} not a man among all the people {that} answered him. 40. Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee. 41. Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect {lot}. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped. {Give...: or, Shew the innocent} {escaped: Heb. went forth} 42. And Saul said, Cast {lots} between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken. 43. Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that {was} in mine hand, {and}, lo, I must die. 44. And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan. 45. And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: {as} the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not. 46. Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place. 47. So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed {them}. 48. And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them. {gathered...: or, wrought mightily} 49. Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters {were these}; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal: 50. And the name of Saul's wife {was} Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host {was} Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle. {Abner: Heb. Abiner} 51. And Kish {was} the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner {was} the son of Abiel. 52. And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 151. So, like, Samuel told Saul, 'Yo, the LORD was all like, 'I want you to be king over his people in Israel.' So, you better listen up and pay attention to what the LORD is saying, ya know?' 2. Yo, listen up! The big guy upstairs, the LORD of all, he's like, totally remembering what Amalek did to Israel. You know, how he like, totally ambushed them on their way back from Egypt? Yeah, that's what's up. 3. Go out and totally wreck Amalek, like, completely obliterate everything they own. Don't hold back, seriously, wipe out every living thing - men, women, babies, even their farm animals. Everything gotta go, no mercy! 4. So Saul called everyone to gather in Telaim and counted them - we had 200K foot soldiers and 10K dudes repping Judah. 5. So Saul arrived at this city called Amalek and set up camp in the valley. 6. Saul was like, 'Hey Kenites, y'all gotta bounce from the Amalekites ASAP, unless you wanna get wiped out with them. I mean, you were actually pretty cool to all the Israelites back when they left Egypt. So yeah, the Kenites were like Peacee out' and dipped from the Amalekites. 7. So Saul totally wrecked the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is like right across from Egypt. 8. So, like, this dude captured Agag, the Amalekite king, and totally wiped out everyone with his sword, no survivors. 9. So, like, Saul and the people were like, 'Nah, let's not totally wipe out Agag and all the good stuff - the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, and the lambs.' They only destroyed the gross and worthless stuff. You know, the second sort. 10. So, like, God started talking to Samuel and was all like, 11. I'm lowkey bummed I made Saul king because he straight up changed his mind and stopped following me. He didn't even do what I told him to do. Samuel was super upset about it and cried out to the LORD all night. 12. So, like, when Samuel woke up super early to meet Saul in the morning, word came to Samuel that Saul went to Carmel and, yo, he like found a spot and then just like journeyed around and went down to Gilgal. 13. So Samuel went to Saul and Saul said to him, 'Dude, you're totally blessed by the LORD. I totally nailed carrying out the LORD's command.' 14. Samuel was like, 'Yo, why am I hearing all this sheep noise and cows mooing? What's the dealio with that?' 15. Saul was like, 'Yo, they brought back the sheep and oxen taken from the Amalekites. They wanted to sacrifice the best ones to honor the LORD your God, but we totally wiped out the rest. 16. So, Samuel was like, 'Yo, Saul, hold up for a sec. I gotta spill what the LORD told me tonight.' And Saul's just like, 'Alright, go on, spill it.' 17. And Samuel was like, yo, remember when you used to think you were small and insignificant? But like, look at you now - leading the tribes of Israel and being anointed as king by the LORD. Crazy, right? 18. So, like, the LORD was all like, 'Yo, I'm sending you on a mission. Go and totally wipe out those Amalekite sinners. Fight against them until there's nothing left of 'em.' 19. Why didn't you listen to the LORD, but just went after the loot and did something bad in the LORD's eyes? 20. So Saul told Samuel like, 'Yeah bro, I totally followed what the LORD said. I did everything He told me to do. I went exactly where He sent me and brought back Agag, the king of Amalek. And you know what? I totally wiped out the whole Amalekite crew.' 21. But the people snagged some stuff, like sheep and oxen, the top-tier loot that was supposed to be totally wrecked, to offer as sacrifices to the LORD your God in Gilgal. 22. Samuel was like, does God really care about burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as He cares about us just obeying Him? Seriously, being obedient is way more important to God than any fancy sacrifices or offerings. 23. Being rebellious is basically like doing witchcraft, and being stubborn is like committing sin and idolatry. Since you've straight-up rejected the word of the LORD, He's rejected you from being king as well. (divination: Hebrew for witchcraft) 24. Saul was like, 'Yo, Samuel, I messed up big time! I totally went against what the LORD and you told me to do, all because I was scared of what other people would think. I caved in and followed their demands.' 25. So like, please forgive me, and come back with me so we can worship the LORD. 26. So, Samuel's like, 'Nah, man, I'm not rollin' with you anymore. Cuz let me tell ya, you totally dissed the LORD's word, and now the big man upstairs is done with you being the king of Israel.' 27. And as Samuel was about to leave, he grabbed the edge of his cloak and it tore. 28. Samuel was like, yo, God just snatched the kingdom of Israel away from you and gave it to someone else who's way cooler than you, dude. 29. And the Strength of Israel won't ever back out or change his mind: because he's not like us, he's not some dude who regrets. {Strength: or, Eternity, or, Victory} 30. And he's like, I messed up, bro. Can you, like, do me a solid and show me some respect in front of the older peeps and the whole nation of Israel? Also, join me in going back so I can worship your God, man. 31. So Samuel went back to Saul, and Saul showed reverence to the LORD. 32. Samuel was like, 'Yo, bring Agag, the king of the Amalekites, to me.' So Agag came all fancy-like. And Agag was like, 'Bruh, I'm so over the whole fear of death thing.' 33. So, like, Samuel was all like, 'Dude, since you made women lose their kids with your sword, your own mom won't have any kids either.' And then Samuel straight up cut Agag into pieces in front of the LORD in Gilgal. 34. So Samuel bounced to Ramah, and Saul headed home to Gibeah of Saul. 35. And Samuel never saw Saul again until the day he died. But Samuel felt really sad for Saul, and God regretted making Saul the king of Israel. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 151. Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee {to be} king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD. 2. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember {that} which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid {wait} for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt. 3. Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. 4. And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah. 5. And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley. {laid...: or, fought} 6. And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 7. And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah {until} thou comest to Shur, that {is} over against Egypt. 8. And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword. 9. But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all {that was} good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing {that was} vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly. {fatlings: or, second sort} 10. Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying, 11. It repenteth me that I have set up Saul {to be} king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night. 12. And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal. 13. And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed {be} thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD. 14. And Samuel said, What {meaneth} then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear? 15. And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed. 16. Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on. 17. And Samuel said, When thou {wast} little in thine own sight, {wast} thou not {made} the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel? 18. And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed. {they...: Heb. they consume them} 19. Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD? 20. And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites. 21. But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal. 22. And Samuel said, Hath the LORD {as great} delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey {is} better than sacrifice, {and} to hearken than the fat of rams. 23. For rebellion {is as} the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness {is as} iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from {being} king. {witchcraft: Heb. divination} 24. And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice. 25. Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD. 26. And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel. 27. And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent. 28. And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, {that is} better than thou. 29. And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he {is} not a man, that he should repent. {Strength: or, Eternity, or, Victory} 30. Then he said, I have sinned: {yet} honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God. 31. So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD. 32. Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past. 33. And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal. 34. Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul. 35. And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 161. And God was like, 'Samuel, why are you still moping around because of Saul? I already said he's not gonna be king anymore. Get yourself together, grab some oil, and go to Jesse from Bethlehem. I've picked one of his sons to be the next king, so go check them out.' 2. Samuel was like, how can I even go? If Saul finds out, he'll straight up end me. But then the LORD was like, just take a cow with you and say you're going to make a sacrifice to Him. Easy peasy. 3. And hit up Jesse to the sesh, and I'll show you what's up: you gotta bless the one I choose with that anointing. 4. So, Samuel did exactly what the LORD said and went to Bethlehem. When the town elders saw him, they got all jittery and asked, 'Yo, you here for peace or what?' (Btw, 'coming' actually means 'meeting' in Hebrew.) 5. And he was like, 'Yo, chillax. I'm here to make a sacrifice to the LORD, so you all better get yourselves ready and roll with me to the sacrifice.' So he made Jesse and his sons all holy and brought them along to the sacrifice. 6. So, when they showed up, he checked out Eliab and was like, for sure, this is the one that the LORD has chosen. (Eliab is also called Elihu, just FYI.) 7. But God was like, 'Yo, Samuel, don't judge by his looks or how tall he is, 'cause I've already rejected him. People may only care about what's on the outside, but I see what's in the heart, and that's what matters to me.' 8. So Jesse called Abinadab over and had him go in front of Samuel. And he was like, 'Nah, the LORD didn't pick this dude.' 9. So Jesse had Shammah come forward, but the LORD didn't choose him. (Shammah was also known as Shimeah or Shimma.) 10. So, Jesse lined up all seven of his sons for Samuel to see. Then Samuel was like, 'Yo, the LORD ain't picking any of these dudes.' 11. Samuel was like, 'Yo, Jesse, you got any more kids?' Jesse was like, 'Yeah, the youngest one out there, he's just chillin' with the sheep.' Samuel was like, 'Go get him real quick, we ain't about to start the party until he shows up.' 12. So he sent for him and brought him in. And let me tell you, this guy had that great combo of being good-looking and having a nice face. The LORD was like, 'Yo, get up and anoint him, because this is the one.' 13. So Samuel grabbed a bottle of oil and poured it on David in front of his bros, and from that moment on, the Spirit of the LORD became all up in David. Then Samuel bounced and headed to Ramah. 14. Then, like, the LORD's Spirit totally ditched Saul, and this, like, super wicked spirit from the LORD started messing with him. It was, like, hella terrifying, you know? 15. Yo, Saul's homies were like, 'Yo, man! Check it out, there's like this wicked spirit bugging you, straight from the Big Guy upstairs!' 16. Yo, dude, our lord should totally tell his peeps to find a sick musician who can rock the harp. Trust, when you start feeling that bad vibe from the Big Guy, this musician will start jamming and you'll feel hella better. 17. So Saul was like, yo, servants, find me a talented dude who can play some sick tunes and bring him to me. 18. Yo, one of the servants spoke up and was like, 'Check it, I saw this guy Jesse's son from Bethlehem. He's a total pro at playing music, a brave warrior, strategic in battles, smart with his words, good-looking, and you know what? The Lord's got his back, man.' 19. So Saul DM'd Jesse like, 'Hey, send me your son David, he's still doing his sheep gig.' 20. So Jesse packed up a donkey loaded with bread, a bottle of wine, and a young goat and sent them with David, his son, to Saul. 21. So David went up to Saul, and stood before him. And they totally clicked, like, Saul was super into David. And David ended up becoming Saul's personal armor dude. 22. Saul hit up Jesse like, yo, tell David to come through and chill with me 'cause I'm vibin' with him heavy. 23. So, like, there was this time when Saul was all troubled because of this spirit from God, right? And then David, being the genius that he is, whipped out his harp and started playing with mad skills. It totally worked, bro! Saul instantly felt better, the evil spirit bounced and left him alone. Talk about a power move! \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 161. And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons. 2. And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear {it}, he will kill me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the LORD. {with thee: Heb. in thine hand} 3. And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me {him} whom I name unto thee. 4. And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming, and said, Comest thou peaceably? {coming: Heb. meeting} 5. And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice. 6. And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD'S anointed {is} before him. {Eliab: called Elihu} 7. But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for {the LORD seeth} not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart. {outward...: Heb. eyes} 8. Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. 9. Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this. {Shammah: Shimeah, also called, Shimma} 10. Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these. 11. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all {thy} children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither. {down: Heb. round} 12. And he sent, and brought him in. Now he {was} ruddy, {and} withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this {is} he. {of a...: Heb. fair of eyes} 13. Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah. 14. But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD troubled him. {troubled: or, terrified} 15. And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubleth thee. 16. Let our lord now command thy servants, {which are} before thee, to seek out a man, {who is} a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. 17. And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring {him} to me. 18. Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, {that is} cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD {is} with him. {matters: or, speech} 19. Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, which {is} with the sheep. 20. And Jesse took an ass {laden} with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent {them} by David his son unto Saul. 21. And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armourbearer. 22. And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight. 23. And it came to pass, when the {evil} spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 171. So, like, the Philistines got all their squads together to go into battle and they met up at Shochoh, which is part of Judah. They set up camp between Shochoh and Azekah, near Ephesdammim. (Ephesdammim is like this place by the coast called Dammim, also known as Pasdammim. Seriously!) 2. So Saul and the gang of Israel got together, and set up camp near the cool valley of Elah, ready to face off against the Philistines. #BattleModeOn #DavidvsGoliath 3. So, like, the Philistines were chilling on this mountain, right? And Israel was on the other mountain, no cap. And there was this valley in between them, you know what I mean? 4. Yo, there was this straight-up legend coming out of the Philistines' camp, goes by the name Goliath from Gath. This dude was tall AF, standing at six cubits and a span. 5. He had a sick brass helmet on his head and he was totally decked out in a sick chainmail suit. The suit weighed a ton, like five thousand shekels of brass! Yeet! 6. He rocked some sick brass leg armor and had a dope brass shield on his back. (or, gorget) 7. His spear was massive, like a giant knitting needle, and the tip of it weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And he had someone with a shield leading the way for him. 8. And he straight up yells at the Israelite crew, like, 'Why you all up in arms and ready for a showdown? Ain't I a Philistine? And y'all just followers of Saul? Pick one of your own dudes and send him my way, I dare you.' 9. If he can actually take me in a fight and beat me, then we'll be your servants. But if I come out on top and kick his butt, then you'll be our servants, and you better serve us well. 10. So, the Philistine was like, 'Yo, I dare the Israelite armies to send someone out here to fight me, one-on-one.' 11. When Saul and all of Israel heard what the Philistine said, it totally freaked them out and made them hella scared. 12. So, there was this guy named David, who was Jesse's son from Bethlehemjudah, which is pretty cool. David had eight brothers, and he was known around town as an old man during Saul's reign. 13. So, like, Jesse's three oldest sons, you know, they went and joined Saul in the battle. The sons' names? The firstborn was Eliab, then it was Abinadab, and the third one was Shammah. 14. And David was like the baby of the group, and the three oldest dudes hung out with Saul. 15. But David dipped and yeeted from Saul to flex on feeding his dad's sheep at Bethlehem. 16. So, like, this Philistine guy kept showing up every morning and evening for a whole 40 days, you know? 17. So, Jesse was like, 'Yo David, grab an ephah of this fire roasted corn and ten loaves for your homies, then bounce to the camp and hook 'em up.' 18. And bring these ten bomb cheeses to the squad leader of their crew, and see how your homies are doing, and get their signed promise. [cheeses: like, super fresh milk cheeses] [of...: like, the leader of a thousand] 19. So, like, Saul and his crew, and all the dudes from Israel, were chilling in the valley of Elah, battling it out with the Philistines. 20. So, David woke up super early in the morning and entrusted his sheep to a caretaker. He did exactly as Jesse had told him, heading towards the battlefield where the army was getting ready for action. And let me tell you, he was beyond pumped for the fight! 21. So Israel and the Philistines were all geared up for a serious showdown, with armies lining up to face each other. 22. So David ditched his ride with the keeper and ditched into the army, then went and gave daps to his bros. {his ride: referring to his belongings} {gave daps: meaning greeted warmly} 23. So, like, they were all chatting, and then this super strong dude from the Philistine army, this guy called Goliath from Gath, showed up and started saying the same stuff. And then David, like, heard everything he was saying. 24. When the guys in Israel peeped the dude, they were shook and dipped real quick. I mean, they were terrified AF. (Like, his presence could literally make you wet your pants.) 25. Yo, did y'all peep this dude who just rolled up? He's straight up tryna diss Israel! Word is, whoever takes him down, the king gonna hook 'em up big time. Talkin' mad cash, his daughter's hand in marriage, and freedom for his whole fam in Israel. 26. And David was like, guys, listen up! What's the game plan for the dude who takes down this Philistine and totally saves Israel's reputation? I mean, who does this uncircumcised Philistine think he is, trying to mess with the armies of our all-powerful God? 27. And the peeps were like, 'That's totally what's gonna happen to anyone who takes him out!' 28. So, like, Eliab, the oldest bro, totally overheard David talking to the guys. And let me tell you, Eliab was SO mad at David. He's all like, 'Why'd you even come here? Who's taking care of those lame sheep in the wilderness? I'm onto you, man. I know you're just here to check out the battle and show off your arrogance and bad attitude.' 29. And David was like, yo, what did I do this time? Like, isn't there a legit reason for all this? 30. Then he left and approached someone else, speaking in the same way. And the people responded to him just like before. 31. And when people heard what David said, they repeated it to Saul, and he called for David to come to him. 32. Yo, Saul, don't stress out about this Philistine, I got you! Your boy David's stepping up to the plate, ready to throw down in a fight. 33. So, like, Saul said to David, bro, you legit can't take on this Philistine and fight him 'cause, let's be real, you're just a youngin', and he's been a total warrior since forever. 34. So David was like, Yo Saul, listen up, your boy was just minding his own business, takin' care of his dad's sheep, when outta nowhere, a freakin' lion and a bear showed up and snatched one of the lambs from the flock. A lamb is like a baby sheep, BTW. Just sayin'. Oh, and in case you were wonderin', 'kid' can also mean a young goat. Just keepin' you in the loop, fam. 35. So, I chased after him, gave him a good whack, and rescued what he had snatched. And when he tried to attack me again, I grabbed his beard and whacked him once more, and bam, he was no more. 36. I totally took down the lion and the bear, and this Philistine dude who hasn't even been circumcised is gonna be just like them. He's been disrespecting the armies of the Almighty God. 37. David was like, yo, the LORD who saved me from a freakin' lion and bear is gonna save me from this Philistine dude too. And Saul was like, alright David, go do your thing, may the LORD be with you. 38. So, Saul hooked David up with his dope gear – he slapped a sick brass helmet on his head and decked him out with a fresh coat of mail. #Swaggy 39. So David put on his sword and armor, and he wanted to go. But he couldn't do it because he hadn't tried them out yet. David told Saul, 'No way, this won't work for me. I need to test them out first.' And then David took them off. 40. So, like, he grabbed his staff and picked out five totally rad smooth stones from the brook and stashed them in his shepherd's bag, you know, like a bag for shepherds; and he had his sling in his other hand too. Then, he approached the Philistine, ready to take him down. (Brook means like a valley and bag means, like, a vessel in Hebrew.) 41. And the Philistine moved forward and came closer to David; and the guy with the shield was in front of him. 42. And when the Philistine peeped, and spotted David, he straight up dissed him: 'cause he was just a young dude, kinda reddish, with a good-looking face. 43. And the Philistine was like, 'Bro, am I some lowly dog, that you gotta come at me with sticks? Man, the Philistine straight up started cursing David with his gods.' 44. The Philistine was all like, 'Yo David, come at me bro! I'm gonna let the birds and wild animals feast on your flesh!' 45. So David was like, 'Bro, you roll up on me with a sword, a spear, and a shield? Respect. But lemme tell ya, I roll up on you reppin' the Almighty, the God of Israel's armies, whom you straight up disrespected.' 46. Today, the LORD will hand you over to me. I'll defeat you and take your head. And I'll let the corpses of the Philistine army be devoured by birds in the sky and wild animals on the ground. This way, everyone will know that there's a God in Israel. (Note: 'deliver' means 'shut you up' in Hebrew.) 47. And like, listen up everyone, just so you know, the LORD doesn't save using some old school sword and spear, okay? 'Cause the battle totally belongs to the LORD and he's totally gonna deliver you into our hands. 48. So, like, when the Philistine got up and started approaching David, David was all like, 'Oh snap!' and totally sprinted towards the enemy's army to confront the Philistine. 49. And David reached into his bag, grabbed a stone, and threw it at the Philistine. He hit him right in the forehead, and the stone sank into his forehead. The Philistine fell face-first onto the ground. 50. David totally owned the Philistine by using a sling and a stone, he hit the Philistine and killed him. But, no swords were in David's hand. 51. So David sprinted up to the Philistine, grabbed his sword, pulled it out of its cover, and defeated him by cutting off his head. When the Philistines witnessed their brave warrior's demise, they got scared and ran away. 52. So, like, the dudes from Israel and Judah got up and totally started screaming and chasing after the Philistines, all the way to the valley and the gates of Ekron. And, like, the injured Philistines were just dropping like flies along the way to Shaaraim, even all the way to Gath and Ekron, man. 53. So, the Israelites came back from chasing the Philistines, and they totally raided their tents, yo! 54. So David grabbed the head of the Philistine dude and brought it back to Jerusalem, but he stashed his armor in his tent. 55. And Saul was like, totally amazed when he saw David stepping up to take on the Philistine. He was like, 'Yo, Abner, the captain of the squad, who's this kid?' And Abner was like, 'I swear, my king, I have no idea.' 56. And the king was like, yo, find out whose son that young dude is. 57. So, picture this: David comes back from totally owning the Philistine dude, right? And then Abner, this total boss, grabs him and brings him to Saul while he's holding the Philistine's head like, 'Check this out!' 58. Saul was like, yo dude, whose spawn are you, bro? And David was all like, I'm the son of Jesse, your homie from Bethlehem, man. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 171. Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which {belongeth} to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim. {Ephesdammim: or, the coast of Dammim, called Pasdammim} 2. And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines. {set...: Heb. ranged the battle} 3. And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and {there was} a valley between them. 4. And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height {was} six cubits and a span. 5. And {he had} an helmet of brass upon his head, and he {was} armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat {was} five thousand shekels of brass. {armed: Heb. clothed} 6. And {he had} greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders. {target: or, gorget} 7. And the staff of his spear {was} like a weaver's beam; and his spear's head {weighed} six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him. 8. And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set {your} battle in array? {am} not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me. 9. If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall ye be our servants, and serve us. 10. And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together. 11. When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. 12. Now David {was} the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name {was} Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men {for} an old man in the days of Saul. 13. And the three eldest sons of Jesse went {and} followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle {were} Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah. 14. And David {was} the youngest: and the three eldest followed Saul. 15. But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem. 16. And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days. 17. And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched {corn}, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren; 18. And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of {their} thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge. {cheeses: Heb. cheeses of milk} {of...: Heb. of a thousand} 19. Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, {were} in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines. 20. And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle. {trench: or, place of the carriage} {fight: or, battle array, or, place of fight} 21. For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army. 22. And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brethren. {his carriage: Heb. the vessels from upon him} {saluted...: Heb. asked his brethren of peace} 23. And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and David heard {them}. 24. And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid. {from...: Heb. from his face} 25. And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, {that} the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel. 26. And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who {is} this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? 27. And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him. 28. And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle. 29. And David said, What have I now done? {Is there} not a cause? 30. And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner. {manner: Heb. word} 31. And when the words were heard which David spake, they rehearsed {them} before Saul: and he sent for him. {sent...: Heb. took him} 32. And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine. 33. And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for thou {art but} a youth, and he a man of war from his youth. 34. And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock: {lamb: or, kid} 35. And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered {it} out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught {him} by his beard, and smote him, and slew him. 36. Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the living God. 37. David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee. 38. And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail. {armed David...: Heb. clothed David with his clothes} 39. And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved {it}. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved {them}. And David put them off him. 40. And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling {was} in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine. {brook: or, valley} {bag: Heb. vessel} 41. And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the man that bare the shield {went} before him. 42. And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was {but} a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance. 43. And the Philistine said unto David, {Am} I a dog, that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 44. And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field. 45. Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied. 46. This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. {deliver...: Heb. shut thee up} 47. And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle {is} the LORD'S, and he will give you into our hands. 48. And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine. 49. And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone, and slang {it}, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to the earth. 50. So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but {there was} no sword in the hand of David. 51. Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled. 52. And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron. 53. And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents. 54. And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent. 55. And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son {is} this youth? And Abner said, {As} thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell. 56. And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling {is}. 57. And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 58. And Saul said to him, Whose son {art} thou, {thou} young man? And David answered, I {am} the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 181. And, like, after Saul finished speaking, Jonathan's soul was totally connected with David's soul and he loved him, like, as much as his own soul. 2. And Saul grabbed him that day, and wouldn't let him leave his father's house anymore. 3. So, Jonathan and David were tight and they made a pact, 'cause they loved each other like soulmates and shiz. 4. So Jonathan took off his robe, and he gave it to David along with his clothes, his sword, his bow, and his belt. 5. So, David basically did whatever Saul told him to do and he was actually pretty smart about it. Saul was impressed by David's skills and made him the leader of his army. Not only that, but David gained respect from everyone, including Saul's own servants. 6. So, like, when David came back after totally slaying the Philistine, all the ladies from different cities in Israel came out to welcome King Saul. They were singing, dancing, jamming on their tabrets, spreading joy, and playing those three-stringed instruments and stuff. How awesome is that? 7. While they were jamming, the ladies started spinnin' and said, Saull be takin' down thousands, but David be slayin' tens of thousands.' 8. Saul got super mad when he heard what people were saying. He was like, 'They're giving David way more credit than me! They're saying he's got tens of thousands, and I've only got thousands. What else could he want besides the kingdom?' 9. And Saul was lowkey checking out David from that day on. 10. The next day, Saul was hanging out in the house when an evil spirit from God showed up and made him start prophesying. Meanwhile, David was jamming on his instrument like he usually did. Little did he know, Saul had a javelin in his hand. 11. Then Saul yeeted the javelin 'cause he was like, I'm gonna totally hit David all the way to the wall! But David skillfully dodged it not once, but twice. #ninja 12. Saul was shook of David, 'cause the LORD was on his side while ghosting Saul. 13. So Saul was like, 'You're outta here!' and then he was like, 'But you can be in charge of a thousand people now.' And then that dude went out and did his thing, leading the people. 14. David was low-key smart in everything he did, and God was totally vibing with him. #Blessed 15. So when Saul realized that this guy was actually pretty smart, he got scared of him. 16. But, like, all of Israel and Judah were totally vibing with David, 'cause he was, like, always there for them, doing his thing and being all cool. 17. So Saul said to David, check it out, I've got this older daughter Merab, and I'll give her to you to marry. Just show some guts for me and fight the battles for the LORD. Saul was like, I don't wanna be the one to try and hurt you, let the Philistines handle that 18. And David was like, bro, who even am I? And seriously, why should I, or my family, be like connected with the king as son-in-law? Like, why me, man? 19. So, like, when it was time for Merab, Saul's daughter, to marry David, she ended up marrying Adriel the Meholathite instead. 20. So, like, Michal, Saul's daughter, totally had a major crush on David. And, you know, people went ahead and spilled the tea to Saul, and he was totally cool with it. Like, he thought it was all good and stuff. #approved 21. So Saul was like, 'Yo, I'll hook him up with her, to make sure she messes him up and gets him in trouble with the Philistines.' Then Saul tells David, 'Bro, you gonna be my son-in-law, no doubt.' 22. So Saul told his homies, like, talk to David in private and be like, yo, the king is so stoked on you and all his crew vouch for you, bro. So, like, you should totally become the king's son-in-law, ya feel? 23. So Saul's crew went and told David what was up. And David was like, 'You really think it's cool for me to become a king's son-in-law? I mean, I'm just a nobody, not exactly living the high life.' 24. So Saul's squad was like, 'Yo, David said this, bro'. {On...: In other words, it went down exactly like David said} 25. And Saul was like, yo, tell David the king's not after no money or anything, but he wants a sweet revenge on those Philistines. He's like, bring me a hundred Philistine foreskins to show he means business. But low-key, Saul was schemin', tryna get David messed up by the Philistines. 26. And when David's homies told him what went down, he was stoked to become the king's son-in-law, and it wasn't even time yet. (Expired means fulfilled, btw) 27. So, David got up and went with his squad, and they took out around two hundred Philistine dudes. And David brought their foreskins and counted them all out for the king, as proof that he was worthy of becoming the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him his daughter Michal to be his wife. 28. Saul peeped the scene and realized that the LORD was vibing with David, and that Michal, Saul's daughter, was totally into him. 29. Saul was totally shook by David, like, majorly afraid! And Saul's hatred for David just kept growing, like an endless vendetta. 30. So, the top dudes from the Philistines rolled out, and you won't believe it, but after they dipped, David totally outsmarted all of Saul's crew. He became such a legend that everyone thought he was straight-up precious. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 181. And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul. 2. And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house. 3. Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul. 4. And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that {was} upon him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle. 5. And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, {and} behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants. {behaved...: or, prospered} 6. And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick. {Philistine: or, Philistines} {instruments...: Heb. three stringed instruments} 7. And the women answered {one another} as they played, and said, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands. 8. And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed {but} thousands: and {what} can he have more but the kingdom? {displeased him: Heb. was evil in his eyes} 9. And Saul eyed David from that day and forward. 10. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and {there was} a javelin in Saul's hand. 11. And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall {with it}. And David avoided out of his presence twice. 12. And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul. 13. Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people. 14. And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD {was} with him. {behaved...: or, prospered} 15. Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him. 16. But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them. 17. And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and fight the LORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him. {valiant: Heb. a son of valour} 18. And David said unto Saul, Who {am} I? and what {is} my life, {or} my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king? 19. But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given unto Adriel the Meholathite to wife. 20. And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him. {pleased him: Heb. was right in his eyes} 21. And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in law in {the one of} the twain. 22. And Saul commanded his servants, {saying}, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law. 23. And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seemeth it to you {a} light {thing} to be a king's son in law, seeing that I {am} a poor man, and lightly esteemed? 24. And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spake David. {On...: Heb. According to these words} 25. And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines. 26. And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not expired. {expired: Heb. fulfilled} 27. Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife. 28. And Saul saw and knew that the LORD {was} with David, and {that} Michal Saul's daughter loved him. 29. And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David's enemy continually. 30. Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, {that} David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by. {set by: Heb. precious} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 191. So, like, Saul, he talked to Jonathan, his son, and all his peeps who served him, and he was like, 'Yo, let's take out David, man. 2. But Jonathan, Saul's son, was really stoked about David. He let David know that Saul, my dad, wants to kill you. So, like, be super careful and stay hidden until morning in a secret spot. 3. And I'll pull up next to my dad in the field where you're at, and we'll have a chat about you; and whatever I see, I'll spill the deets to you. 4. So Jonathan was like, yo Saul, David is a good dude, don't do him dirty. He hasn't done anything wrong to you and he's been hella good to you. 5. Dude went all-in, risking his life to take down that Philistine warrior. And let me tell you, the Lord totally saved Israel big time! You were there, witnessing the epic victory and probably felt super stoked! So why would you even think about committing such a terrible sin by unjustly trying to kill David? 6. And Saul, like, totally listened to Jonathan, and Saul swore, swearing by the Lord, that he, like, won't kill him. Pinky promise, you know? 7. So Jonathan hit up David and showed him all the tea. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and they chilled together like old times. #nostalgic 8. So there was another epic battle: and David went out and totally wrecked the Philistines, slaying them left and right. They couldn't handle his unstoppable power and ran away scared. 9. So Saul was chilling in his crib, holding a javelin, when an evil spirit from the LORD came upon him. Meanwhile, David was like flexing his musical skills. 10. So Saul was like, totally trying to throw a javelin at David, hoping to hit him against the wall and stuff. But David managed to slip away and, epic move, he launched that javelin right into the wall. Then David made a speedy getaway and escaped in the cover of night. 11. Saul totally sent some peeps to David's crib to keep an eye on him and straight up kill him in the AM. And Michal, David's wifey, spilled the tea and warned him like, 'If you don't get yourself outta here tonight, you're gonna get smoked tomorrow.' 12. So, like, Michal totally helped David escape through, like, a window and stuff. And, he, like, ran away and managed to escape the situation. 13. So, Michal grabbed a picture and placed it on the bed. She also used a pillow made of goat hair as a cushion and covered it with a cloth. (teraphim means image in Hebrew) 14. When Saul sent some DMs to capture David, she was like, 'Nah, he's just not feeling well.' 15. So Saul sent the messengers once more to find David, and he said, 'Bring him to me in bed, so I can get rid of him.' 16. And when the messengers arrived, yo, check it out, there was an image chillin' on the bed, all cozy with a pillow made of goats' hair as its cushion. 17. Then Saul was like, dude, why did you trick me and let my enemy escape? And Michal was like, well, he asked me to let him go, why should I kill you? 18. So David was like, 'Yo, I'm outta here!' and he dipped, making a quick getaway to Samuel's crib in Ramah. He spilled all the tea about what Saul had been doing to him. And then, David and Samuel decided to shack up in Naioth. 19. So, like, someone told Saul, they're like, 'Yo dude, guess what? David is chilling at Naioth in Ramah.' 20. So Saul DM'ed some peeps to snatch David, but when they saw the prophets doing their prophesy thing and Samuel being their leader, the Holy Spirit hit up Saul's peeps and they started prophesying too. 21. And when Saul heard about it, he sent more messengers, and they started prophesying too. Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also started prophesying. 22. Then he also went to Ramah and arrived at a dope spot in Sechu. And he asked, 'Yo, where can I find Samuel and David?' And someone be like, 'Yo, they chillin' at Naioth in Ramah.' 23. Then he went to Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God was with him too. He kept on going and started prophesying, all the way to Naioth in Ramah. 24. So he took off all his clothes and started prophesying in front of Samuel, just like the others. He even stayed naked for the whole day and night. That's why people started wondering, 'Is Saul now a prophet too?' \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 191. And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, that they should kill David. 2. But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret {place}, and hide thyself: 3. And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou {art}, and I will commune with my father of thee; and what I see, that I will tell thee. 4. And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant, against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and because his works {have been} to thee-ward very good: 5. For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest {it}, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause? 6. And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware, {As} the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain. 7. And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence, as in times past. {in times...: Heb. yesterday, third day} 8. And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and they fled from him. {him: Heb. his face} 9. And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with {his} hand. 10. And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the javelin; but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped that night. 11. Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slain. 12. So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and fled, and escaped. 13. And Michal took an image, and laid {it} in the bed, and put a pillow of goats' {hair} for his bolster, and covered {it} with a cloth. {image: Heb. teraphim} 14. And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He {is} sick. 15. And Saul sent the messengers {again} to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him. 16. And when the messengers were come in, behold, {there was} an image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' {hair} for his bolster. 17. And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee? 18. So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth. 19. And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David {is} at Naioth in Ramah. 20. And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing {as} appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied. 21. And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also. 22. Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that {is} in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where {are} Samuel and David? And {one} said, Behold, {they be} at Naioth in Ramah. 23. And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 24. And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all that night. Wherefore they say, {Is} Saul also among the prophets? {lay: Heb. fell} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 201. So David dipped from Naioth in Ramah and went up to Jonathan, like yo bro, what's the deal? How did I mess up? Like what did I do to your dad that he's after my life? 2. And he was like, oh no way, you are definitely not gonna die! Like seriously, my dad doesn't do anything without telling me first, big or small. So why would he keep something like this from me? That's just not how he rolls. No secrets here, man! 3. And David was like, yo, for real, your dad knows I'm chillin' in your eyes. But he's all like, don't let Jonathan know 'cause it'll bum him out. But swear to God, or like, your own soul, man, I'm this close to dying. 4. Yo, bro, Jonathan told David, like, whatever you want, I got your back. Just tell me what's on your mind, and I'll make it happen, ya know? 5. So David was like, 'Yo Jonathan, listen up. Tomorrow's the new moon and I gotta be at the king's feast. But I need to dip and hide in the field until the evening of the third day.' 6. If your dad asks about me, just let him know that David really wanted me to come with him to Bethlehem, to celebrate the annual family gathering. It's a big event, you know! 7. If he's like, 'Yeah, everything's cool, no worries,' then we're all good and I can chill. But if he's like, super angry, then you know he's about to bring some serious bad vibes. 8. So like, be chill and show some kindness to your servant, 'cause you and I are in this covenant thing with the LORD together. If, like, I've done anything wrong, then, you know, take care of it yourself instead of dragging me to your father. Why make things more complicated, right? 9. And Jonathan was like, no way! If I knew for sure that my dad had some evil plan to mess you up, I swear I'd spill the tea and give you the heads up! 10. So David was like, yo Jonathan, who's gonna spill the tea? Like, what if your dad acts all extra when you ask him? 11. Jonathan was like, 'Yo David, let's dip and chill in the field.' So they both bounced and went to the field together. 12. And Jonathan was like, yo, God of Israel, when I talk to my pops tomorrow or the day after, and if he's cool with you, I'll hit you up and let you know, no cap. 13. May God bless Jonathan abundantly and even more. But if my dad wants to harm you, I'll let you know and help you escape so you can be safe. May God be by your side, just like He was with my dad. Let me give you the inside scoop and support you. 14. And don't just be cool to me while I'm alive, show me that sweet kindness from the Lord, so I won't kick the bucket: 15. But like, don't you ever stop showing love to my fam, even when the big man upstairs wipes out all of David's enemies on this planet. 16. So Jonathan and David became besties and they made a pact, like a total bro code, where Jonathan was like, 'Dude, if anything happens to me, may God punish my enemies through you, my bro.' 17. And Jonathan made David promise once more, because he was his bestie: because he loved him just as much as he loved himself. {because...: or, by his love toward him} 18. Yo, David, listen up. Jonathan just told me that tomorrow is the new moon, and you know what that means? Your absence is gonna be noticed, bro. Your seat's gonna be empty, and people are gonna be wondering where you at. 19. Once you've waited for three days, head down without wasting time and go back to the spot where you hid during the important event. Stick around by the stone Ezel. (Quickly: or you can say diligently: Hebrew: greatly) (When the...: Hebrew: on the day of the event) (Ezel: or the one that shows the way) 20. And I'll totally fire off like three arrows on one side, like I'm aiming at a target or something. 21. Yo, listen up! I'm gonna send a dude to fetch the arrows. If I straight up tell the guy, 'Look, the arrows are right next to you, grab 'em,' then you best believe you should come back here quick. It's all good, no harm will come your way, I swear to the LORD. 22. But if I tell the dude, Yo, check it out, the arrows are way past you. Peace out, 'cause the LORD sent you off. 23. And regarding the issue we discussed, you should know that the Lord will always be with both of us, now and forever. 24. So David totally dipped into the field and when the new moon vibes arrived, the king chilled and grubbed on some bomb food. 25. So, like, the king was chillin' on his throne, you know, like he always does, sittin' next to the wall. Jonathan got up and Abner sat next to Saul, but David's spot was totally empty. 26. But Saul didn't say anything that day because he thought, something's gone wrong with him, he's not chill, definitely not chill. 27. The next day, which was the second day of the month, David was not there, and Saul asked his son Jonathan, 'Why isn't Jesse's son here for dinner, neither yesterday nor today?' 28. So, Saul hit up Jonathan and David was like, 'Yo, can I bounce to Bethlehem?'} 29. And he was like, yo, can I bounce real quick? My fam is throwin' down a lit sacrifice in the city, and my bro straight up told me I gotta be there. So, if you're cool with it, can I dip out and kick it with my homies? That's why I ain't showin' up to the king's table. 30. Saul got really mad at Jonathan and said, 'Dude, you're such a troublemaker! I totally know that you're secretly supporting Jesse's son, and it's making things awkward for you and your fam. You can't hide it!' 31. As long as Jesse's son is alive, you won't have any power or a kingdom to call your own. So hurry up and bring him to me, because he's definitely gonna bite the dust. (BTW, he's practically a ticking time bomb!) 32. So, like, Jonathan was all like, 'Dude, why do you want to kill him? What did he even do?' 33. So, like, Saul, full-on chucked a javelin at David to, like, attack him. And Jonathan totally knew that his dad was like, dead set on killing David. 34. So Jonathan was like, super pissed and he didn't eat any food on the second day of the month 'cause he was hella upset about what his dad did to David and how he embarrassed him. 35. So in the morning, Jonathan met up with David in the field like they planned, and there was also a young kid with them. 36. And he was like, 'Yo, dude, go fetch the arrows I'm about to shoot.' And while the dude was running, my guy shot an arrow that went way past him. 37. When the guy reached the spot where the arrow shot by Jonathan had landed, Jonathan called out to the guy and asked, 'Isn't the arrow past you?' 38. And Jonathan shouted to the dude, like, 'Quick, go fast, don't stop!' And Jonathan's dude collected the arrows and went back to his boss. 39. But the dude had no clue what was going on: only Jonathan and David were in on it. 40. So Jonathan handed over his weapons to his homie and said, 'Yo, take these to the city.' 41. Once the dude left, David got up from his spot in the south and fell flat on his face on the ground. He gave three respectful bows, then they hugged each other and cried together, until David cried the most. 42. And Jonathan was like, 'Yo David, peace out, we made a serious commitment to the Lord. We promised that God would always be there for us and our descendants.' 43. So he got up and left, and Jonathan went into the city. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 201. And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? what {is} mine iniquity? and what {is} my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life? 2. And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it {is} not {so}. {shew...: Heb. uncover mine ear} 3. And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith, Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly {as} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, {there is} but a step between me and death. 4. Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I will even do {it} for thee. {Whatsoever...: or, Say what is thy mind and I will do, etc} {desireth: Heb. speaketh, or, thinketh} 5. And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow {is} the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third {day} at even. 6. If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked {leave} of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for {there is} a yearly sacrifice there for all the family. {sacrifice: or, feast} 7. If he say thus, {It is} well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, {then} be sure that evil is determined by him. 8. Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father? 9. And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would not I tell it thee? 10. Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what {if} thy father answer thee roughly? 11. And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field. 12. And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, {or} the third {day}, and, behold, {if there be} good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee; {sounded: Heb. searched} {shew...: Heb. uncover thine ear} 13. The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father {to do} thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father. {shew...: Heb. uncover thine ear} 14. And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not: 15. But {also} thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth. 16. So Jonathan made {a covenant} with the house of David, {saying}, Let the LORD even require {it} at the hand of David's enemies. {made: Heb. cut} 17. And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul. {because...: or, by his love toward him} 18. Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow {is} the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty. {empty: Heb. missed} 19. And {when} thou hast stayed three days, {then} thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was {in hand}, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel. {quickly: or, diligently: Heb. greatly} {when the...: Heb. in the day of the business} {Ezel: or, that sheweth the way} 20. And I will shoot three arrows on the side {thereof}, as though I shot at a mark. 21. And, behold, I will send a lad, {saying}, Go, find out the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows {are} on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for {there is} peace to thee, and no hurt; {as} the LORD liveth. {no hurt: Heb. not any thing} 22. But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows {are} beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away. 23. And {as touching} the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, the LORD {be} between thee and me for ever. 24. So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat meat. 25. And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, {even} upon a seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's side, and David's place was empty. 26. Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he thought, Something hath befallen him, he {is} not clean; surely he {is} not clean. 27. And it came to pass on the morrow, {which was} the second {day} of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day? 28. And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked {leave} of me {to go} to Bethlehem: 29. And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me {to be there}: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table. 30. Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious {woman}, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness? {Thou...: or, Thou perverse rebel: Heb. Son of perverse rebellion} 31. For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die. {shall...: Heb. is the son of death} 32. And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him, Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done? 33. And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David. 34. So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame. 35. And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him. 36. And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. {And} as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him. {beyond...: Heb. to pass over him} 37. And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, {Is} not the arrow beyond thee? 38. And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master. 39. But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter. 40. And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto him, Go, carry {them} to the city. {artillery: Heb. instruments} {his lad: Heb. the lad that was his} 41. {And} as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of {a place} toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded. 42. And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever. {forasmuch...: or, the LORD be witness of that which etc} 43. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 211. So David went to Nob, where Ahimelech the priest was. Ahimelech got scared when he saw David and asked him, 'Why are you all by yourself? Where are your squad?' (FYI, Ahimelech is also known as Ahiah) 2. So David was like, yo Ahimelech the priest, the king told me to do some secret mission and I can't tell anyone what it's all about or where I'm going. Also, I've already sent my squad to a specific spot. 3. So, like, what do you have with you right now? Can you hook me up with five loaves of bread? Or like, whatever you have on you at the moment. Found, you know? 4. So the priest was like, 'Bro, I don't have regular bread here, just this holy bread. But it's only cool for you to have if your squad hasn't been getting busy with the ladies.' 5. Ayo, the priest asked David what's up, and David was like, 'No cap, bro, we haven't been chillin' with any ladies for like three days now. Ever since I left, the homies have been on some holy vibe, and the bread is just regular, you know? Even if it was made sacred just now, it's all good.' 6. So the priest hooked him up with that blessed bread cuz there was no other bread around, just the holy bread that was taken from the presence of the LORD. They swapped it with some fresh bread once it was taken away. 7. So this dude, one of Saul's servants, was at the spot on that day, hangin' out with the LORD. His name was Doeg, an Edomite, the top dog among Saul's herdsmen. 8. So David was like, yo Ahimelech, you got like a spare spear or sword around? I totally forgot to bring mine 'cause I was in a rush, doing some urgent stuff for the king. 9. The priest was like, 'Yo, check it out, David! I got Goliath the Philistine's sword right here, man! Remember when you totally took him out in the valley of Elah? Well, this bad boy's all wrapped up nice and cozy behind the ephod. If you want it, it's all yours. There ain't no other sword like this, bro.' And David was like, 'No way, dude! Nothing else compares to this. Hook me up with that sword, please.' 10. So David was like, 'Nah, I'm outta here!' and he bounced because he was scared of Saul. He ended up going to Achish, the king of Gath.  11. So like, Achish's crew was like, 'Yo, isn't this David, the king of the whole place? Haven't we all heard the hype about him slayin' thousands, while Saul only got his hands dirty with a measly ten grand?' 12. So David took these words to heart and got really scared of Achish, the king of Gath. 13. And dude was like, totally acting all crazy in front of them, pretending to be mad, and scratching on the doors of the gate, even letting his saliva drip down on his beard. Like, he was making some serious marks, you know? 14. Achish was like, 'Yo, fam, do you see this guy acting cray cray? Why'd you bring him to me?'} 15. Do I really need these crazy people that you've brought here to act all insane in front of me? Are you seriously suggesting that I should let this person come into my house? \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 211. Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why {art} thou alone, and no man with thee? {Ahimelech: also called Ahiah} 2. And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed {my} servants to such and such a place. 3. Now therefore what is under thine hand? give {me} five {loaves of} bread in mine hand, or what there is present. {present: Heb. found} 4. And the priest answered David, and said, {There is} no common bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the young men have kept themselves at least from women. 5. And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth women {have been} kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and {the bread is} in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel. {yea...: or, especially when this day there is other sanctified in the vessel} 6. So the priest gave him hallowed {bread}: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away. 7. Now a certain man of the servants of Saul {was} there that day, detained before the LORD; and his name {was} Doeg, an Edomite, the chiefest of the herdmen that {belonged} to Saul. 8. And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste. 9. And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it {is here} wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take {it}: for {there is} no other save that here. And David said, {There is} none like that; give it me. 10. And David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went to Achish the king of Gath. 11. And the servants of Achish said unto him, {Is} not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands? 12. And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath. 13. And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle fall down upon his beard. {scrabbled: or, made marks} 14. Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad: wherefore {then} have ye brought him to me? {is mad: or, playeth the mad man} 15. Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this {fellow} to play the mad man in my presence? shall this {fellow} come into my house? \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 221. So David bounced from there and made a quick getaway to this super cool cave called Adullam. And guess what? When his bros and his whole fam found out about it, they were like, 'Dude, let's go chill with him down there.' 2. And all those who were struggling, in debt, or feeling dissatisfied, came together to join him. He became their leader, and he had around four hundred men with him. (Debt here means owing someone money, and discontented means feeling deeply upset.) 3. So David bounced over to Mizpeh of Moab and he was like, 'Yo king of Moab, can you do me a solid and let my parents crash with you for a bit? I need to figure out what God's plan is gonna be for me.' 4. And he brought them to the king of Moab, and they chilled with him the whole time David was in the fortress. 5. So, like, this prophet dude named Gad tells David, 'Dude, don't just chill in this place. Go yeah, head over to Judah.' And you know what? David's like, 'Alrighty then,' and he bounces to this forest called Hareth. 6. When Saul found out that David and his crew were found, Saul was chilling in Gibeah, posted up under a tree in Ramah. Homeboy had his spear in his hand, and all his homies were surrounding him, you know? 7. So, Saul turns to his crew and says, 'Listen up, peeps from Benjamin! Do you really think that Jesse's kid is gonna hook y'all up with some sweet plots of land and vineyards, and make every one of you big shots leading thousands and hundreds?' 8. Yo, like seriously, all y'all be plotting against me, and not a single one of you has informed me that my own son is in cahoots with Jesse's son. And to make it worse, none of you even have the decency to feel bad for me or give me a heads up that my son has roused my servant to turn against me and scheme behind my back. Can't someone just spill the tea and let me know what's really going on here? 9. So Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul's servants, responded saying, 'Yo, I peeped Jesse's kid rollin' up to Nob to see Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub.' 10. So he asked the LORD about it, and gave him some food, and handed him Goliath the Philistine's sword. 11. So the king hit up Ahimelech the priest, who's the son of Ahitub, and all his homies from his dad's crib, the priests in Nob. And they all showed up to chill with the king. 12. Saul was like, yo, listen up, you son of Ahitub. And the dude was like, yup, I'm here, my lord. (Yeah, he really said 'behold me' 😉) 13. Saul was like, 'Dude, why are you and Jesse's son conspiring against me? You gave him food, a weapon, and even asked God for him, so he could go against me and plot against me today? Like, what's up with that? 14. And Ahimelech was like, yo king, nobody could be as loyal as David, dude. He's like, the king's son-in-law and he does whatever you say, and he's super respected in the kingdom, man. 15. Like, did I even ask God about this guy? No way, dude! Don't even think of blaming me, the king, or anyone in my family for any of this. I seriously had no clue about any of it, whether it was a big deal or not. Seriously. 16. And the king was like, 'You're totally gonna die, Ahimelech, seriously, you and your entire fam.' 17. Then the king told his squad to attack and take out the priests of the LORD because they were on David's side and knew about his escape, but didn't tell me. But the king's crew refused to go after the priests of the LORD. 18. Then the king was like, 'Yo, Doeg, go and attack the priests, fam.' So Doeg the Edomite turns around and straight up goes for it, taking down eighty-five people who were rockin' those fresh linen clothes, ya know? 19. Then he totally destroyed Nob, the city where the priests lived. He went all out, not holding back, and used his sword to attack men, women, children, babies, and even the livestock like oxen, donkeys, and sheep. Absolutely no mercy given. 20. So Ahimelech's son, Abiathar, managed to escape and run away to join David. 21. Abiathar told David that Saul totally wiped out the priests of the LORD. 22. And David was like, yo Abiathar, I totally knew back then when Doeg the Edomite was around that he would snitch to Saul. I lowkey caused the deaths of everyone in your dad's fam. 23. Yo, stick with me, don't stress: anyone after me is after you too, but as long as you're with me, you're protected. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 221. David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house heard {it}, they went down thither to him. 2. And every one {that was} in distress, and every one that {was} in debt, and every one {that was} discontented, gathered themselves unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were with him about four hundred men. {was in debt: Heb. had a creditor} {discontented: Heb. bitter of soul} 3. And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth, {and be} with you, till I know what God will do for me. 4. And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold. 5. And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth. 6. When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that {were} with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants {were} standing about him;) {tree...: or, grove in a high place} 7. Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, {and} make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds; 8. That all of you have conspired against me, and {there is} none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and {there is} none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? {sheweth...: Heb. uncovereth mine ear} 9. Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub. 10. And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine. 11. Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that {were} in Nob: and they came all of them to the king. 12. And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I {am}, my lord. {Here...: Heb. Behold me} 13. And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day? 14. Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who {is so} faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house? 15. Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king impute {any} thing unto his servant, {nor} to all the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more. {less...: Heb. little or great} 16. And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house. 17. And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also {is} with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD. {footmen: or, guard: Heb. runners} 18. And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. 19. And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword. 20. And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David. 21. And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD'S priests. 22. And David said unto Abiathar, I knew {it} that day, when Doeg the Edomite {was} there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have occasioned {the death} of all the persons of thy father's house. 23. Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life: but with me thou {shalt be} in safeguard. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 231. So, like, someone comes up to David and they're all like, 'Dude, guess what? The Philistines are totally attacking Keilah and stealing all the grain!' 2. So David hit up the LORD and was like, 'Yo, should I go and wreck these Philistines?' And the LORD was all, 'Yeah, go ahead and wreck 'em, and save Keilah while you're at it.' 3. Yo, David's crew was like, dude, we're straight up scared chillin' here in Judah. Imagine how much worse it'll be if we roll up to Keilah to face off against those Philistine armies, yo? 4. So David asked the LORD once more. And the LORD replied, 'Get up, head over to Keilah, because I will hand over the Philistines to you.' 5. So David and his squad rolled up to Keilah, straight up throwing hands with the Philistines, raiding their livestock, and straight up wiping them out. David totally came through and saved the crew in Keilah. 6. So, like, Abiathar, Ahimelech's son, he made a mad dash to David in Keilah, and guess what? He had this sick ephod in his hand, fam. 7. So Saul found out that David came to Keilah. And Saul was like, God totally handed him over to me! He's trapped, hiding in this town with gates and bars. 8. So Saul gathered everyone for battle, heading to Keilah to trap David and his crew. 9. And David found out that Saul was lowkey plotting against him; so he told Abiathar the priest, yo bring me the ephod, ASAP. 10. Yo, David was like, 'Sup, LORD, God of Israel! Your boy over here heard that Saul's planning to roll up to Keilah and wreck the whole city just to get at me, like, seriously?! 11. Bruh, are those Keilah dudes gonna snitch on me and hand me over to Saul? Is Saul really gonna roll up like I've been hearing? Yo, LORD God of Israel, I'm begging you, fill me in. And the LORD said, Yeah, he's gonna come down. 12. So David was like, yo, are the people of Keilah gonna sell me and my squad out to Saul? And the LORD was like, yeah, they totally gonna do it. 🙅‍♂️🤷‍♂️ 13. So David and his squad, about six hundred of them, bounced out of Keilah and went wherever they could. Word got to Saul that David had dipped from Keilah, and he decided not to chase him down. 14. So David was out in the wild, chilling in some fortified spots, posted up on a mountain in the Ziph wilderness. And you know what? Saul was on his tail, searching for him every frickin' day. But God didn't let Saul catch him, straight up. 15. So David peeped that Saul was out here, tryna take him down: and David was low-key chillin' in the middle of nowhere, camping in the woods. 16. Then Jonathan, the son of Saul, got up and went to David in the forest, encouraging and empowering him in his faith in God. 17. And he was like, don't worry, bro: Saul my dad ain't gonna catch you. You gonna become the king of Israel, and I'm gonna be right there by your side. Even my dad Saul knows it. 18. And these two bros, like, made a pact before the LORD: David stayed chill in the woods, while Jonathan bounced to his crib. 19. So, like, the Ziphites went to Saul in Gibeah and they were all like, 'Psst, dude, isn't David chillin' with us in these rad hideouts in the woods, on that lit hill called Hachilah, on the south side of Jeshimon? You know, that place in the wilderness and all.' 20. Yo, King! If you really wanna come down and get what you want, we'll make sure he gets handed over to you, like no problem. 21. And Saul was like, Yo, you guys are totally blessed by the LORD 'cause you've shown mad compassion towards me. 22. Hey guys, can you please go ahead and do me a favor? Like, find out where this dude hangs out, who's seen him there, and what he's been up to. Apparently, he's been pulling off some sneaky moves, so I need all the info on him. Thanks! 23. So, like, make sure you check out all the spots where he's hiding and gather solid info. Like, come back to me with the deets and I'll totally join you. And listen up, if he's still in the land, I'll search high and low in every corner of Judah to find him. 24. So they got up and headed to Ziph ahead of Saul, while David and his crew were chilling in the wilderness of Maon, down south near Jeshimon. 25. So Saul and his squad went searching for him. They found out that David had gone to hide in a secluded spot in the wild lands of Maon. When Saul got wind of this, he started chasing after David in the wilderness of Maon. 26. So, Saul went on one side of the mountain, while David and his crew went on the opposite side. David hurriedly tried to escape because he was afraid of Saul. You see, Saul and his crew totally surrounded David and his peeps, aiming to capture them. 27. Yo, bro, a messenger just slid into Saul's DMs, saying, 'Yo, hurry up and come through, 'cause the Philistines straight up invaded our turf. They're all over the place, man.' 28. So Saul stopped chasing after David and decided to fight against the Philistines instead. And because of that, they named that place Selahammahlekoth. (Selahammahlekoth means The rock of divisions) 29. So David dipped from there and crashed at some really cool hideouts in Engedi. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 231. Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors. 2. Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah. 3. And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines? 4. Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 5. So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah. 6. And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, {that} he came down {with} an ephod in his hand. 7. And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars. 8. And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men. 9. And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the ephod. 10. Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the city for my sake. 11. Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will come down. 12. Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver {thee} up. {deliver: Heb. shut up} 13. Then David and his men, {which were} about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah; and he forbare to go forth. 14. And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand. 15. And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and David {was} in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood. 16. And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God. 17. And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth. 18. And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house. 19. Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which {is} on the south of Jeshimon? {on...: Heb. on the right hand} {Jeshimon: or, the wilderness} 20. Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down; and our part {shall be} to deliver him into the king's hand. 21. And Saul said, Blessed {be} ye of the LORD; for ye have compassion on me. 22. Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his haunt is, {and} who hath seen him there: for it is told me {that} he dealeth very subtilly. {haunt...: Heb. foot shall be} 23. See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Judah. 24. And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and his men {were} in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the south of Jeshimon. 25. Saul also and his men went to seek {him}. And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard {that}, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon. {into...: or, from the rock} 26. And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them. 27. But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come; for the Philistines have invaded the land. {invaded...: Heb. spread themselves upon, etc} 28. Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth. {Selahammahlekoth: that is, The rock of divisions} 29. And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 241. So, when Saul came back from chasing the Philistines, he was informed that David was chilling out in the wilderness of Engedi. Just wanted to let you know, fam. #casual 2. So Saul gathered three thousand top-notch peeps from all over Israel and went to hunt down David and his squad in the rocky hangout of those wild goats. 3. So, like, he arrived at this sheepcotes place and there happened to be a cave nearby. And then Saul went inside to take a little break, while David and his squad chilled out on the outskirts of the cave. 4. Yo, David's homies were like, 'Yo bro, remember when the LORD told you that He'll hand your enemy over to you, so you can do whatever you want with him?' Then David was like, 'Bet!' and went ahead and snuck up on Saul, cutting off a piece of his robe on the low. (By the way, it was Saul's robe, just to clarify.) 5. So, basically, after the whole Saul situation, David felt really guilty inside because he had totally snipped off a piece of Saul's clothing. 6. And he was like, no way am I gonna do that to my boss, the chosen one of the big man upstairs. Like, I ain't about to lay a hand on him 'cause he's basically chosen by the big man himself. No chance, bro. 7. So David told his squad to chill and not attack Saul. But Saul bounced out of the cave and dipped out. 8. Then David got up and left the cave. He called out to Saul, like, 'Yo, my dude, the king!' When Saul turned around, David humbly bowed down, like, face to the ground. 9. So David was like, 'Dude, why are you listening to all these people spreading rumors that I'm out to get you, Saul? Like, seriously?' 10. Listen up, fam, today you saw for yourself how the Lord handed you over to me in this cave. Some peeps even told me to slay you, but your boy showed mercy. I was like, nah fam, I can't lay a finger on my lord 'cause he's God's chosen one. 11. Hey Dad, check this out. Look, I've got a piece of your robe in my hand. Just so you know, I only cut off the edge of your robe, I didn't harm you at all. I want you to see that I didn't do anything wrong or break any rules. I haven't done anything to harm you, but you're still after me, trying to capture me. 12. May the LORD be the judge in this situation and seek justice for me against you. But I won't take matters into my own hands. 13. As the OGs used to say, evil comes from those who are evil: but I ain't gonna lay a finger on you. 14. Who's the king of Israel chasing after? Seriously, who's worth all this effort? A dead dog? A stupid flea? 15. So like, may the LORD be the one to like settle this, you know? May He like be the judge and just, you know, decide what's up between you and me? And, like, may He see the whole situation clearly and, like, fight my corner and rescue me from you. You get me? 16. So, like, when David finished saying all this stuff to Saul, Saul was like, 'Hey, is that your voice, my dude David?' And then Saul started crying loudly. 17. And he was like, yo David, you're hella righteous, bro. 'Cause you've been cool to me, but I've been shady with you. 18. And today, you've totally proven that you've treated me well. I mean, seriously, when the Big Guy upstairs gave you the chance to take me out, you didn't even go for it. #Blessed 19. Like, if someone runs into their enemy, are they just gonna let them walk away unscathed? So, like, the Lord should totally give you good stuff for being awesome and doing me a solid today. 20. Yo, listen up. I'm telling you straight, no cap. I know for sure that you're gonna be the king, like, no doubt. And I can guarantee that the kingdom of Israel is gonna be in your hands, no questions asked. 21. So like, promise me, for real, in the name of the LORD, that you won't wipe out my descendants after me, and you won't totally erase my name from my family's record. 22. So, David promised Saul and Saul went back home. But David and his squad headed up to the stronghold. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 241. And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David {is} in the wilderness of Engedi. {following: Heb. after} 2. Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats. 3. And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where {was} a cave; and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave. 4. And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily. {Saul's...: Heb. the robe which was Saul's} 5. And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt. 6. And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he {is} the anointed of the LORD. 7. So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on {his} way. {stayed: Heb. cut off} 8. David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself. 9. And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt? 10. Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and {some} bade {me} kill thee: but {mine eye} spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he {is} the LORD'S anointed. 11. Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that {there is} neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it. 12. The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. 13. As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee. 14. After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea. 15. The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand. {deliver: Heb. judge} 16. And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, {Is} this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept. 17. And he said to David, Thou {art} more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil. 18. And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not. {delivered: Heb. shut up} 19. For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day. 20. And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand. 21. Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house. 22. And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 251. So, like, Samuel passed away and all the Israelites gathered up and were like, super sad, you know? They had this big funeral for him at his house in Ramah. And then David, he got up and headed on down to this desert area called Paran. 2. Yo, there was this dude in Maon, his crib was in Carmel. This guy was straight up rich, owning three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was in Carmel, shearing his sheep and handling his business, you know? 3. So there was this guy named Nabal, and he was married to this awesome woman named Abigail. Abigail was not only super smart, but also had a really pretty face. But Nabal, on the other hand, was just rude and did a lot of bad stuff. Oh, and by the way, Nabal was part of Caleb's family. 4. So David found out while he was out in the wild that Nabal was busy shearing his sheep. 5. So David DM'd ten of his bros and was like, 'Yo, squad, head over to Carmel and hit up Nabal. Tell him I'm saying what's up in my name: peace out!' 6. And this is how you should say to someone who's doing well in life: 'Hey, hope everything's chill for you, peace to you and your fam, and may peace be with all your stuff.' 7. Yo, I just got the word that you've hired some shearers. Just so you know, when your crew was rollin' with us, we never disrespected or messed with them at all. They were chill the whole time in Carmel. (Note: 'hurt' in Hebrew means 'shamed') 8. Go ask your squad, they'll fill you in. Let the squad please you, because we're having a lit time. Just give whatever you got to your homies and to your boy David. 9. And when David's squad pulled up, they straight up approached Nabal and dropped David's message. And then they bounced. #MicDrop #DavidSquadOut 10. And Nabal was like, who's this David guy? And who's Jesse's son? There are so many servants nowadays who ditch their masters. 11. So, like, should I really hand over my food and stuff that I prepared for my crew to random dudes that I don't even know where they came from? 12. So David's squad bounced back, and they came back and spilled all the tea to him. 13. And David was like, 'Yo, squad, equip yourselves with swords!' So all the boys strapped on their swords, including David himself. Then, about four hundred homies rolled with David, while two hundred stayed behind to guard the stuff. 14. So, like, this young dude goes up to Abigail, Nabal's wife, and he's all like, 'Guess what? David sent his people from the middle of nowhere to greet our boss, but dude totally dissed them.' (BTW, to diss them, he literally flew at them with harsh words.) 15. The guys were really cool to us, and nothing bad happened to us. We didn't lose or miss anything while we were hanging out with them in the fields. 16. They were like our ultimate squad, protecting us day and night while we hung out, watching over those sheep. 17. So, like, you need to, like, think about what you're gonna do, okay? 'Cause there's some serious trouble coming our way, and it's directed straight at our boss and his entire fam. This guy is, like, the definition of trouble, making it impossible for anyone to even talk to him. 18. Abigail quickly grabbed 200 loaves, 2 bottles of wine, 5 sheep all prepared for feasting, 5 servings of roasted corn, 100 clusters of raisins, and 200 cakes of figs. She loaded them all up on donkeys like a boss. (Note: 'clusters' could also mean 'lumps' btw) 19. Yo, she said to her crew, 'Y'all go ahead of me, I'm comin' right after. But she didn't spill the tea to her hubby, Nabal'. 20. As she was riding on the donkey, she went down the hill, and guess what? David and his squad came down towards her, and they bumped into each other. 21. So like, David was thinking, man, I've totally wasted my time protecting this dude's stuff out in the wild. I made sure nothing got lost, and how does he repay me? With straight up negativity after I showed him kindness. Like, seriously?! 22. And God will do even worse to David's enemies. If I leave even a single one of them alive come morning, I swear on everything I hold dear. 23. When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her ride, humbly fell before him, and bowed down to the ground. 24. And I like totally crashed down at his feet and was like, yo bro, put this blame on me, and like pretty please, let me speak to you and like, hear me out, dude. 25. Please, don't pay attention to this worthless guy named Nabal, my lord. His name suits him perfectly because he's nothing but a fool. But I, your servant, didn't see the young men you sent, my lord. 26. Yo, listen up, my dude! Swear to the Lord above and swear on your own life that the Lord stopped you from messin' up and takin' matters into your own hands. Now, let your enemies and all those tryna do evil to you, be like Nabal. (Avenging...: In other words, savin' yourself) 27. And like, yo, this really dope blessing that your girl brought for you, lord, you should totally share it with your squad of youngins who be following you and stuff. Blessing, gift, whatever you wanna call it. They walk at your feet and all that, ya know? 28. Hey, can you please forgive me for any mistakes I've made? I know that God will definitely bless you with a stable and successful future, because you're always standing up for what's right and never doing anything wrong. 29. But there's a guy chasing you, trying to harm you. But my lord's soul will be safe and protected by the Lord your God, like a precious bundle. And as for your enemies, their souls will be thrown away by God, like when you flick something out of a sling. 30. And when the LORD makes good on all the amazing things He has promised to do for you, my lord, and makes you the ruler of Israel; 31. Just so you know, my lord, don't feel bad or troubled because you didn't actually harm anyone for no reason or because you took revenge. But when the LORD blesses you, remember your loyal servant here. 32. And David was like, yo Abigail, big shoutout to the LORD God of Israel for sending you my way today: 33. And shoutout to your wisdom, and shoutout to you, for keeping me from getting violent and taking matters into my own hands today. 34. I swear, as the LORD God of Israel lives, He saved me from hurting you. If you hadn't rushed to meet me, there wouldn't be anyone left from Nabal's crew by morning light - not even guys taking a leak. 35. So David took what she gave him and said, 'You can go back to your crib in peace. I've listened to you and I'm cool with you.' 36. So Abigail went to Nabal's place and, whoa, he was partying hard like a king! Nabal was feeling extra hyped because he was super wasted. That's why Abigail didn't bother telling him anything, not even a single word, until the next morning. 37. The next morning, once Nabal sobered up and his wife filled him in, he completely lost hope and turned into a literal rock. 38. So, like, after like ten days or whatever, God totally struck Nabal and he ended up dying. 39. When David found out that Nabal kicked the bucket, he was like, Praisee the Lord for taking care of me when Nabal dissed me, and for keeping me safe from harm.' Yeah, God totally made sure that Nabal got what he deserved. So David hit up Abigail and asked her to be his wife. 40. So like, when David's crew rolls up to Abigail in Carmel, they're all like, 'Yo, David totally sent us to ask if you wanna be his wifey, you down? 41. And she got up, and bowed down, her face on the ground, and said, Look, I'm your girl, totally down to be a servant and wash the feet of my lord's crew. 42. Abigail was like, 'Gotta go!' She hopped on a donkey, with her squad of five girls right behind her. She followed David's messengers and ended up becoming his wife. {at her feet: in submission to her} 43. David married Ahinoam from Jezreel, and she became one of his wives too. 44. Saul gave Michal, David's wife, to Phalti (also known as Phaltiel), the son of Laish from Gallim. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 251. And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran. 2. And {there was} a man in Maon, whose possessions {were} in Carmel; and the man {was} very great, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. {possessions: or, business} 3. Now the name of the man {was} Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail: and {she was} a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man {was} churlish and evil in his doings; and he {was} of the house of Caleb. 4. And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep. 5. And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name: {greet...: Heb. ask him in my name of peace} 6. And thus shall ye say to him that liveth {in prosperity}, Peace {be} both to thee, and peace {be} to thine house, and peace {be} unto all that thou hast. 7. And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel. {hurt: Heb. shamed} 8. Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David. 9. And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased. {ceased: Heb. rested} 10. And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who {is} David? and who {is} the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master. 11. Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give {it} unto men, whom I know not whence they {be}? {flesh: Heb. slaughter} 12. So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings. 13. And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff. 14. But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them. {railed...: Heb. flew upon them} 15. But the men {were} very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields: {hurt: Heb. shamed} 16. They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep. 17. Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he {is such} a son of Belial, that {a man} cannot speak to him. 18. Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched {corn}, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid {them} on asses. {clusters: or, lumps} 19. And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal. 20. And it was {so, as} she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them. 21. Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this {fellow} hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that {pertained} unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good. 22. So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave of all that {pertain} to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. 23. And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, 24. And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, {upon} me {let this} iniquity {be}: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid. {audience: Heb. ears} 25. Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, {even} Nabal: for as his name {is}, so {is} he; Nabal {is} his name, and folly {is} with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send. {regard: Heb. lay it to his heart} {Nabal: that is, Fool} 26. Now therefore, my lord, {as} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to {shed} blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal. {avenging...: Heb. saving thyself} 27. And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord. {blessing: or, present} {follow...: Heb. walk at the feet of, etc} 28. I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee {all} thy days. 29. Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, {as out} of the middle of a sling. {as out...: Heb. in the midst of the bought of a sling} 30. And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel; 31. That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid. {no grief: Heb. no staggering, or, stumbling} 32. And David said to Abigail, Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me: 33. And blessed {be} thy advice, and blessed {be} thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to {shed} blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand. 34. For in very deed, {as} the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall. 35. So David received of her hand {that} which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person. 36. And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart {was} merry within him, for he {was} very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light. 37. But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became {as} a stone. 38. And it came to pass about ten days {after}, that the LORD smote Nabal, that he died. 39. And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed {be} the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife. 40. And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take thee to him to wife. 41. And she arose, and bowed herself on {her} face to the earth, and said, Behold, {let} thine handmaid {be} a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord. 42. And Abigail hasted, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife. {after her: Heb. at her feet} 43. David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives. 44. But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which {was} of Gallim. {Phalti: also called, Phaltiel} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 261. So, like, the Ziphites went to Saul in Gibeah and were all like, 'Psst, do you know David is totally hiding out in the hill of Hachilah, right in front of Jeshimon? Like, for real'? 2. So Saul flexed and dipped to the wilderness of Ziph, rolling deep with three thousand top-notch dudes from Israel, all ready to hunt down David in the wilderness of Ziph. 3. So Saul set up camp on the hill of Hachilah, near Jeshimon, on the way. But David stayed in the wilderness, and he noticed that Saul was following him into the wilderness. 4. So David sent out spies and found out that Saul had actually arrived. 5. So David got up and went to where Saul had set up camp. When David arrived, he saw where Saul was sleeping, along with Abner, the son of Ner, who was in charge of his army. Saul was sleeping in the middle of the camp, surrounded by his soldiers. 6. So David was like, talking to Ahimelech the Hittite, and Abishai, who's like Joab's bro, and he's all like, 'Yo, who's gonna come with me to Saul's camp?' And Abishai is like, 'Dude, I'm down, I'll go with you.' 7. So David and Abishai slid into the scene like stealthy ninjas: lo and behold, Saul was passed out in the ditch, with his weapon stuck in the ground beside him. And Abner and his entourage were snoozing nearby. 8. Abishai was like, 'Yo, David! God totally handed over your enemy to you today. So, let me just whack him real quick with my spear and finish him off in one shot. No need for a second strike.' 9. And David was like, 'Yo, Abishai, don't wreck him, because you can't just go and attack someone who's been chosen by the Lord, all holy and stuff. That ain't gonna make you innocent.' 10. David was like, yo, I swear to God, He's gonna totally wreck him. Either he'll die, or he'll straight up get messed up in a fight and lose. 11. OMG, like, no way I'm gonna harm the chosen one of the LORD. But hey, could you, like, grab the spear and water jug that are near him and let's bounce? 12. So David grabbed the spear and the water bottle from Saul's pillow; and they bounced out of there, and nobody peeped, nor knew a thing, because everyone was knocked out; 'cause the Lord made them all pass out. 13. So David went to the other side and stood on top of a hill at a good distance from them: 14. David shouted to the crowd and called out to Abner, son of Ner, asking him, 'Hey Abner, are you not gonna respond? Then Abner replied, 'Dude, who do you think you are, yelling at the king?' 15. David was like, 'Yo Abner, aren't you like, a total legend? I mean, who's even close to being as awesome as you in all of Israel? So why didn't you protect our king, bro? Some random dude tried to take him out, man.' 16. Dude, what you did was totally not cool. I swear, if I were God, you'd be in big trouble because you didn't protect the Lord's chosen one, your master. Now look, the spear and water jug that were right by his head are gone. And let me tell you, that's super serious business. 17. Saul recognized David's voice and asked, 'Is that you, David, my dude?' And David replied, 'Yeah man, it's me! Your boy, your majesty!'} 18. And he was like, dude, why are you totally chasing me like this? What did I even do? Like, is there some kind of bad thing I did that I don't even know about? 19. Yo, listen up, King! Hear what I gotta say. If God's the one who's got you coming after me, then let Him accept an offering. But if it's just some mortal humans behind it, then they're straight up cursed by the LORD. They've kicked me out and made me lose my place in God's promises, telling me to go worship other gods. Like, seriously? 20. So like, please don't let my blood hit the ground in front of the LORD, 'cause the king of Israel is out here chasing after a tiny little bug, just like when someone hunts a bird in the mountains. 21. Saul was like, dude, I messed up big time. David, my bro, please come back! I promise I won't mess with you anymore because I realized how important you are to me today. Man, I acted like a fool and made a huge mistake. 22. And Dav1d was like, 'Yo, check out the king's spear! Can someone from the squad come and grab it for him?' 23. May the LORD repay each person according to their righteousness and faithfulness. The LORD has handed you over to me today, but I won't lay a finger on the LORD's chosen one. 24. Hey, listen up! Just like your life is super important to me today, I'm asking for the same kinda importance from the LORD. I'm counting on Him to save me from all the tough times ahead. 25. Saul was like, 'Yo David, you're blessed, my dude! You're gonna achieve some insane stuff and come out on top.' Then David was like, Wordd!' and went on his journey, while Saul went back to where he came from. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 261. And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, {which is} before Jeshimon? 2. Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph. 3. And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which {is} before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness. 4. David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed. 5. And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him. {trench: or, midst of his carriages} 6. Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee. 7. So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him. 8. Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not {smite} him the second time. {delivered: Heb. shut up} 9. And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed, and be guiltless? 10. David said furthermore, {As} the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish. 11. The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that {is} at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go. 12. So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw {it}, nor knew {it}, neither awaked: for they {were} all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them. 13. Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space {being} between them: 14. And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who {art} thou {that} criest to the king? 15. And David said to Abner, {Art} not thou a {valiant} man? and who {is} like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord. 16. This thing {is} not good that thou hast done. {As} the LORD liveth, ye {are} worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear {is}, and the cruse of water that {was} at his bolster. {worthy to die: Heb. the sons of death} 17. And Saul knew David's voice, and said, {Is} this thy voice, my son David? And David said, {It is} my voice, my lord, O king. 18. And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil {is} in mine hand? 19. Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if {they be} the children of men, cursed {be} they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods. {accept: Heb. smell} {abiding: Heb. cleaving} 20. Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains. 21. Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly. 22. And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it. 23. The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into {my} hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD'S anointed. 24. And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation. 25. Then Saul said to David, Blessed {be} thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great {things}, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 271. So David thought to himself, man, I'm totally doomed if I stick around Saul. The best move for me is to bounce real quick to Philistine territory. Once I do that, Saul will totally give up on trying to find me anywhere in Israel. That's how I'll escape his clutches. #SurvivalMode 2. So David got up and went with his squad of six hundred peeps to meet Achish, the son of Maoch, the big boss of Gath. 3. So David was chilling with Achish in Gath, along with his squad - each one with their fam. Yeah, David was there too with his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail from Carmel, who used to be Nabal's wife. 4. So Saul found out that David went to Gath and stopped looking for him. 5. So, David was like, 'Yo, Achish! If you think I'm cool and all, let me chill in a town instead of the fancy royal city. I mean, I'm just your servant, ya know?' 6. So Achish was like, 'Yo, here's Ziklag for you' and from that day on, Ziklag became part of the kings of Judah till now. 7. So David basically hung out in Philistine territory for like a whole year and four months. That's like a really long time, bro. Like, seriously, it was a crazy long time. You feel me? 8. So David and his squad rolled up and straight up wrecked the Geshurites, Gezrites, and Amalekites. Like, these nations had been living in the land for a minute, all the way from Shur to Egypt. *Note: Gezrites could also be called Gerzites, just FYI. 9. So David totally wrecked the place, didn't spare anyone, and scooped up all the sheep, oxen, donkeys, camels, and cool clothes. After that, he made his way back to Achish. 10. Achish asked, 'Where did you guys go today?' And David replied, 'We went down to the south of Judah, and to the south of the Jerahmeelites, and to the south of the Kenites.' 11. So David spared no one, man or woman, to send a message to Gath, because he didn't want them spreading the word about what he did. He wanted to make it clear that his actions would always be the same while he was living among the Philistines. 12. Achish straight up believed David, like, he made his own peeps in Israel totally hate him. So, David's being all loyal and serving Achish forever, fam. Like, no joke, they're tight now. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 271. And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: {there is} nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand. {perish: Heb. be consumed} 2. And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that {were} with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 3. And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, {even} David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife. 4. And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he sought no more again for him. 5. And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee? 6. Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day. 7. And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was a full year and four months. {the time: Heb. the number of days} {a full year: Heb. a year of days} 8. And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those {nations were} of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt. {Gezrites: or, Gerzites} 9. And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to Achish. 10. And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites. {Whither...: or, Did you not make a road, etc} 11. And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring {tidings} to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David, and so {will be} his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the Philistines. 12. And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant for ever. {utterly...: Heb. to stink} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 281. So, like, back in the day, the Philistines decided to join forces and gear up for a major fight against Israel. And Achish straight up told David, 'Yo, no doubt, you're rolling with me and your crew to the battlefield.' 2. And David was like, yo Achish, you're about to witness some epic skills from your boy. And Achish was like, bet! I'm appointing you as my right-hand homie forever! 3. So, like, Samuel had passed away and everyone in Israel was really sad about it. They had a big funeral for him in Ramah, which is his hometown and stuff. Oh, and Saul totally got rid of all the people who were into ghost stuff and magic and stuff like that. He was like, 'Nah, fam, we're not about that life anymore' and kicked them outta the land. 4. So the Philistines all got together and set up camp in Shunem, and Saul brought all of Israel together and they set up camp in Gilboa. 5. And when Saul spotted the army of the Philistines, he got majorly scared, and his heart was shaking like crazy. 6. So, like, Saul went and asked the LORD, but the LORD was like totally ghosting him. No response, no dreams, no Urim, no prophets. Nada. 7. So, like, Saul was all like, 'Yo, dudes, find me this chick who's, like, some kind of mystical genius, so I can talk to her, you know?' And his bros were all, 'Dude, there's totally this lady in Endor who's got the hookup with that familiar spirit thing.' 8. So Saul put on a different outfit and went with two dudes to see the woman at night. He was like, 'Yo, can you use some kind of supernatural power to summon the person I'm gonna tell you about?' 9. So, like, this woman was all like, 'Yo, you know what Saul did, right? He straight up got rid of all the peeps who were into that whole spirit communication and wizardry stuff in the land. So why are you trying to trap me and make me die?' 10. And Saul swore to her by the LORD, like, seriously, saying, 'I swear on God, nothing bad is gonna go down because of this.' 11. The woman was like, 'Yo, who you want me to summon?' And he's all like, 'Summon Samuel for me, fam.' 12. When the woman saw Samuel, she straight up freaked out and started yelling loudly. She went up to Saul and was like, 'Dude, why did you trick me? You're totally Saul!' 13. Then the king was like, don't stress: what did you see? And the woman was like, yo Saul, I saw some gods coming up from the ground. 14. And he's like, 'Yo, what's this dude look like?' And she's all like, 'Yeah, it's an old dude coming up, and he's wearing a cloak.' And Saul's like, 'Oh snap, that's Samuel!' So he straight up bows down with his face to the ground and shows mad respect. 15. Samuel was like, 'Dude, why did you disturb my peace by calling me up?' And Saul was like, 'Bro, I'm totally freaking out here! The Philistines be waging war on me, and it feels like God ghosted me! I'm not getting any answers, not from the prophets or even in my dreams. That's why I reached out to you, hoping you could tell me what steps to take.' 16. Samuel was like, dude, why are you even asking me when you know the LORD has left you and is against you now? 17. And the LORD totally did what he said through me: he snatched the kingdom away from you and gave it to your friend, David. Like, it's totally his now. #SorryNotSorry 18. You didn't listen to the LORD's voice or unleash His fierce anger on Amalek, so that's why the LORD made this happen to you today. 19. And like, the LORD is gonna let the Philistines conquer Israel with you, ya know? Tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me, man. The LORD's gonna deliver the whole army of Israel to the Philistines, dude. 20. Saul totally collapsed on the ground and freaked out big time because of what Samuel said. He was completely drained and weak, probably because he hadn't eaten anything all day or night. 21. The woman went to Saul and saw that he was really stressed. She said to him, 'Look, I've followed your orders and put myself at risk. I listened to everything you told me.' 22. So like, please, just listen up, alright? Give me a sec to do something nice for ya. I'll hook you up with a little piece of bread to eat so you'll have the energy to continue on your journey. 23. But like, he was all like, 'Nah, I'm good, not gonna eat.' But then his peeps, along with the chick, were like, 'Come on, dude!' And he actually listened, got up from the floor, and plopped himself onto the bed. 24. So the woman had a total chonker of a calf at home. She quickly got to work and slaughtered it, then grabbed some flour, kneaded it like a boss, and baked some totally unleavened bread out of it: 25. And she brought it to Saul and his squad; and they chowed down. Then they bounced and dipped that night. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 281. And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men. 2. And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I make thee keeper of mine head for ever. 3. Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land. 4. And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa. 5. And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled. 6. And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets. 7. Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And his servants said to him, Behold, {there is} a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor. 8. And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me {him} up, whom I shall name unto thee. 9. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die? 10. And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, {As} the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing. 11. Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel. 12. And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou {art} Saul. 13. And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth. 14. And he said unto her, What form {is} he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he {is} covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it {was} Samuel, and he stooped with {his} face to the ground, and bowed himself. {What...: Heb. What is his form?} 15. And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do. {by prophets: Heb. by the hand of prophets} 16. Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy? 17. And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy neighbour, {even} to David: {to him: or, for himself} {me: Heb. mine hand} 18. Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the LORD done this thing unto thee this day. 19. Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow {shalt} thou and thy sons {be} with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines. 20. Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night. {fell...: Heb. made haste, and fell with the fulness of his stature} 21. And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me. 22. Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way. 23. But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed. 24. And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded {it}, and did bake unleavened bread thereof: 25. And she brought {it} before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 291. So, like, the Philistines got together all their armies and headed to Aphek, while the Israelites set up camp by this cool fountain in Jezreel. 2. And the leaders of the Philistines moved forward in groups of hundreds and thousands, while David and his crew stayed in the rear with Achish. 3. The Philistine leaders were like, why are these Hebrews hanging around? And Achish, one of the Philistine leaders, was like, hey guys, isn't this David? He used to serve Saul, the King of Israel. He's been with me for a while now, and honestly, I haven't found anything wrong with him since he started chilling with us. 4. The Philistine leaders got super angry at him and said, 'Send this guy back home so he doesn't mess things up in the battle. How can he make up with his master if he fights against us? He should stick with his own people!' 5. Yo, isn't this David, the dude they were hyping up in the dances, like Saull handled a few, but David straight up owned the ten thousands'? 6. So Achish called David and told him, 'You've been cool and trustworthy since you joined my crew. I've never caught you doing anything sketchy or shady. But FYI, the higher-ups aren't really feeling you, bro.' 7. So like, just chill and go back peacefully, ya know? Don't wanna tick off the Philistine bosses. Don't do anything sketchy in their eyes, fam. 8. And David was like, hold up, Achish, what did I do wrong? I've been loyal to you this whole time. Why can't I go and fight against my lord the king's enemies? 9. And Achish was like, dude, David, you're like totally righteous in my eyes, I mean, you're like an actual angel from God or something! But, you gotta know, the Philistine leaders are all like, nah, he can't join us in the battle. 10. So, like, get up really early in the morning with your master's squad that came with you. And once you're awake and it's bright outside, bounce. 11. So David and his squad woke up super early to bounce in the morning, heading back to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines rolled up to Jezreel. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 291. Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which {is} in Jezreel. 2. And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish. 3. Then said the princes of the Philistines, What {do} these Hebrews {here}? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, {Is} not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell {unto me} unto this day? 4. And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? {should it} not {be} with the heads of these men? 5. {Is} not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands? 6. Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, {as} the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host {is} good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not. {the lords...: Heb. thou art not good in the eyes of the lords} 7. Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines. {displease...: Heb. do not evil in the eyes of the lords} 8. And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king? {with...: Heb. before thee} 9. And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou {art} good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle. 10. Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart. 11. So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 301. So, like, David and his squad pulled up to Ziklag after three days, and guess what? Those Amalekites totally rolled in and wrecked the place. They straight up attacked Ziklag, set it on fire and left it in ruins. 2. And they captured the women there, but they didn't hurt anyone, whether they were important or not. They just took them and kept going. 3. So David and his squad pulled up to the city and, like, oh my gosh, it was totally torched! Plus, their wifey and kiddos got snatched up by the enemy. Such a major bummer, dude. 4. So David and his crew, they started bawling their eyes out, like they couldn't even cry anymore because they were so drained. 5. So like, David's two wives got captured, one was Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and the other was Abigail, who was Nabal the Carmelite's wife. 6. David was freaking out big time because everyone was talking about throwing rocks at him. They were super upset and heartbroken over their kids. But David lifted himself up and found strength in the Lord, his God. 7. So David was like, 'Yo Abiathar, you're Ahimelech's son right? Can you hook me up with the ephod?'. And Abiathar was all like, 'Sure thing bro', and brought the ephod to David. 8. So David hits up God and asks, like, 'Yo, should I chase after these guys? Can I catch up to them?' And God's like, 'Yeah, dude, go for it! You'll totally catch up to them and get everything back, no doubt.' 9. So David and his squad of six hundred homies rolled up to the brook called Besor, where the rest of the crew stayed back. 10. So David kept going, with him and his squad of four hundred bros. But like, two hundred of them were totally wiped, so they couldn't even cross that stream called Besor, bro. 11. So they stumbled upon this Egyptian dude chilling in the field, and they brought him to David. They hooked him up with some bread, and he totally chowed down. Oh, and they even gave him some water to wash it all down. 12. And they gave him a slice of fig cake, and two bunches of raisins. And after he had eaten, he felt alive again, 'cause he hadn't eaten any bread or drank any water for three whole days and nights. 13. David asked him, 'Who do you belong to and where are you from?' The young man replied, 'I'm an Egyptian dude, a servant of an Amalekite. My master ditched me because I've been sick for three days now.' 14. So, like, we totally came at the south side of those Cherethites, and also the coast that belongs to Judah, and the south side of Caleb. And yo, we straight up set Ziklag on fire, no joke. 15. David was like, 'Yo, can you help me take down this crew?' And the guy was like, 'Bro, swear on God that you won't murder me or hand me over to your boss, and I got you. I'll help you take 'em down.' 16. And when he finally brought him down, check it out, they were all over the place on the whole earth, grubbing on some food and drinks, and busting some moves, all because of the crazy amount of epic loot they scored from the Philistine territory and Judah! 17. So David totally wrecked them from dusk till dawn the next day, and not a single one got away except for these 400 dudes on camels who made a run for it. 18. And David totally got back everything that those Amalekites had taken away: and David saved his two wives. 19. And they didn't lack anything at all - not even the small stuff or the big stuff, not their sons or daughters, not their loot, or anything they had acquired. David got it all back. 20. So David grabbed all the flocks and herds and drove them alongside the other animals. He declared, 'This is David's loot.' 21. So David rolled up on about 200 dudes who were so exhausted they couldn't keep up with him. These dudes had been chillin' at the brook Besor. They decided to come out and greet David and his crew. When David got close, he gave them a friendly shoutout and asked how they were doing. 22. All the bad dudes and losers who were with David answered and said, 'Since those guys didn't roll with us, we ain't sharing any of the loot we got, except for their wives and kids. They can take them and bounce.' 23. And David was like, yo dudes, let's not go that route, my fam, with all the stuff that the Lord has blessed us with. He's protected us and straight up handed over our enemies to us. 24. Like, who's gonna listen to you about this? But, like, those who actually go into battle and those who stay back to guard the stuff, they both deserve a fair share of the spoils. 25. And like, from that day on, he totally made it a legit rule for all of Israel, even until now. Like, seriously, it's been a thing from then, you know? 26. So, when David arrived at Ziklag, he sent some of the loot to the older peeps of Judah, ya know, his homies. He was like, 'Yo, check it out, got a little gift for ya from the stuff we took from the enemies of the LORD, like a super blessed gift and all.' 27. To all the peeps in Bethel, and to those chilling in south Ramoth, and to the homies in Jattir, 28. And shoutout to the homies in Aroer, Siphmoth, and Eshtemoa, 29. And to the squad in Rachal, and to the homies in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to the fam in the cities of the Kenites, 30. And to those who were chillin' in Hormah, and to those who were vibin' in Chorashan, and to those who were kickin' it in Athach, 31. And to the squad in Hebron, and to all the spots where David and his crew used to chill. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 301. And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire; 2. And had taken the women captives, that {were} therein: they slew not any, either great or small, but carried {them} away, and went on their way. 3. So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, {it was} burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives. 4. Then David and the people that {were} with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep. 5. And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. 6. And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God. {grieved: Heb. bitter} 7. And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David. 8. And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him, Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake {them}, and without fail recover {all}. 9. So David went, he and the six hundred men that {were} with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed. 10. But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor. 11. And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water; 12. And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk {any} water, three days and three nights. 13. And David said unto him, To whom {belongest} thou? and whence {art} thou? And he said, I {am} a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick. 14. We made an invasion {upon} the south of the Cherethites, and upon {the coast} which {belongeth} to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire. 15. And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company. 16. And when he had brought him down, behold, {they were} spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah. 17. And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled. {the next...: Heb. their morrow} 18. And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away: and David rescued his two wives. 19. And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any {thing} that they had taken to them: David recovered all. 20. And David took all the flocks and the herds, {which} they drave before those {other} cattle, and said, This {is} David's spoil. 21. And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that {were} with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them. {saluted...: or, asked them how they did} 22. Then answered all the wicked men and {men} of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them {ought} of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead {them} away, and depart. {those: Heb. men} 23. Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand. 24. For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part {is} that goeth down to the battle, so {shall} his part {be} that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike. 25. And it was {so} from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day. {forward: Heb. and forward} 26. And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, {even} to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD; {present: Heb. blessing} 27. To {them} which {were} in Bethel, and to {them} which {were} in south Ramoth, and to {them} which {were} in Jattir, 28. And to {them} which {were} in Aroer, and to {them} which {were} in Siphmoth, and to {them} which {were} in Eshtemoa, 29. And to {them} which {were} in Rachal, and to {them} which {were} in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to {them} which {were} in the cities of the Kenites, 30. And to {them} which {were} in Hormah, and to {them} which {were} in Chorashan, and to {them} which {were} in Athach, 31. And to {them} which {were} in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Samuel 311. So, like, the Philistines were totally goin' at it with Israel, and the dudes from Israel panicked and, like, ran away from the Philistines, and ended up gettin' all wrecked on Mount Gilboa. {slain: or, wounded} 2. And the Philistines were right on Saul's tail, chasing after him and his sons. They managed to defeat Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, who were Saul's sons. 3. So Saul was having a tough time in the battle, and then the archers nailed him with their shots. He got seriously messed up by those archers, like, he was totally wounded. It was like, bam! Right on target. (BTW, archers = dudes with bows, just FYI) 4. So Saul told his homie with the weapons, yo, pull out your sword and stab me with it. I don't wanna get wrecked and made fun of by these uncircumcised fools. But his homie was too scared, so Saul just grabbed a sword himself and yeeted on it. 5. And when his bro saw that Saul was gone, he did the same thing and went out like a legend, falling upon his weapon and joining him in the afterlife. 6. So like, Saul, his three sons, his armorbearer, and all his men straight up died on that very day, all at once. 7. OMG, when the Israelite dudes on the other side of the valley and those across the Jordan River saw that the Israelite dudes were running away and that Saul and his sons were dead, they totally abandoned their cities and took off. Then the Philistines moved in and made themselves at home. 8. The next day, when the Philistines came to loot the dead bodies, they discovered that Saul and his three sons had been defeated on Mount Gilboa. 9. So, they totally chopped off his head, stripped off his epic armor, and like, sent it to all the Philistine peeps to flex over their idols and show off to everyone in town. 10. So they stored his armor in the house of Ashtaroth, and hung his body on the wall of Bethshan. 11. And when the people of Jabeshgilead found out what the Philistines did to Saul, it was like, woah, big news, you know? 12. So like, all these super brave dudes got up and hustled through the night to snatch Saul's body and his sons' bodies off the wall of Bethshan. They headed over to Jabesh and straight up burned them there. 13. And they grabbed their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and went on a total social media detox for a whole week. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Samuel 311. Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. {slain: or, wounded} 2. And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons. 3. And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers. {and the archers: Heb. and the shooters, men with bows} {hit...: Heb. found him} 4. Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. {abuse...: or, mock me} 5. And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him. 6. So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together. 7. And when the men of Israel that {were} on the other side of the valley, and {they} that {were} on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. 8. And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa. 9. And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish {it in} the house of their idols, and among the people. 10. And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan. 11. And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul; {of that: or, concerning him that} 12. All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. 13. And they took their bones, and buried {them} under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 11. So, like, after Saul died and David came back from whooping the Amalekites' butts, David chilled in Ziklag for a couple of days. 2. So, like, on the third day, this guy comes out of the camp, right? His clothes are all torn and he's got dirt on his head and stuff. And, boom, when he reaches David, he falls to the ground and shows mad respect. 3. So David was like, 'Yo, where'd you come from?' And the dude was like, 'Bro, I just escaped from the Israel camp.' 4. So David was like, dude, what went down? Seriously, spill the tea. And the guy's all like, bro, everyone ditched the fight, and a bunch of them got wrecked. Plus, Saul and Jonathan, his son, they're both gone too. Just like, dead. Yeah, it's messed up, man. 5. David was like, 'Yo, how do you even know for sure that Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead?' 6. So, this dude who saw it go down, was like, I randomly stumbled upon mount Gilboa, and guess what? Saul was leaning on his spear, and there were the mad chariots and horsemen chasing after him, yo! 7. And like, when he turned around, he spotted me and reached out to me. And I was like, yo, what's up? And I was all like, here I am, like totally ready to be there for you, you know? 8. And he was like, 'Yo, who you be?' And I was like, 'I'm an Amalekite.' 9. He was like, yo, come at me again and take me down, 'cause I'm feeling mad stressed out with this heaviness in my life that's just weighing me down. It's like my armor is holding me back, you know? 10. So, like, I totally went for it and took him down because I knew there was no way he could survive the fall. Then, I grabbed the crown off his head and the bracelet off his arm and I brought them here for my boss, ya know. 11. So David, like, literally grabbed his clothes and tore them apart, and all the other dudes with him were like, doing the same thing, you know: 12. And they were like super sad and cried a ton and didn't eat all day, you know, for Saul, and his son Jonathan, and the people who believed in God, and for all Israel, because they got killed in battle. 13. David asked the dude who gave him the scoop, 'Where do you come from?' And he replied, 'I'm from out of town, I'm an Amalekite.' 14. And David was like, dude, weren't you even scared to reach out and mess with someone who was chosen by the LORD? 15. So David grabbed one of his homies, and was like, 'Yo, get close to him and take him down.' And then he straight up knocked him out and killed him. 16. David was like, 'Bro, your actions are on you, 'cause you straight up confessed to killing the chosen one of the LORD with your mouth, man.' 17. So, like, David was filled with sadness and wrote this really deep lament about Saul and his son Jonathan: 18. He told them to teach the kids in Judah how to shoot bows—like, it's right there in the Jasher book. (Just so you know, 'Jasher' means 'upright' in case you were wondering.) 19. Dude, it's so heartbreaking! The cool peeps from Israel, they got crushed in the most prominent spots. It's like, why did the strong ones have to go down? It's a total bummer! 20. Don't even spill the tea in Gath, don't flex in the streets of Askelon. We don't want those Philistine girls getting too hyped, or the uncircumcised girls flexing too hard. 21. Yo, Gilboa mountains, no need for any dew or rain to fall on you. Don't expect any fields of offerings either. It's because over there, the shield of the mighty Saul was shamefully discarded, like it wasn't even anointed with oil. 22. The epic moves of Jonathan and Saul were unmatched - they never held back, leaving a trail of fallen foes and victorious battles. No arrow missed its mark, and no swing of the sword left unfinished business. 23. Saul and Jonathan were totally awesome and had the best vibes while they were alive. Even in death, they stayed tight and loyal to each other. They were faster than eagles and stronger than lions. Like, seriously impressive, man. #SquadGoals #Legends 24. Yo, Israelite girls, shed tears for Saul, the one who hooked you up with fire red outfits and other dope stuff, and decked you out with gold bling on your clothes. 25. OMG, the mighty ones totally got wrecked in the battle! Jonathan, dude, you got taken out while holding your ground at a high spot. 26. Dude, I'm really bummed out for you, my bro Jonathan. You've always been super cool to me, like seriously awesome. Your love for me has been next level, even stronger than any love from girls. 27. Yo, the strong ones have totally bit the dust and their weapons of war? They're straight up gone! \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 11. Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag; 2. It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and {so} it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance. 3. And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. 4. And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. {How...: Heb. What was, etc} 5. And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? 6. And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. 7. And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here {am} I. {Here...: Heb. Behold me} 8. And he said unto me, Who {art} thou? And I answered him, I {am} an Amalekite. 9. He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life {is} yet whole in me. {anguish...: or, my coat of mail (or, my embroidered coat) hindereth me, that my, etc} 10. So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that {was} upon his head, and the bracelet that {was} on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord. 11. Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that {were} with him: 12. And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. 13. And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence {art} thou? And he answered, I {am} the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. 14. And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed? 15. And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, {and} fall upon him. And he smote him that he died. 16. And David said unto him, Thy blood {be} upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed. 17. And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: 18. (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah {the use of} the bow: behold, {it is} written in the book of Jasher.) {of Jasher: or, of the upright} 19. The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! 20. Tell {it} not in Gath, publish {it} not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. 21. Ye mountains of Gilboa, {let there be} no dew, neither {let there be} rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, {as though he had} not {been} anointed with oil. 22. From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. 23. Saul and Jonathan {were} lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. {pleasant: or, sweet} 24. Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with {other} delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. 25. How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, {thou wast} slain in thine high places. 26. I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. 27. How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 21. So, like, David was all like, 'Yo, LORD, should I like, go to any of the cities in Judah?' And the LORD was all like, 'Yeah, dude, go for it.' Then David was like, 'Cool, but, um, where should I go?' And the LORD was like, 'Hebron, my dude.' 2. So David went up there, and his two wives were with him, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, who was married to Nabal the Carmelite dude. 3. David brought all his homies with him and they flexed to Hebron, where they set up shop in different cities, along with their fams. 4. So, the dudes from Judah rolled up and they totally crowned David as the king of Judah. And they hit up David, like, yo, it was the dudes from Jabeshgilead who took care of Saul's burial. 5. So David like DM-ed the guys from Jabeshgilead and was like, yo, you guys are totally blessed by the LORD for being so cool to your lord, Saul, and giving him a proper burial. 6. And now may the LORD bless you with kindness and honesty: and I will also repay you for your kindness, because you did this thing. 7. So like, it's time to step up, be strong, and show some courage! 'Cause Saul, your leader, is no more, and the people of Judah have chosen me as their king. Be like, the sons and daughters of bravery, you know? 8. So Abner, Saul's main man, grabbed Ishbosheth, Saul's son, and took him to Mahanaim. (BTW, Ishbosheth's other name is Eshbaal.) 9. And gave him the crown to rule Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all of Israel. 10. Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was, like, forty years old when he started being the boss of Israel and reigned for two years. But the homies in Judah were all about David. 11. So, like, David was totally ruling in Hebron for, like, seven years and six months, you know? It was, like, a pretty long time n' all. {time: BTW, Hebrew peeps count it in days} 12. So Abner, Ner's kid, and the squad of Ishbosheth (the son of Saul) left Mahanaim and rolled up to Gibeon. 13. So Joab, Zeruiah's son, and David's crew all dipped out and linked up at the Gibeon hot spot. They parked themselves on opposite ends of the pool, just chillin'. 14. Abner was like, 'Yo Joab, tell the squad to get up and entertain us.' And Joab was all like, 'Yeah, let them get up.' 15. So, like, twelve dudes from Benjamin joined Ishbosheth, Saul's son, and twelve other homies from David's squad. 16. And they like totally grabbed each other by the head, and like stabbed their swords into each other's sides; and they literally fell down together: 'cause of that, the place was named Helkathhazzurim, which is like, in Gibeon. Helkathhazzurim means, like, The field of strong dudes or something. 17. So, like, there was this intense battle that went down that day, and Abner got totally wrecked along with the whole Israel crew, before David's squad took over. 18. So there were these three dudes, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel, who were the sons of Zeruiah. And let me tell you, Asahel was like super fast, I'm talking Usain Bolt level speed. Like a wild deer running through the field, this guy was a total speed demon on his feet. 19. And Asahel was totally after Abner, not slowing down or getting distracted at all. He stayed right on Abner's tail, no zigzagging or taking detours. #FocusedGoals 20. Abner turned around and asked, 'Are you Asahel?' And he replied, 'Yep, that's me.' 21. And Abner was like, 'Yo, go to the right or left and grab one of the young dudes and snatch their gear.' But Asahel was like, 'Nah, I ain't drifting apart from chasing this dude.' 22. And Abner was like, dude, Asahel, chillax and stop following me, man. Why do I gotta hurt you and humiliate myself in front of your bro Joab? 23. But he totally didn't want to back down, so Abner straight up hit him with the back end of his spear right in the side, like really hard. The spear went clean through him and came out the other side. He just straight up died right then and there. And it's crazy, but everyone who saw Asahel fall down and die just froze in their tracks, man. 24. Joab and Abishai were chasing after Abner. They kept going until the sun went down and they reached the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the wildnerness of Gibeon. 25. So, like, the peeps from Benjamin got together and formed, like, this big squad after Abner. They all chilled on top of a hill, totally united. 26. So Abner hits up Joab and is like, 'Bro, do we gotta just keep killin' each other? Don't you realize it's gonna bring hella bitterness in the long run? How much longer do we gotta wait before you tell our peeps to stop chasing after their own fam?' 27. Joab was like, 'I swear to God, if you hadn't said anything, everyone would have split up in the morning and gone their own way.' 28. Then Joab pulled out his phone and played a sick beat, and everyone just froze and stopped chasing after Israel. They were like, nah, no more fighting. 29. So Abner and his squad decided to march all night long across the plain, crossed over the Jordan River, and trekked through Bithron like bosses. Finally, they arrived at their destination, Mahanaim. 30. So Joab came back after chasing Abner and realized that nineteen of David's men, including Asahel, were missing. 31. But David's followers fought against Benjamin and Abner's men, and three hundred and sixty men were killed. 32. So they picked up Asahel and laid him to rest in his father's tomb in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his crew traveled all night and arrived in Hebron by daybreak. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 21. And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron. 2. So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite. 3. And his men that {were} with him did David bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron. 4. And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, {That} the men of Jabeshgilead {were they} that buried Saul. 5. And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed {be} ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, {even} unto Saul, and have buried him. 6. And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. 7. Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them. {be ye...: Heb. be ye the sons of valour} 8. But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim; {Saul's host: Heb. the host which was Saul's} {Ishbosheth: or, Eshbaal} 9. And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel. 10. Ishbosheth Saul's son {was} forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. 11. And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. {time: Heb. number of days} 12. And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 13. And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. {together: Heb. them together} 14. And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. 15. Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which {pertained} to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 16. And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and {thrust} his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which {is} in Gibeon. {Helkathhazzurim: that is, The field of strong men} 17. And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David. 18. And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel {was as} light of foot as a wild roe. {of foot: Heb. of his feet} {as a wild...: Heb. as one of the roes that is in the field} 19. And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. {from...: Heb. from after Abner} 20. Then Abner looked behind him, and said, {Art} thou Asahel? And he answered, I {am}. 21. And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him. {armour: or, spoil} 22. And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother? 23. Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth {rib}, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, {that} as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still. 24. Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that {lieth} before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. 25. And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill. 26. Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren? 27. And Joab said, {As} God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother. {in the...: Heb. from the morning} {gone...: or, gone away} 28. So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more. 29. And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim. 30. And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's servants nineteen men and Asahel. 31. But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, {so that} three hundred and threescore men died. 32. And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which {was in} Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 31. There was, like, this really intense war going on for a while between Saul's fam and David's fam. But David kept leveling up and getting stronger, while Saul's fam just started losing power and getting weaker. 2. David had some kids while he was chilling in Hebron: his oldest, Amnon, was born to Ahinoam the Jezreelitess. 3. Also, he had another son named Chileab, who was born to Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. And his third son was Absalom, born to Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, the king of Geshur. 4. Next up, we've got the fourth dude, Adonijah, who's Haggith's son. And coming in at number five, we have Shephatiah, Abital's son. Just keeping you updated! 5. And the sixth one, Ithream, was born to David and Eglah, David's wife. They were born when David was in Hebron. 6. While there was this intense beef going on between the squad of Saul and the squad of David, Abner was totally flexing and boosting Saul's squad. 7. So Saul had a side piece named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ishbosheth straight up asked Abner, 'Why'd you go hooking up with my dad's side chick?' 8. Abner got super angry when Ishbosheth said that! He was like, am I some worthless dog, being nice to Judah's peeps, the family and homies of Saul your father, and not handing you over to David? And now you're blaming me for this lady situation? Seriously? 9. May God deal with Abner likewise, and even more, unless He fulfills His covenant with David; in which case, I will treat him accordingly. 10. To switch up the ruling fam from Saul to David, and to make David the king of all Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba. 11. And he, like, couldn't even say anything back to Abner because he was, like, so scared of him. 12. Abner reached out to David, sending messengers to represent him. He asked, 'Who does this land belong to?' He also proposed, 'Let's make a pact, and you can count on me to rally all of Israel to your side.' 13. So the guy was like, alright cool, let's make a pact. But there's just one condition, you can't see my face unless you bring me Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see me. (That's what he meant by 'saying' in Hebrew.) 14. So David hit up Ishbosheth, Saul's son, with a message like yo, send me back my girl Michal, you know the one I earned by bringing in a hundred Philistine foreskins. 15. So Ishbosheth DM'ed her and swiped her away from her husband, Phaltiel (aka Phalti). 16. And her husband, like, went with her, totally weeping and walking behind her, all the way to Bahurim. Then Abner was like, dude, go back. So he turned around and went back. 17. So Abner talked to the OGs of Israel, like, yo, remember when y'all wanted David to be your king? Yeah, it was like just the other day and the day before that too, straight up. 18. Listen up, fam! The big man upstairs, God, has straight up told us that through David, His servant, He's gonna save His people, Israel, from those wicked Philistines and all their haters. It's gonna go down, no doubt! 19. So Abner was like, talking to Benjamin about some stuff, and then he like went over to Hebron to talk to David. He was telling them all the stuff that seemed cool to Israel and the whole house of Benjamin. 20. So Abner pulled up at David's crib in Hebron, rollin' deep with twenty of his homies. And David threw down a sick feast for Abner and his crew. 21. Abner straight up told David that he's gonna gather all of Israel to support him and make a dope alliance, so that David can reign over everything he's ever wanted. David was like, 'Alright, Abner, go do your thing' and peace out, no drama. 22. So, like, guess what? David and Joab's squad was rollin' back from chasing after some enemies, and they came back with a sick amount of loot. But, yo, Abner wasn't with David in Hebron 'cause he sent him away, and Abner left on good terms 'n stuff. 23. When Joab and all his squad pulled up, they were like, yo Joab, check it, Abner, son of Ner, rolled up to the king and the king let him go unharmed, peace out. 24. So Joab went up to the king and was like, 'Bro, what's up with you? Abner came to you and you just let him go? Like, why did you let him leave?' 25. Yo, you know Abner, Ner's son? He straight up came to trick you, peep all your moves, and be all up in your business, you know what I'm sayin'? He tryna know every single thing you be doin'. 26. So Joab leaves David and sends a bunch of messages to Abner, who they bring back from the well of Sirah. But David had no clue about any of it. 27. So when Abner came back to Hebron, Joab pulled him aside at the gate for a hushed conversation, and suddenly attacked him, stabbing him fatally in the ribs, as a revenge for the death of his brother Asahel. 28. And when David found out about it, he was like, 'Yo, me and my kingdom are totally innocent, like, forever, when it comes to Abner's death. We didn't shed no blood or nothing, man. Blood, you know, like literal blood.' 29. Make sure Joab and his family bear the consequences. No one from Joab's household should escape the consequences of illness, be it physical or financial. Let there be no one who suffers from chronic conditions, infectious diseases, disabilities, self-harm, or poverty. 30. Joab and Abishai straight up took out Abner because he had killed their bro Asahel at Gibeon during the epic battle. 31. So, David told Joab and everyone else who was with him, 'Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and show some deep mourning for Abner.' And guess what? King David himself walked behind the funeral stretch. (FYI, a 'bier' is like a fancy bed) 32. So they laid Abner to rest in Hebron. And the king spoke up, tears streaming down his face as he stood by Abner's grave. And everyone there couldn't help but shed tears too. 33. And the king was like, so sad about Abner, and he was like, did Abner die like, in a dumb way? 34. Your hands weren't tied, and your feet weren't put in chains, just like when someone falls in front of bad dudes, the same thing happened to you. And everyone started crying over you again. 35. And when everyone came to offer David some food while it was still daytime, David made a promise, saying, 'I swear to God, and even more, that I won't have any bread or anything else to eat until the sun sets.' 36. And everyone paid attention to it, and they thought it was cool: whatever the king did, everyone liked it. (liked it: Hebrew - was good in their eyes) 37. Everybody, like, totally got it that day, both the peeps and all of Israel, that it was, like, not cool for the king to straight-up kill Abner, Ner's son. 38. Yo, did y'all not know that a total legend just bit the dust today in Israel? The king is straight up mourning over it! 39. Yo, today I feeling kinda weak even though I'm the anointed king. These dudes, the sons of Zeruiah, they're way too tough for me. But ya know what? The Lord gonna make sure that whoever does evil gets what they deserve, based on how wicked they are. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 31. Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker. 2. And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; 3. And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur; {Chileab: or, Daniel} 4. And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital; 5. And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron. 6. And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul. 7. And Saul had a concubine, whose name {was} Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and {Ishbosheth} said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my father's concubine? 8. Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, {Am} I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman? 9. So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath sworn to David, even so I do to him; 10. To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba. 11. And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him. 12. And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose {is} the land? saying {also}, Make thy league with me, and, behold, my hand {shall be} with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee. 13. And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face. {that is: Heb. saying} 14. And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying, Deliver {me} my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines. 15. And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from {her} husband, {even} from Phaltiel the son of Laish. {Phaltiel: also called, Phalti} 16. And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he returned. {along...: Heb. going and weeping} 17. And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past {to be} king over you: {in times...: Heb. both yesterday and the third day} 18. Now then do {it}: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies. 19. And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin. 20. So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that {were} with him a feast. 21. And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace. 22. And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from {pursuing} a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner {was} not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace. 23. When Joab and all the host that {was} with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace. 24. Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came unto thee; why {is} it {that} thou hast sent him away, and he is quite gone? 25. Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all that thou doest. 26. And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew {it} not. 27. And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth {rib}, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother. {quietly: or, peaceably} 28. And afterward when David heard {it}, he said, I and my kingdom {are} guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner: {blood: Heb. bloods} 29. Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread. {fail: Heb. be cut off} 30. So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle. 31. And David said to Joab, and to all the people that {were} with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David {himself} followed the bier. {bier: Heb. bed} 32. And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept. 33. And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dieth? 34. Thy hands {were} not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, {so} fellest thou. And all the people wept again over him. {wicked...: Heb. children of iniquity} 35. And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down. 36. And all the people took notice {of it}, and it pleased them: as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people. {pleased them: Heb. was good in their eyes} 37. For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner. 38. And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel? 39. And I {am} this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah {be} too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness. {weak: Heb. tender} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 41. Dude, when Saul's son found out that Abner bit the dust in Hebron, he was totally bummed out, and all the Israelites were freaking out. 2. Saul's son had two absolute bosses in his squad: one was named Baanah, and the other was Rechab. They were like the elite warriors from Benjamin, called Rimmon a Beerothite. Beeroth was a part of Benjamin's crew too! 3. And the Beerothites, like, totally dipped to Gittaim and crashed there until now, you know what I'm sayin'? 4. Yo, check it. Saul's son Jonathan had this son who had a leg injury, like couldn't walk properly. This kiddo was only five when news came about Saul and Jonathan's defeat in Jezreel. In a rush to escape, his nanny scooped him up and they booked it. But unfortunately, the little dude fell and messed up his leg real bad. They ended up calling him Mephibosheth or Meribbaal. 5. So like, Rechab and Baanah, these dudes from Rimmon the Beerothite, they went to Ishbosheth's crib when it was mad hot during the day, and Ishbosheth was straight up chillin' in bed at noon. 6. So they went into the house like they were going to get some food, and they attacked him unexpectedly; hitting him right in the gut. Rechab and his brother Baanah managed to get away. 7. So, when they entered the crib, this dude was chilling on his bed, and they straight-up attacked him, killed him, snatched his head, and got away through the open field, lowkey journeying through the darkness all night long. 8. So they brought Ishbosheth's head to David in Hebron, and they're like, 'Yo, King! Check out Ishbosheth, your enemy Saul's son! He wanted you dead, but today the LORD made sure you're avenged against Saul and his fam.' 9. And David replied to Rechab and Baanah, the bros of Rimmon from Beeroth, and said to them, I swear by the LORD, who has saved my soul from every tough situation, 10. So someone came and told me, like, 'Yo, Saul is dead!' and they actually thought they were bringing me good news. But instead of being grateful, I straight up killed the messenger in Ziklag. Can you believe that? Dude really thought I was gonna give him a reward for his little message. Like, no way, man. He got exactly what he deserved. 11. Like, seriously, think about it – when these evil dudes go and straight up murder an innocent person in their own house, on their bed and all. Like, don't you think I gotta hold these guys accountable for their messed up actions? And, I mean, won't I totally have to deal with you too, and, like, remove you from this world for real? 12. So David told his crew to take care of business. With no mercy, they defeated their enemies, taking their hands, feet, and leaving their bodies hanging over the pool in Hebron. And as for Ishbosheth, they respectfully laid his head to rest in Abner's tomb, also in Hebron. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 41. And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled. 2. And Saul's son had two men {that were} captains of bands: the name of the one {was} Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin: {other: Heb. second} 3. And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.) 4. And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son {that was} lame of {his} feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name {was} Mephibosheth. {Mephibosheth: or, Meribbaal} 5. And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon. 6. And they came thither into the midst of the house, {as though} they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth {rib}: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped. 7. For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain all night. 8. And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron, and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed. 9. And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, {As} the LORD liveth, who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity, 10. When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who {thought} that I would have given him a reward for his tidings: {thinking...: Heb. he was in his own eyes as a bringer, etc} {who...: or, which was the reward I gave him for his tidings} 11. How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? 12. And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged {them} up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and buried {it} in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 51. So all the squads of Israel gathered to David in Hebron and said, like, check it out, bro, we're, like, totally your fam and kin. 2. Back in the day, when Saul was ruling the show, you were the one in charge, guiding and leading Israel. The big man upstairs told you, 'You'll take care of my people, Israel, and be their top chief.' 3. So, like, all the OGs of Israel pulled up to the king in Hebron, and King David was like, 'Let's make a pact, fam,' and they all agreed in Hebron before the LORD. And they crowned David as the king of Israel, ya feel me? 4. David was, like, totally thirty years old when he took over as king and, like, ruled for a solid forty years. 5. In Hebron, he was in charge of Judah for, like, 7 years and 6 months. Then in Jerusalem, he ruled over all Israel and Judah for a solid 33 years. 6. So the king and his squad pulled up to Jerusalem to face the Jebusites, the locals of the land. They straight up told David, 'Yo, if you don't get rid of your squad of blind and disabled peeps, you ain't coming in here.' They actually thought David couldn't handle this place. (Like, duh!) 7. But David totally conquered the awesome fortress of Zion, which is legit the city where David himself lived. 8. So, David was like, yo, whoever can climb up to this ledge and defeat the Jebusites, even if they're lame or blind and I can't stand them, they'll become the boss. That's why people said, no way blind and lame peeps can come inside the crib. 9. So David chillaxed in the fort and named it the city of David. And David straight up built all around from Millo and into the heart of the city. 10. And David just kept vibing, like, seriously leveling up, and the LORD God of hosts was straight up squad goals, side by side with him. #goals #blessed 11. So Hiram, the king of Tyre, hit up David with some DMs, and sent over a bunch of cedar trees, skilled carpenters, and stone-cutting pros, to help build David a dope crib. #HustleHard #HomeSweetHome 12. And David was like, 'Yo, God totally made me king over Israel, and He's all about elevating His kingdom for the sake of us, His people, ya know. 13. And David, like, added more concubines and wives to his crew from Jerusalem, right after he rolled in from Hebron. And, yo, there were still more sons and daughters poppin' out like, 'What up, David?' 14. So, like, these are the names of the kids that were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon. 15. There's also Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, and Japhia, yo! 16. And like, Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphalet. 17. When the Philistines found out that David had been crowned king of Israel, they all came looking for him. David caught wind of it and headed down to the hideout. 18. Yo, the Philistines pulled up in the valley of Rephaim. 19. So David asked the LORD, 'Should I take on the Philistines? Will you let me defeat them?' And the LORD answered David, 'Go for it! I'll totally make sure you win against the Philistines.' 20. So, David went to Baalperazim and totally defeated them there. He was like, 'Yo, God is totally crushing my enemies, just like a huge flood sweeping in.' That's why he named the place Baalperazim, which means the plain of breaches. 21. So they got rid of their old pics and David and his squad straight up burned them. {burned...: or, took them away} 22. And the Philistines showed up once more, spreading out in the valley of Rephaim. 23. So, like, when David asked the LORD, He was like, 'Nah, dude, don't go up there. Instead, circle around behind them and ambush them near the mulberry trees.' 24. Yo, when you hear the sound of movement in the tops of those mulberry trees, that's the sign to get moving. 'Cause that's when the LORD is gonna go ahead of you and straight up wreck those Philistines. 25. And David totally nailed it, just as the LORD told him to, and totally wrecked the Philistines from Geba all the way to Gazer. (Geba is also known as Gibeon, BTW.) \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 51. Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we {are} thy bone and thy flesh. 2. Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel. 3. So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel. 4. David {was} thirty years old when he began to reign, {and} he reigned forty years. 5. In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah. 6. And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither. {thinking...: or, saying David shall not, etc} 7. Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same {is} the city of David. 8. And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, {that are} hated of David's soul, {he shall be chief and captain}. Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house. {Wherefore...: or, Because they had said, even the blind and the lame, He shall not} 9. So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward. 10. And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts {was} with him. {went...: Heb. went, going and growing} 11. And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house. {masons: Heb. hewers of the stone of the wall} 12. And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake. 13. And David took {him} more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David. 14. And these {be} the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, 15. Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 16. And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet. 17. But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard {of it}, and went down to the hold. 18. The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 19. And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand. 20. And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim. {Baalperazim: that is, the plain of breaches} 21. And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them. {burned...: or, took them away} 22. And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 23. And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go up; {but} fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. 24. And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines. 25. And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer. {Geba: also called, Gibeon} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 61. Once again, David rounded up all the elite squad of Israel, a whopping thirty thousand strong. 2. So David got up and went with his crew from Baale of Judah to bring the ark of God from there. This ark is called by the name of the LORD of hosts, who chills between the cherubims. (Baale is also known as Baalah or Kirjathjearim) 3. So they put God's ark on a brand-new ride and took it out from Abinadab's crib in Gibeah. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab's boys, were the ones cruising the fresh wheels. 4. So they took it out of Abinadab's crib in Gibeah, you know, bringing along the God box and Ahio leading the way with it. 5. So, David and all the cool peeps of Israel jammed out for the LORD using all sorts of sick instruments made of fir wood. They were slaying it on harps, psalteries, timbrels, cornets, and cymbals, no cap. 6. So, when they arrived at Nachon's spot where they were tossing the grain, Uzzah reached out and touched the sacred chest, because the oxen were causing it to wobble. Nachon, who was also known as Chidon, was the owner of that place. The oxen stumbled, causing the chest to shake. 7. God got really mad at Uzzah and totally struck him down because of a mistake he made. Uzzah straight up died right there by the ark of God. (And by mistake, I mean he acted without thinking, you feel?) 8. And David was really upset, y'know, because the LORD caused this whole thing to go down with Uzzah, and he decided to name the place Perezuzzah from that day on. Perezuzzah, bruh, like, it's where Uzzah made that big mistake and everything fell apart, you feel me? 9. And David was shooketh by the Lord that day, and he was like, OMG how can the ark of the Lord come to me? 10. David was like, nah, I'm not moving the ark of the LORD to the city of David. Instead, he took it to stay at Obededom the Gittite's crib. 11. So, the LORD's ark chilled at Obededom the Gittite's crib for three months, and you won't believe it, but God straight-up blessed Obededom and his whole fam. No cap! 12. Yo, guess what? King David heard that Obededom's crib got straight up blessed by the LORD, all 'cause of that God's ark situation. So David was like, 'No cap, I'm bringing that ark to the city of David with mad joy.' 13. So, like, here's what happened: when the peeps carrying the ark of the LORD took just six steps, they totally offered up some boss oxen and fatlings as a sacrifice. 14. So, like, David was totally lit AF as he danced his heart out before the LORD. He was rocking this sick linen ephod outfit. It was so epic. 15. So David and all the squad of Israel hyped up the ark of the LORD with mad shouts and epic trumpet beats. 16. When the sacred ark of the LORD rolled into David's turf, Michal, Saul's daughter, peeped through a window and caught sight of king David busting some sick moves and breaking it down for the LORD. But deep inside, she couldn't stand the sight of him. 17. So they brought in the ark of the LORD and placed it in its spot within the awesome tent that David set up for it. And David made some lit burnt offerings and peace offerings as a way of showing love and respect to the LORD. 18. After David finished making his burnt offerings and peace offerings, he gave a shoutout to the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. 19. And he gave food to everyone, both men and women, in the midst of the whole crowd of Israel. Each person received a delicious loaf of bread, a generous serving of meat, and a bottle of wine. So all the people went back to their own homes. 20. After that, David went back to his crib, ready to flex on his squad. Suddenly, Michal, Saul's daughter, came out to confront David and straight up roasted him. She was like, 'Dude, what a move to show off in front of all those basic handmaids! You basically flashed them shamelessly, just like those attention-seeking losers!' 21. So David was like, 'Yo, Michal, I was straight up doing this for the Lord. He picked me over your dad and his whole fam to be the ruler of His peeps in Israel. That's why I was just vibin' and playing in front of the Lord.' 22. And I will totally embrace my true self, no holds barred. I'll even lower my own self-esteem just to show you I'm serious. And those maids you mentioned earlier? They're gonna give me mad respect, believe it or not. 23. So, Michal, Saul's daughter, couldn't have any kids until the day she passed away. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 61. Again, David gathered together all {the} chosen {men} of Israel, thirty thousand. 2. And David arose, and went with all the people that {were} with him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts that dwelleth {between} the cherubims. {Baale: or, Baalah, that is, Kirjathjearim} {whose name...: or, at which the name, even the name of the LORD of hosts, was called upon} 3. And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that {was} in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart. {set: Heb. made to ride} {Gibeah: or, the hill} 4. And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which {was} at Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the ark. {accompanying: Heb. with} 5. And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of {instruments made of} fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals. 6. And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth {his hand} to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook {it}. {Nachon: also called Chidon} {shook it: or, stumbled} 7. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for {his} error; and there he died by the ark of God. {error: or, rashness} 8. And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to this day. {made: Heb. broken} {Perezuzzah: that is, the breach of Uzzah} 9. And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall the ark of the LORD come to me? 10. So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. 11. And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all his household. 12. And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the house of Obededom, and all that {pertaineth} unto him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obededom into the city of David with gladness. 13. And it was {so}, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings. 14. And David danced before the LORD with all {his} might; and David {was} girded with a linen ephod. 15. So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet. 16. And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart. 17. And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. {pitched: Heb. stretched} 18. And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts. 19. And he dealt among all the people, {even} among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece {of flesh}, and a flagon {of wine}. So all the people departed every one to his house. 20. Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! {shamelessly: or, openly} 21. And David said unto Michal, {It was} before the LORD, which chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD. 22. And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour. {of the...: or, of the handmaids of my servants} 23. Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 71. And it happened, when the king was chilling in his crib, and the LORD had totally hooked him up, giving him peace from all his haters; 2. So, like, the king was talking to Nathan the prophet, and he's all like, 'Listen up, bro! I've got this cool crib made of cedar, but the ark of God is just chillin' behind some curtains, ya know?' 3. And Nathan was like, yo king, go ahead and do whatever you're feeling in your heart 'cause, guess what, the LORD is totally vibing with you. 4. So, like, one night, God spoke to Nathan, saying, 5. Hey, go and tell my guy David something. The LORD says, are you gonna build me a crib for me to chill in? 6. Yo, I haven't been chillin' in any crib ever since I freed the Israel fam from Egypt, up until now. I've been rollin' with a tent and a tabernacle vibe. 7. Yo, in all the places I've been hangin' with the whole squad of Israel, I never said a single word to any of the tribes of Israel that I commanded to take care of my peeps, like, why y'all not buildin' me a dope cedar crib? 8. So here's the message for my dude David: The big man upstairs, the mighty LORD, says I plucked you out of that sheep gig and made you the boss of my peeps, over in Israel. {from following: That means I snatched you up after you were all about them sheep} 9. And I was totally on your side wherever you went, obliterating all your haters from your view and giving you a legit reputation, on par with the big shots in the world. That's right, they couldn't even stand in your presence. 10. And I'm gonna set up a sick spot for my peeps, the Israelites, and I'll totally plant them there. They'll have their own chill place to live, no more movin' around. And those haters won't mess with them anymore, like they did back in the day. 11. Ever since I appointed judges to rule over my squad, the people of Israel, and granted you sweet relief from all your haters, the LORD wants you to know that he's gonna hook you up with a dope crib. 12. And like, when you're old and stuff and you pass away, I'll make sure your descendants take over. They'll come from like, your own bloodline and I'll totally make sure his kingdom is, like, legit. 13. He's gonna build a sick crib in my name, and I'll make sure his kingdom reigns forever, fam. 14. I'll be his dad and he'll be my son. If he messes up, I'll give him a reality check and teach him some tough lessons. 15. But I promise to always show him love and kindness, just like I did with Saul before you. 16. And your crib and your squad will be lit for all eternity: your throne gonna be hella established forever. 17. So like, Nathan was all straight up telling David about everything he said and everything he saw. 18. So, like, King David entered and, like, sat in front of the LORD, and he was all like, 'Um, who am I, Lord GOD? And, like, what's the deal with my house? How come you, like, brought me this far?' 19. And like, this was no biggie at all to you, O Lord GOD; but you also talked about my servant's crib for, like, a really long time in the future. And, like, is this how things usually go for humans, O Lord GOD? 20. And like, what else can David even say to you, God? 'Cause, like, you already know me inside out! 21. You did all these awesome things for me to know about, because of your word and what's in your heart. 22. Dude, you're literally the coolest, O LORD God. Like, there's seriously no one else like you, and no other God can even come close. We've heard all these amazing things about you through the grapevine. 23. Yo, no nation on this earth can even come close to being as lit as your people, Israel. God straight up chose y'all and redeemed you, making you his own special crew. He's all about making a name for you and doing some epic and mind-blowing stuff for you and your land, like way better than anything you've ever seen before. Remember how he saved you from Egypt and all those other nations? Yeah, those gods they worshipped got nothing on your God. 24. You totally locked it in that your squad, Israel, is gonna be your peeps forever. And you, LORD, straight up became their God. 25. And now, yo God, the talk you had about me and my fam, make it happen for real and do what you said. 26. So, like, make your name, like, totally awesome forever by, like, saying that the LORD of hosts is, like, the ultimate God over Israel, and, like, may your servant David's family, you know, thrive forever in your presence. 27. Yo, God, the ultimate boss and the God of Israel, you straight up told your servant that you're gonna build them a house. So, your servant is genuinely feeling it and has this prayer in their heart to talk to you about it. 28. And yo, O Lord GOD, you're like, the ultimate God, and your words are legit, like, super true, and you've totally promised this awesome goodness to your servant: 29.

      "KJV: 2 Samuel 71. And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies; 2. That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains. 3. And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that {is} in thine heart; for the LORD {is} with thee. 4. And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying, 5. Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in? {my servant...: Heb. to my servant, to David} 6. Whereas I have not dwelt in {any} house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle. 7. In all {the places} wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar? {any of...: any of the judges} 8. Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel: {from following: Heb. from after} 9. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great {men} that {are} in the earth. {out of...: Heb. from thy face} 10. Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime, 11. And as since the time that I commanded judges {to be} over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house. 12. And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. 13. He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. 14. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: 15. But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took {it} from Saul, whom I put away before thee. 16. And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever. 17. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 18. Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who {am} I, O Lord GOD? and what {is} my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 19. And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And {is} this the manner of man, O Lord GOD? {manner: Heb. law} 20. And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant. 21. For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know {them}. 22. Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for {there is} none like thee, neither {is there any} God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 23. And what one nation in the earth {is} like thy people, {even} like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, {from} the nations and their gods? 24. For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel {to be} a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God. 25. And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish {it} for ever, and do as thou hast said. 26. And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts {is} the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee. 27. For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee. {revealed: Heb. opened the ear} 28. And now, O Lord GOD, thou {art} that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 29. Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken {it}: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever. {let it...: Heb. be thou pleased and bless} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 81. So, like, David totally owned the Philistines and got them under his control. He snatched Methegammah, which is like the bridle of Ammah, from the Philistines. 2. So, like, he totally defeated Moab and stuff, right? He used this measuring line thing to measure them and brought them down to the ground. With two lines, he was like, 'dead' and with one full line, he was like, 'alive'. And dude, those Moabites ended up becoming David's servants and they brought him all these cool gifts. 3. David totally owned Hadadezer, son of Rehob, the king of Zobah, when he flexed on him at the river Euphrates to reclaim his territory. (Hadadezer, also known as Hadarezer) 4. So David took a thousand dope chariots, along with seven hundred sick horsemen and twenty thousand lit foot soldiers. And David totally wrecked all the chariot horses, but he kept a hundred chariots for himself. #QueenStatus 5. So, when the Syrians from Damascus tried to help out Hadadezer, who was the king of Zobah, David totally wiped out twenty-two thousand of them! 6. So, David set up some squads in Syria, specifically in Damascus, and the Syrians basically became David's loyal peeps. They were all like, 'Here, have some gifts!' And you know what? The LORD totally had David's back wherever he went. 7. So, David grabbed those sick gold shields that the servants of Hadadezer were flexing with and flexed back by bringing them all the way to Jerusalem. 8. King David grabbed a ton of bronze from Betah and Berothai, two cities of Hadadezer. 9. When King Toi from Hamath found out that David totally wrecked Hadadezer's army, 10. So Toi's son, Joram, slid into King David's DMs to say hi and give him mad props for conquering Hadadezer. Hadadezer and Toi were in a serious feud. Joram brought along some sick gifts like silver, gold, and brass bling. (btw, Joram was also called Hadoram) 11. King David flexed on the LORD by dedicating mad cash, including all the bling he acquired from conquering other nations. 🙌 12. So, like, Syria, Moab, Ammon, Philistines, Amalek, and the stuff they took from Hadadezer, Rehob's son, yo, he was the king of Zobah. 13. David got super famous when he came back after totally wrecking the Syrians in the valley of salt. He took down a massive army of eighteen thousand strong. Epic victory, right? 14. So, like, David put his squad in Edom. He stationed them all over Edom, and everyone from Edom became David's crew. And, yo, the LORD had David's back no matter where he went. 15. So David was, like, the ruler of all Israel, and he made sure to dish out some serious judgement and fairness to all his peeps. 16. And Joab, Zeruiah's kid, was in charge of the crew; and Jehoshaphat, Ahilud's child, was the chronicler. 17. So, like, Zadok, Ahitub's kid, and Ahimelech, Abiathar's son, were the priests, and Seraiah was the scribe, you know, like the secretary dude. 18. And Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, had authority over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were like the top-notch leaders. (top-notch leaders: or, super cool rulers) \n",

David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates. {Hadadezer: or, Hadarezer} 4.

And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 8.

      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 91. So David's like, yo, any of Saul's fam still around? I wanna do something nice for Jonathan's sake, ya know? 2. There was this dude named Ziba, who happened to be a servant from the house of Saul. When David called him, the king was like, 'Yo, are you Ziba?' And he was like, 'Yeah, I'm your servant!' 3. So the king was like, 'Yo, is there still anyone from Saul's fam around? I wanna show God's kindness to them.' And Ziba was like, 'Yeah, bro, Jonathan's got a son but he's got a bit of a disability — lame on his feet.' 4. The king was like, 'Yo, where's he at?' And Ziba was all like, 'Yo, check it, he's chillin' at Machir's crib, son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.' 5. So King David hit up this dude named Machir, Ammiel's son, who was chilling in Lodebar, and brought him over. 6. So, when Mephibosheth, who was Jonathan's son and Saul's grandson, arrived before David, he totally bowed down and showed respect. Then David called out to Mephibosheth, who replied, 'Here I am, your loyal servant!' (By the way, Mephibosheth was also known as Meribbaal.) 7. And David was like, yo, don't even trip! I'mma totally hook you up because of the tight bond I had with your pops, Jonathan. You gonna get all the land that belonged to Saul, your old man. And guess what? You gonna be dining at my table all day, every day. No cap. 8. And he totally humbled himself and was like, yo, why should you even bother noticing someone as worthless as me, like some dead animal? 9. The king hit up Ziba, who was Saul's servant, and straight up told him, 'Yo, I hooked your master's son up with everything that belonged to Saul and his whole fam.' 10. So, you and your squad, and your peeps, gotta work the land for him, and make sure you bring in the goods, so that your master's offspring can chow down. But Mephibosheth, your master's kid, is gonna have a constant spot at my table. By the way, Ziba had a whole crew of fifteen sons and twenty servants. 11. So Ziba was like, 'Yo king, I'm totally gonna do whatever you want me to do, just like a good servant.' And the king was like, 'Mephibosheth? Yeah, he's gonna have a seat at my table, just like one of my own kids.' 12. And Mephibosheth had a cool kid named Micha. And all the peeps living at Ziba's place were straight-up servants for Mephibosheth. 13. So Mephibosheth stayed in Jerusalem and totally scored a permanent spot at the king's table, even though he couldn't walk 'cos he had a lame condition in both of his feet. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 91. And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake? 2. And {there was} of the house of Saul a servant whose name {was} Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, {Art} thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant {is he}. 3. And the king said, {Is} there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, {which is} lame on {his} feet. 4. And the king said unto him, Where {is} he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he {is} in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar. 5. Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar. 6. Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy servant! {Mephibosheth: also called Meribbaal} 7. And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually. 8. And he bowed himself, and said, What {is} thy servant, that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I {am}? 9. Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house. 10. Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in {the fruits}, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 11. Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do. As for Mephibosheth, {said the king}, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons. 12. And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name {was} Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba {were} servants unto Mephibosheth. 13. So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 101. And then, the king of the children of Ammon passed away, and his son Hanun took over as king. 2. So David was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna be nice to Hanun, Nahash's son, since his dad was nice to me. And he sent his homies to cheer him up and show sympathy because of his dad. And those homies of David went straight into Ammonite territory, no cap. 3. Yo, Hanun, the dudes from Ammon were like, do you really think David is showing respect to your pops by sending his boys to comfort you? Nah man, David actually sent his servants to scout out the city and wreck it. Do you really think David would do that in your eyes? 4. So Hanun decided to mess with David's crew, and totally shaved off half of their beards, and cut their clothes right down the middle, like all the way to their butts, and then sent them packing. 5. When they told David about it, he DM'd them, cause the guys were mad embarrassed. And the king was like, stay at Jericho until your facial hair game is on point, and then come back. 6. So, like, when the Ammonites realized that they were totally losing to David, they were like, 'Oh snap, we need some backup.' So they hired these Syrians from Bethrehob and Zoba. They got, like, 20,000 foot soldiers from there, and also a thousand dudes from king Maacah, plus another twelve thousand dudes from Ishtob. (By the way, Ishtob means the men from Tob, in case you were wondering.) 7. When David found out about {it}, he texted Joab and all the squad of his most powerful warriors. 8. So, the Ammonites showed up and prepared for battle at the gate. Meanwhile, the Syrians from Zoba, Rehob, Ishtob, and Maacah were chilling in the field, doing their own thing. 9. So, like, when Joab peeped that he was totally getting attacked from every direction, he rounded up the absolute best peeps from Israel and got them all ready to battle those Syrians, you know? 10. And he handed over the remaining people to his brother Abishai, so that they could form a formation against the kids from Ammon. 11. He was like, if the Syrians are too OP for me, then you gotta help me out. But if the children of Ammon are too OP for you, then I got your back, fam. 12. Let's stay strong and reprez our squad for our peeps and our cities that are blessed by God. Trust that the big man upstairs will handle it all, and do what He knows best. 13. So Joab and his squad rolled up to the battlefield, ready to take on the Syrians. And guess what? The Syrians freaked out and made a run for it, 'cause they knew who they were messing with. 14. And like, when the peeps from Ammon peeped that the Syrians were dip-dipping, they also hightailed it away from Abishai and went into the city. So Joab hit reverse from the peeps in Ammon and rolled back to Jerusalem. 15. And when the Syrians peeped that they got clapped by Israel, they all linked up together. 16. So Hadarezer called his people from Syria on the other side of the river and they all gathered at a place called Helam. Shobach, who was the leader of Hadarezer's army, led them. (By the way, 'the river' here means the Euphrates River and 'Shobach' can also be spelled 'Shophach'.) 17. So David heard the news, and he called all of his homies in Israel to link up. They crossed the Jordan River and rolled up to Helam. The Syrians saw David coming and were ready to throw down in a straight-up battle. 18. So the Syrians were totally wrecked by Israel, and David straight up defeated 700 Syrian chariots, 40k horse riders, and took down Shobach, their captain. He totally died there, man. (And by horse riders, I mean foot soldiers too, just fyi) 19. And like, all the kings who were, like, working for Hadarezer saw that they got totally wrecked by Israel, so they were like, 'Okay, let's make peace with Israel and become their servants.' And then the Syrians were, like, scared to help the Ammonite children anymore. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 101. And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead. 2. Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon. 3. And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David {rather} sent his servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it? {Thinkest...: Heb. In thine eyes doth David} 4. Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, {even} to their buttocks, and sent them away. 5. When they told {it} unto David, he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and {then} return. 6. And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men. {Ishtob: or, the men of Tob} 7. And when David heard of {it}, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 8. And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba, and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, {were} by themselves in the field. 9. When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice {men} of Israel, and put {them} in array against the Syrians: 10. And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of Abishai his brother, that he might put {them} in array against the children of Ammon. 11. And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee. 12. Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which seemeth him good. 13. And Joab drew nigh, and the people that {were} with him, unto the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him. 14. And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem. 15. And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together. 16. And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that {were} beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer {went} before them. {the river: that is, Euphrates} {Shobach: or, Shophach} 17. And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together, and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him. 18. And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew {the men of} seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there. {horsemen: also called, footmen} 19. And when all the kings {that were} servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 111. So, like, when the year was done and kings usually go out to fight their battles, David sent Joab and his crew and all of Israel. They totally wiped out the Ammonites and laid siege to Rabbah. But David stayed back in Jerusalem. 2. So, like, one evening David gets up from his bed and decides to chill on the roof of the king's crib. And while he's up there, he spots this gorgeous woman taking a bath. Seriously, she was stunning. 3. So David slid into the DMs and was like, 'Yo, who's that fine lady?' And someone was like, 'Bro, that's Bathsheba, Eliam's daughter and Uriah the Hittite's wife, you know?' 4. So David sent some texts and hooked up with her; she came over and they did the thing. She had already gone through the whole cleansing process, so it was all good. Then she went back home. {or, once she had purified herself, etc, she went back} 5. So, like, this woman got pregnant and she texted David and was like, 'Hey dude, guess what? I'm preggers!' 6. So David slid into Joab's DMs like, 'Yo bro, send me Uriah the Hittite.' And Joab was like, 'Bet, I'll hook you up.' Then Joab sent Uriah right to David's crib. 7. When Uriah arrived, David asked him about Joab, the people, and how the war was going. (This means David wanted to know how Joab was doing, how the people were, and how successful the war had been.) 8. So David told Uriah, yo, head back home and freshen up. Uriah bounced from the king's crib, and the king hooked him up with a dope spread on the way out. 9. But Uriah crashed at the king's crib with all his crew, and didn't bounce to his own pad. 10. So, like, when they told David that Uriah didn't even go home, David was all like, 'Hey, Uriah, didn't you just come back from your trip? So why didn't you go home, man?'} 11. So Uriah was like, 'Yo David, the Ark, Israel, and Judah are all chillin' in tents while Joab and his peeps are out in the open fields. You think I'ma go home and Netflix & chill with my wife while they out here grindin'? Nah man, I swear on my life, I'm not gonna do that. 12. And David was like, 'Yo Uriah, chill here today and tomorrow I'll let you dip. So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem for that day and the next. 13. And like, David was all 'Yo dude, come eat and chill with me,' and they totally grubbed together. And David went all out and got him super wasted. Then at night, he bounced to crash on his bed with the other servants of his lord, but he didn't go to his own crib, you know? 14. So, the next morning, David decided to slide into Joab's DMs and sent a letter with Uriah as the messenger. 15. Yo, he wrote in the letter, like, put Uriah in the most intense battle, and then step back so he gets hit and dies. 16. So, like, Joab checked out the city and he sent Uriah to a spot where he knew there were some seriously brave dudes. 17. So, like, the dudes from the town came out and started a fight with Joab. And, yeah, some of David's crew got taken down, including Uriah the Hittite who bit the dust. 18. So Joab hit up David with all the deets about the war. 19. And the messenger was like, yo listen up, when you're done spilling the tea about the war to the king, 20. And if the king gets mad and asks you, like, why did you come so close to the city when you were fighting? Didn't you know they would shoot at you from the wall? 21. Yo, who took out Abimelech, son of Jerubbesheth? Wasn't it a lady who straight up yeeted a chunk of a millstone at him from the wall, causing him to bite the dust in Thebez? And why were y'all even going near the wall, man? Tell Bathsheba that her man Uriah the Hittite is also deceased. (Jerubbesheth, btw, is also known as Jerubbaal.) 22. So the messenger went and told David everything that Joab had sent him about. 23. And the messenger was like, 'Yo, David, no cap, those dudes straight up wrecked us! They came at us in the field, and we were on them hard until we reached the gate, fam. 24. And those shooters totally went off, blasting your loyal peeps from the wall. It's messed up, man! Some of the king's crew got taken out, including Uriah the Hittite, one of your own. 25. Yo, David told the messenger, here's what you gotta say to Joab. Don't get all bent out of shape about this, man, 'cause in war everyone's at risk. Step up your game and take down that city with all your strength. Give Joab some words of encouragement, yo. 26. So like, when Uriah's wife found out that Uriah, her husband, had died, she was seriously devastated and mourned for him big time. 27. After the time of sorrow, David brought her to his crib, and they became husband and wife, and she gave birth to a son. But what David did was not cool with the LORD. {displeased: Hebrew: was evil in the eyes of} \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 111. And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth {to battle}, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem. {after...: Heb. at the return of the year, or, in the spring} 2. And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman {was} very beautiful to look upon. 3. And David sent and enquired after the woman. And {one} said, {Is} not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite? {Bathsheba: or, Bathshuah} {Eliam: or Ammiel} 4. And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her uncleanness: and she returned unto her house. {for she...: or, and when she had purified herself, etc, she returned} 5. And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I {am} with child. 6. And David sent to Joab, {saying}, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David. 7. And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded {of him} how Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered. {how Joab...: Heb. of the peace of, etc} 8. And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there followed him a mess {of meat} from the king. {followed...: Heb. went out after him} 9. But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house. 10. And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from {thy} journey? why {then} didst thou not go down unto thine house? 11. And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? {as} thou livest, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing. 12. And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the morrow. 13. And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to his house. 14. And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent {it} by the hand of Uriah. 15. And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that he may be smitten, and die. {hottest: Heb. strong} {from him: Heb. from after him} 16. And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men {were}. 17. And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell {some} of the people of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also. 18. Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war; 19. And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king, 20. And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall? 21. Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. {Jerubbesheth: also called, Jerubbaal} 22. So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab had sent him for. 23. And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate. 24. And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and {some} of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also. 25. Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him. {displease...: Heb. be evil in thine eyes} {one...: Heb. so and such} 26. And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband. 27. And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD. {displeased: Heb. was evil in the eyes of} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 121. So, like, God was all, 'Yo, Nathan, go talk to David.' And Nathan was like, 'Sure thing.' So he goes and meets up with David, and he's like, 'Listen up, bro. There were these two dudes who lived in the same city. One was super loaded, and the other was barely scraping by, you know?' 2. The rich dude had, like, sooo many flocks and herds: 3. But this one poor guy had, like, nothing, except for this one tiny pet lamb that he had bought and raised. And they grew up together, like, as best buds with him and his kids. It would eat from his plate, drink from his cup, snuggle up in his lap, and was, like, basically a part of the fam. 4. So this dude shows up at this rich guy's place, and the rich dude had more than enough animals of his own to cook for his guest. But instead of using his own, he takes the poor guy's precious lamb and cooks it up for the guest without even asking. Like, seriously? Not cool, bro. 5. David was super pissed at the dude and he said to Nathan, 'I swear on the Lord's name, the guy who did this deserves to die for sure.' 6. And he gotta pay back the lamb four times, 'cause he pulled that move and didn't show any mercy. 7. And Nathan was like, bro, it's you. This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: I chose you to be king over Israel, and I saved you from Saul's grip. 8. And I hooked you up with your master's crib, and your master's girls, and I even gave you the whole Israel and Judah crib; and yo, if that wasn't enough, I would've given you even more dope stuff. 9. Yo, why'd you diss the Lord's command and do something wicked in His eyes? You straight up murdered Uriah the Hittite and stole his wifey to make her your own. And to top it off, you killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. 10. So, like, listen up, from now on there will always be drama in your fam, cuz you dissed me and scooped up Uriah the Hittite's wifey as your own. Not cool, dude. 11. Yo, listen up! The LORD says, check it out, I'm gonna bring some serious trouble your way, right from within your own family. And get this, I'm gonna snatch your wives right in front of you and give them to your neighbor, and he's gonna be getting cozy with them right under the sun's watchful eye. 12. You were on the down-low with that move, but I'm about to flex this thing in front of all Israel, and even the sun will witness it. 13. David was like, 'Yo, Nathan, I messed up big time. I totally sinned against the LORD.' And Nathan was all like, 'Don't stress, dude. The LORD forgives you and won't punish you with death.' 14. But, yo, because you just totally gave those enemies of the LORD a legit reason to talk smack, your child that's gonna be born is gonna die for real. 15. So Nathan went back home. And, like, God made the baby that Uriah's wife had with David really, really sick, man. 16. So David hit up God for the child, and David decided to go on a serious fasting binge. He stayed up all night, sleeping on the ground like a boss. #dedication #prayinghard 17. Then the older peeps in his crib got up and came to him, tryna help him off the ground. But he straight up refused, and didn't even munch on some bread with them. 18. So on the seventh day, the child passed away. David's crew was scared to break the news to him because while the child was still alive, we talked to him but he ignored us. We thought, if he reacted like that back then, imagine how upset he'll be if we tell him the child is dead? 19. But when David peeped that his squad was gossipin', David knew that the child had passed away. So David asked his squad, 'Yo, is the child gone?' And they were like, 'Yeah, he's gone, bro.' 20. So David stood up, cleaned up, freshened up, changed his clothes, and went to the house of the LORD to worship. After that, he went back to his own crib and when he asked for it, they served him some grub, and he chowed down. 21. Yo, his squad said to him, 'Dude, what's up with this? You were fasting and crying for the kid when they were alive, but now that they're dead, you're up and eating food.' 22. And he was like, when the kid was still alive, I was totally going through it, fasting and crying and stuff. 'Cause I was thinking, like, who knows if GOD will show me some love and make the kid survive, you know? 23. But like, he's gone now, so why should I even bother fasting? Can I like, bring him back? Nah, man. I'm gonna go to him one day, but he can't come back to me. 24. So David was there for Bathsheba, his wife, and they got intimate and had a baby boy. They named him Solomon, and you know what? The LORD totally loved him. 25. So, like, God used Nathan the prophet to send a message and He gave him the name Jedidiah, which means like, beloved of the LORD, you know? 26. So, Joab went up against Rabbah, which belonged to the Ammonites, and managed to conquer their capital city. 27. So Joab DM'ed David like, 'Yo dude, just wanna let you know I totally wrecked Rabbah in battle and we finally captured the city with all its water resources. 28. So, like, gather the rest of the squad and set up camp right outside the city. The goal is to take it over, ya know? I mean, I can't have the city not being known under my name, right? Gotta leave my mark, fam. #CityConquest 29. So, like, David gathered all his squad, and they rolled up to Rabbah, ready to throw hands and conquer it. 30. And he snatched the king's crown right off his head, made out of a whopping chunk of pure gold adorned with stunning gemstones, and he placed it on David's head. Then he paraded around with all the loot he took from the city, a total treasure trove of epic proportions. Like, seriously, it was a crazy amount. 31. And he like, brought out all the people from there and made them go through these seriously intense tools like saws and iron harrows and iron axes, and even made them pass through a brickkiln, and he did this to all the cities of the Ammonite peeps. So David and the whole crew went back to Jerusalem. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 121. And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor. 2. The rich {man} had exceeding many flocks and herds: 3. But the poor {man} had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. {meat: Heb. morsel} 4. And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him. 5. And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, {As} the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this {thing} shall surely die: {shall...: or, is worthy to die, or, is a son of death} 6. And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. 7. And Nathan said to David, Thou {art} the man. Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; 8. And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if {that had been} too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such things. 9. Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife {to be} thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon. 10. Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife. 11. Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and give {them} unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun. 12. For thou didst {it} secretly: but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun. 13. And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt not die. 14. Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also {that is} born unto thee shall surely die. 15. And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick. 16. David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night upon the earth. {fasted: Heb. fasted a fast} 17. And the elders of his house arose, {and went} to him, to raise him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them. 18. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead? {vex: Heb. do hurt} 19. But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead. 20. Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed {himself}, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat. 21. Then said his servants unto him, What thing {is} this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, {while it was} alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread. 22. And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell {whether} GOD will be gracious to me, that the child may live? 23. But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me. 24. And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her, and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him. 25. And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD. {Jedidiah: that is, Beloved of the LORD} 26. And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and took the royal city. 27. And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters. 28. Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name. {it be called...: Heb. my name be called upon it} 29. And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it. 30. And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof {was} a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was {set} on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance. {in great...: Heb. very great} 31. And he brought forth the people that {were} therein, and put {them} under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made them pass through the brickkiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 131. So, like, after this happened, there was this guy named Absalom, who was David's son and, like, he had a really gorgeous sister named Tamar. And then there's this other dude, Amnon, who was also David's son, and he was totally in love with Tamar. 2. Amnon was seriously upset because he had a major crush on his sister Tamar. She was still a virgin, and Amnon believed it was totally impossible to make a move on her. It was like an unfathomable challenge for him. 3. But Amnon had this homie named Jonadab, who was Shimeah David's bro, and let me tell you, Jonadab was hella smart. 4. And he was like, dude, why are you, being the king's son, losing weight day after day? Can't you spill the tea to me? And Amnon was like, bro, I'm totally into Tamar, my bro Absalom's sis. Like, every single day I feel this way. 5. And Jonadab was like, dude, just lie down on your bed and act sick. When your dad comes to check on you, ask him if my sis Tamar can come and bring me some food. Make sure she prepares the food right in front of me, so I can see it and eat it from her hands. 6. So Amnon was like, totally feeling down and sick, right? And when the king came to check on him, Amnon was all like, 'Yo Dad, can you ask Tamar, my sis, to come over and make me some bomb cakes? I want to eat them while she's making them.' 7. So David DM'd Tamar, like, 'Hey, go over to your bro Amnon's crib and whip up some grub for him.' 8. So Tamar went over to her brother Amnon's crib, and he was chilling. And she grabbed some flour, and started kneading it to make some lit cakes in front of him, and then she baked 'em. (Flour: or, paste) 9. So, she brought a plate and served it in front of him, but he rejected it. Then Amnon cleared the room, commanding everyone to leave. 10. Amnon was like, 'Hey Tamar, bring me that food so I can chow down.' So Tamar took the cakes she made and brought them to Amnon in his room. 11. After she presented the food to him, he grabbed her and said, 'Come chill with me, sis, let's share a bed.' 12. And she was like, um no, bro, don't even think about it. This kind of stuff is not cool in Israel. Please don't act foolishly like this. 13. And I, like, where should I even hide my embarrassment? And as for you, you'll be seen as one of those clueless people in Israel. So like, seriously, please talk to the king, 'cause he won't keep me away from you. 14. But he didn't listen to her, even though he had more power, so he basically forced her and slept with her. 15. Amnon was, like, super annoyed with her, to the point that his annoyance towards her was even stronger than the love he used to feel for her. And Amnon was all like, 'Yo, get up and leave.' 16. And she's like, there's literally no reason for this: the way you're treating me now is even worse than what you did before. But he totally ignores her and won't listen. 17. So, he hit up his servant who had been helping him out and was like, 'Yo, kick this girl out of here ASAP and make sure you lock the door behind her.' 18. And she was wearing a super cool outfit with lots of different colors: the kind of clothes that the king's daughters who were still single would wear. Then the servant let her out and locked the door behind her. 19. So Tamar, like, put ashes on her head and tore her super stylish multicolored garment that she was wearing. She, like, placed her hand on her head and just started crying, like, really loudly. 20. And Absalom, Tamar's brother, was like, 'Has Amnon, your brother, been with you?' But chill out, sis, he's your brother, so don't even stress about it. So Tamar stayed alone at her bro Absalom's crib. 💔 21. But when King David found out about all this, he was seriously pissed off. 22. So Absalom didn't say anything good or bad to his brother Amnon, because he hated Amnon for what he did to their sister Tamar. 23. So, like, after waiting for, you know, a legit two whole years, Absalom decided to throw this epic party at Baalhazor, like, near Ephraim and everything. And get this, he invited all the sons of the king. 24. So Absalom went up to the king and said, 'Yo, peep this, my dude! Your servant's got some mad sheepshearers. It would be pretty lit if you and your homies could roll with us.' 25. And the king was like, 'Nah, dude, let's not all go right now. It might be too expensive for you, you know?' But Absalom was persistent, man, like, he really wanted to go. But in the end, he didn't go and the king gave him his blessings. 26. Absalom was like, 'Hey bro, if my brother Amnon can't roll with us, let's make it happen. But yo, the king was all like, 'Why does he need to come along?' 27. But Absalom kept insisting that he take Amnon and all the king's sons with him. 28. So Absalom told his homies, listen up, wait for Amnon to get all lit and drunk, and when I give you the signal, straight up smack him, don't be scared. I'm the boss here, so be brave and show your strength. You got this, my fellow warriors! 29. And Absalom's followers did what Absalom told them to do to Amnon. Then all the king's sons got up on their fancy rides and took off. {rode: Hebrew, rode} 30. So, like, while they were on the way, David got some news, and it's, like, heavy stuff, bruh. They were like, 'Yo, Absalom straight up killed all of the king's sons, man, not a single one of them survived.' 31. So, the king got up, ripped his outfit, and just flopped on the ground. And all of his squad were there, rocking ripped clothes too. 32. Yo, Jonadab, bro of Shimeah, David's fam, stepped up and was like, 'Hold up, my homie! Don't think all the young dudes, the king's sons, got offed. It was just Amnon who bit the dust. Absalom had it planned since the day he messed with his sister Tamar, you feel me? It was all set in stone, man.' 33. Yo, King, don't stress out and think all the king's sons are gone. It's just Amnon who bit the dust. 34. So Absalom basically dipped out. And this dude who was on guard duty looked up and saw a whole bunch of people coming down the hillside from behind. 35. Yo, King, check it out, the king's sons have arrived, just like your boy Jonadab predicted. He totally called it, man! 36. And right after he finished speaking, guess what? The king's sons came and started crying their hearts out, and guess what? The king and all of his servants were crying like crazy too. They were all in tears, big time! 37. But Absalom dipped, and slid into Talmai's DMs, the son of Ammihud, ruling the Geshur squad. And {David} legit grieved for his homie every single day. {Ammihud: or, Ammihur} 38. Then Absalom dipped, and dipped to Geshur, and chilled there for like three years. 39. King David really wanted to see Absalom, because he felt a little better now that Amnon was out of the picture. #familydrama \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 131. And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name {was} Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her. 2. And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister Tamar; for she {was} a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him to do any thing to her. {Amnon thought...: Heb. it was marvellous, or, hidden in the eyes of Amnon} 3. But Amnon had a friend, whose name {was} Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab {was} a very subtil man. 4. And he said unto him, Why {art} thou, {being} the king's son, lean from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister. {lean: Heb. thin} {from day...: Heb. morning by morning} 5. And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see {it}, and eat {it} at her hand. 6. So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand. 7. Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon's house, and dress him meat. 8. So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid down. And she took flour, and kneaded {it}, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes. {flour: or, paste} 9. And she took a pan, and poured {them} out before him; but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And they went out every man from him. 10. And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber, that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought {them} into the chamber to Amnon her brother. 11. And when she had brought {them} unto him to eat, he took hold of her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister. 12. And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly. {force...: Heb. humble me} {no such...: Heb. it ought not so to be done} 13. And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me from thee. 14. Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her. 15. Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith he hated her {was} greater than the love wherewith he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone. {exceedingly: Heb. with great hatred greatly} 16. And she said unto him, {There is} no cause: this evil in sending me away {is} greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her. 17. Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said, Put now this {woman} out from me, and bolt the door after her. 18. And {she had} a garment of divers colours upon her: for with such robes were the king's daughters {that were} virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her. 19. And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of divers colours that {was} on her, and laid her hand on her head, and went on crying. 20. And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he {is} thy brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house. {Amnon: Heb. Aminon} {regard...: Heb. set not thy heart} {desolate: Heb. and desolate} 21. But when king David heard of all these things, he was very wroth. 22. And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar. 23. And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which {is} beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king's sons. 24. And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his servants go with thy servant. 25. And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not go, but blessed him. 26. Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee? 27. But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him. 28. Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant. {have...: or, will you not, since I have commanded you?} {valiant: Heb. sons of valour} 29. And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat him up upon his mule, and fled. {gat...: Heb. rode} 30. And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons, and there is not one of them left. 31. Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent. 32. And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose {that} they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar. {appointment: Heb. mouth} {determined: or, settled} 33. Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon only is dead. 34. But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him. 35. And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come: as thy servant said, so it is. {as thy...: Heb. according to the word of thy servant} 36. And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore. {very...: Heb. with a great weeping greatly} 37. But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And {David} mourned for his son every day. {Ammihud: or, Ammihur} 38. So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years. 39. And {the soul of} king David longed to go forth unto Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead. {longed: or, was consumed} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 141. So Joab, Zeruiah's son, peeped that the king was totally vibing with Absalom. 2. So Joab got in touch with someone from Tekoah who was known to be wise. He asked her to pretend to be a grieving woman, and told her to dress in mourning clothes and not use any oil on herself, making it seem like she had been mourning for a long time. 3. And like, go to the king and, you know, talk to him like this. So Joab fed her the right words to say. 4. So, like, when this woman from Tekoah approached the king, she totally fell on her face to the ground and showed respect, and was like, 'Yo, help me out, O king.' {Help: Hebrew for Save} 5. Then the king asked her, 'What's wrong?' And she replied, 'OMG, I'm, like, literally a widow now, because my husband passed away.' 6. So, like, this woman, right? She had two sons, and these two dudes were straight up beefing in the field. And, yo, there was nobody around to break it up, so one of ’em went and straight up hit the other guy real hard and, like, killed him. No one was there to stop the drama, you know what I'm saying? 7. Yo, listen up. So, check it out, the whole fam is turning against your girl here. They straight up said, Handd over the dude who hit his bro, so we can straight up murk him for takin' a life.' And not only that, they wanna wipe out the heir too. If they do that, my fire will be totally gone, and there won't be a trace of my man left on this earth. For real, fam, it's like they wanna erase him from existence, man. 8. And the king was like, 'Yo, lady, go back home and I'll take care of everything for you.' 9. The woman from Tekoah told the king, 'Yo, my dude, the blame should be on me and my fam, not you and your rule.' 10. And the king was like, anyone who tries anything with you, just bring them to me and they won't bother you again. 11. Then she said, please, King, remember the LORD your God, so that you would prevent any more bloodshed. Don't let the avengers take any more lives, or else they might harm my son. And the king promised, I swear by the LORD's name, not a single hair of your son will be harmed. We won't let the avengers cause more destruction 12. So this girl was like, 'Hey, can I like, say something to you, oh mighty king?' And he was all like, 'Sure, go ahead, spill the tea.' 13. And the woman was like, dude, why would you even think of doing this terrible thing to God's people? The king is totally acting like he messed up here, 'cause he hasn't brought back his exiled peeps. 14. We all gotta die, fam, and it's like when you spill water on the ground - you can't reverse it, you know? God doesn't play favorites or show favoritism. But He's got a plan to make sure nobody who's been kicked out of His presence stays away forever. Like, He's got it all figured out, you feel me? 15. So, like, I gotta tell my lord the king something, 'cause the people totally scared me. Your girl here was like, 'I'm gonna speak to the king now, maybe he'll do what I ask. 16. The king's got my back, he'll save me and my son from the evil one who wants to ruin our rightful place in God's plan. 17. And then I was like, yo king, your words are super lit! You're like an angel from God, knowing what's good and what's whack. So the Lord your God's got your back, fam. 18. Yo, king dude, don't keep no secrets from me, you feel me? Ask me whatever you wanna know. And the woman said, Go ahead and spill, my king. 19. The king was like, 'Isn't Joab involved in all of this?' And the woman was like, 'I swear, my lord the king, no one can go against a word you say, because Joab told me to say all this.' 20. Your boy Joab did this thing to bring up this topic of conversation, and my lord is hella wise, like an angel of God, knowing everything that's going on in the world. 21. So the king was like, 'Yo Joab, check it, I just pulled this move. Now, go and bring back that homie Absalom.' 22. And Joab straight up dropped to the ground, face planted, and respectfully bowed down to show his gratitude to the king. Joab said, 'Today I fully realize that I'm totally in your good books, my lord, O king, because you totally came through and granted your servant's request.' 23. So Joab was like, 'I'm out,' and went to Geshur to find Absalom and bring him back to Jerusalem. 24. And the king was like, 'Go back to your crib, don't even bother lookin' at me.' So Absalom went back to his place, never laid eyes on the king. 25. But among all of Israel, no one was as praised as Absalom for his good looks. Seriously, this dude was flawless from head to toe, not a single imperfection. People couldn't help but admire him, trust me. 26. And like, at the end of each year, he would totally trim his hair, 'cause it was getting too heavy, you know? So he trimmed it, and it ended up weighing 200 shekels. That's like, the official king's weight and all. 27. Absalom had three sons and one daughter named Tamar who was really good-looking. 28. Absalom stayed in Jerusalem for a solid two years, but never got to hang with the king. 29. So Absalom hit up Joab, asking him to link up with the king, but Joab was like nah, not feeling it. And when Absalom hit him up a second time, Joab still wasn't down. 30. So he told his homies, yo, check it - Joab's plot is right next to mine, and dude's got hella barley there. Bet, go ahead and light that thing up. And Absalom's squad went and straight torched Joab's field. 31. So Joab gets up and goes to Absalom's crib and asks him, 'Yo, why did your homies burn down my turf?' 32. Absalom replied to Joab, like dude, I texted you to come over here so that I could send you to the king and be like, 'Yo, why did I even come back from Geshur? It was so chill over there.' So now let me see the king and if there's any wrong I've done, I'm ready to face the consequences, man. 33. Then Joab went to the king and told him. And when the king summoned Absalom, he appeared before the king, humbly bowing down before him. The king then embraced and kissed Absalom. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 141. Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart {was} toward Absalom. 2. And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead: 3. And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth. 4. And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O king. {Help: Heb. Save} 5. And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I {am} indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead. 6. And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in the field, and {there was} none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him. {none...: Heb. no deliverer between them} 7. And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband {neither} name nor remainder upon the earth. {upon...: Heb. upon the face of the earth} 8. And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I will give charge concerning thee. 9. And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity {be} on me, and on my father's house: and the king and his throne {be} guiltless. 10. And the king said, Whosoever saith {ought} unto thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more. 11. Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, {As} the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth. {that...: Heb. that the revenger of blood do not multiply to destroy} 12. Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak {one} word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on. 13. And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished. 14. For we must needs die, and {are} as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect {any} person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him. {neither...: or, because God hath not taken away his life, he hath also devised means, etc} 15. Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, {it is} because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid. 16. For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man {that would} destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God. 17. Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so {is} my lord the king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will be with thee. {comfortable: Heb. for rest} {to discern: Heb. to hear} 18. Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak. 19. And the king said, {Is not} the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, {As} thy soul liveth, my lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid: 20. To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done this thing: and my lord {is} wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know all {things} that {are} in the earth. 21. And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again. 22. And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself, and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant. {thanked: Heb. blessed} {his servant: or, thy servant} 23. So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 24. And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw not the king's face. 25. But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. {But...: Heb. And as Absalom there was not a beautiful man in all Israel to praise greatly} 26. And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled {it}: because {the hair} was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight. 27. And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter, whose name {was} Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance. 28. So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face. 29. Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the second time, he would not come. 30. Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom's servants set the field on fire. {near...: Heb. near my place} 31. Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto {his} house, and said unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire? 32. And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? {it had been} good for me {to have been} there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be {any} iniquity in me, let him kill me. 33. So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed Absalom. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 151. And then, like, after all that went down, Absalom totally got himself some sick rides and horses, and he had, like, a squad of fifty dudes to flex and run ahead of him. 2. So Absalom woke up early and positioned himself by the gate. Whenever someone came to the king with a dispute, Absalom would call out to them and ask where they were from. They would reply, saying they were from one of the Israelite tribes. 3. And Absalom was like, yo dude, I hear ya, your stuff is legit and valid; but it's whack that no one from the king's crew is here to listen to you. Like, nobody is giving you the time of day, from the top down. 4. Absalom was like, yo, I wish I could be the judge of the whole land and be there for everyone who needs help and give them the justice they deserve, you know? 5. So, like, whenever someone approached him to show respect, he reached out his hand, pulled them close, and gave them a friendly kiss. 6. So this is how Absalom played all of Israel who came seeking judgment from the king: he totally won over the hearts of the people. 7. After like forty years, Absalom was all like, 'Yo, King! Can I dip and fulfill this promise I made to the LORD in Hebron? 8. When I was chilling in Geshur, Syria, I made a big promise. I was like, yo, if God brings me back to Jerusalem, then I'm totally gonna serve Him. 9. And the king was like, 'You can go in peace, my dude.' So the guy got up and headed to Hebron. 10. So Absalom, being a total secret agent, sent his crew to scope out all the tribes of Israel. He instructed them, like, 'Once you catch wind of that trumpet sound, make sure you spread the word that Absalom is taking over in Hebron.' 11. And Absalom took along two hundred dudes from Jerusalem, who were pretty clueless and didn't know what was going on. 12. So Absalom hit up Ahithophel, David's main advisor, from his hometown Giloh, right when he was making sacrifices. And damn, the conspiracy grew stronger 'cause Absalom was gaining more and more followers. 13. Yo, someone hit up David with a message. They're like, 'Bruh, all the homies in Israel are totally team Absalom.' 14. So David said to all his homies in Jerusalem, Yo, let's bounce! We gotta dip ASAP 'cause Absalom's on our tail. Hurry up and dip before he catches us off guard and wreaks havoc on us, straight up slashing the city with his sword. No cap. 15. And the king's peeps were like, 'Yo king, we're down to do whatever you want, just let us know!' 16. So the king was like, 'Let's do this!' and everyone in his crew tagged along. But he had like ten side chicks, you know, concubines, to take care of the crib. They stayed back and held it down. #priorities 17. So the king dipped, and everyone followed him, chilling in a lit spot that was hella far away. 18. And all his squad rolled up with him; the whole squad, including the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and the Gittites - a crew of six hundred dudes who came from Gath - they all rolled out in front of the king. 19. The king was like, 'Yo, Ittai the Gittite, why are you rolling with us? Go back to your spot and chill with the king, man. 'Cause you're a foreigner, and also an exile.' 20. Dude, you just arrived yesterday. Am I seriously supposed to let you wander around with us today? I'm going wherever I want to go, so you should just go back home and take your friends with you. May mercy and truth be with you. 21. And Ittai was like, yo king, swear to the Lord and swear on your life, wherever you go, whether you're dead or alive, your boy Ittai will be right there with you. 22. So like, David was all like, 'Yo, Ittai, go ahead and cross over, man.' And Ittai the Gittite straight up crossed over with all his homies, even the little ones who were chilling with him. 23. Everyone in the whole land was crying loudly, and all the people crossed over. Even the king himself crossed over the brook called Kidron, and all the people crossed over, heading towards the wilderness. 24. And like, dude, Zadok and all the Levites, they were totally vibing with him, carrying the ark of God's pact. So they put down the ark of God, and Abiathar went up until all the people had finished leaving the city, you know? 25. And the king was like, 'Yo Zadok, take the ark of God back to the city. If the LORD thinks I'm cool, He'll bring me back and show me both the ark and His place.' 26. But if he's like, 'I'm not into you anymore,' then, like, here I am, let him do whatever he wants with me. 27. The king was like, 'Bro, aren't you, like, a seer? Go back to the city with peace vibes, and take your two sons with you, Ahimaaz and Jonathan, son of Abiathar.' 28. Yo, I'm gonna chill in the wild until you hit me up with some updates, ya know? 29. So, Zadok and Abiathar brought the ark of God back to Jerusalem and they stayed there. 30. So David went up the hill of Olivet, and he was really sad and crying. He covered his head and walked without shoes. All the people who were with him also covered their heads and cried as they walked up the hill. 31. So, someone came up to David and told him, 'Hey, just so you know, Ahithophel is part of Absalom's little group of people planning against you.' And David was like, 'Oh Lord, I really hope you can do something about that. Can you just make Ahithophel's advice look totally stupid, please? Thanks.' 32. So, like, David reached the absolute peak of the mountain where he was like in total worship mode, right? And out of nowhere, this dude named Hushai the Archite shows up, looking all messed up with his clothes ripped and dirt all over his head, you know? 33. David's like, if you roll with me, bro, you'll just slow me down, man. 34. But like, if you go back to the city and tell Absalom that you wanna be his servant, dude, like as a loyal AF servant to your dad till now, so from now on, I'll totally be your servant too. Then you can count on me to help you outsmart Ahithophel's advice and stuff. 35. Hey, do you have Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you right now? If so, here's the deal: whatever information you get from the king's house, make sure you share it with Zadok and Abiathar ASAP. 36. Yo, check it out, they've got their two sons with them: Ahimaaz, Zadok's kid, and Jonathan, Abiathar's kid. Send them to me with any info you can gather. 37. Then Hushai, David's homie, pulled up in the city, while Absalom rolled into Jerusalem. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 151. And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him. 2. And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was {so}, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him, and said, Of what city {art} thou? And he said, Thy servant {is} of one of the tribes of Israel. {came: Heb. to come} 3. And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters {are} good and right; but {there is} no man {deputed} of the king to hear thee. {there...: or, none will hear thee from the king downward} 4. Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice! 5. And it was {so}, that when any man came nigh {to him} to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him. 6. And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel. 7. And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron. 8. For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD. 9. And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron. 10. But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron. 11. And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, {that were} called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing. 12. And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, {even} from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom. 13. And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom. 14. And David said unto all his servants that {were} with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not {else} escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword. {bring: Heb. thrust} 15. And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy servants {are ready to do} whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint. {appoint: Heb. choose} 16. And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, {which were} concubines, to keep the house. {after...: Heb. at his feet} 17. And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off. 18. And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king. 19. Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king: for thou {art} a stranger, and also an exile. 20. Whereas thou camest {but} yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth {be} with thee. {go up...: Heb. wander in going} 21. And Ittai answered the king, and said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will thy servant be. 22. And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that {were} with him. 23. And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness. {Kidron: Gr. Cedron} 24. And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites {were} with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city. 25. And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and shew me {both} it, and his habitation: 26. But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, {here am} I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him. 27. The king said also unto Zadok the priest, {Art not} thou a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 28. See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me. 29. Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there. 30. And David went up by the ascent of {mount} Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that {was} with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up. {and wept...: Heb. going up and weeping} 31. And {one} told David, saying, Ahithophel {is} among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. 32. And it came to pass, that {when} David was come to the top {of the mount}, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head: 33. Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me: 34. But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; {as} I {have been} thy father's servant hitherto, so {will} I now also {be} thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel. 35. And {hast thou} not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, {that} what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell {it} to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 36. Behold, {they have} there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok's {son}, and Jonathan Abiathar's {son}; and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear. 37. So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 161. And like, when David was just chillin' and almost at the top of the hill, he ran into Ziba, who was Mephibosheth's servant. Ziba had a couple of donkeys all saddled up and carrying two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a bottle of wine, ya know. 2. The king was like, 'Yo, Ziba, what's the deal with all this stuff?' And Ziba was like, 'Well, these donkeys are for the king's squad to ride fancy on, and the bread and fruit are for the young dudes to snack on, and we got some wine for those who feel weak in the wild.' 3. So the king asked, where's your master's son at? And Ziba replied to the king, yo, he's chillin' in Jerusalem. He's all like, today the house of Israel gonna hook me up with my dad's kingdom back. 4. Then the king was like, 'Yo, Ziba, check it out, everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours.' And Ziba was like, 'Yo, please let me find favor in your eyes, my lord, oh king. I'm all humble and stuff.' 5. So, like, when King David pulled up in Bahurim, this dude Shimei, who was from the fam of Saul, straight up came out and started cussing him out, nonstop. No chill whatsoever, just kept at it. 6. Then he threw rocks at David and all of King David's crew: and everyone, including the badass warriors, were standing with him on both sides. 7. And this is what Shimei said when he was cursing: 'Yo, step up, step up, you violent dude, you straight up troublemaker, bro!' 8. OMG, the Lord is totally getting back at you for the bloodshed during Saul's reign. Absalom, your own son, has now taken over the kingdom, and you are literally caught up in your own misfortune because of your violent ways. Seriously, dude, this is some messed up karma coming your way. 9. Abishai, son of Zeruiah, was like, 'Yo, why this dead dog gotta diss my king? Let me handle this and chop off his head for you, fam.' 10. And the king was like, why should I even bother with you, you sons of Zeruiah? If the LORD told him to curse David, then let him curse. Who's gonna question why he did it? 11. Yo, check it. My own flesh and blood, my son, is out here tryna take me down. And this Benjamite? Bet he's got even more motivation. Just leave him be, let him talk smack. The big man upstairs told him to do it anyway. 12. Maybe the LORD will peep my struggles and give me some good karma for all the hate He's getting today. {struggles: or, shedding tears: Hebrew, eye} 13. So, like, David and his crew were just chilling, walking down the road, right? And out of nowhere, Shimei shows up, being all edgy and stuff, walking on the side of the hill like he's so cool. But here's the kicker - this dude starts swearing at David, throws freaking stones at him, and even goes all dramatic and throws dust in his face. Like, seriously? Who does that? 14. And the king, and all the squad that was vibin' with him, rolled up tired AF, and found some chill to recharge themselves there. 15. So Absalom and all the guys from Israel pulled up to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was rolling with them. 16. So, when Hushai the Archite, David's homie, went to Absalom, he said to Absalom, 'Long live the king, long live the king.' 17. And Absalom was like, 'Yo, Hushai, is this how you treat your homie? Why didn't you roll with your homie?'} 18. And Hushai was like, no way dude; I'm totally sticking with whoever the LORD, the peeps, and all the guys from Israel pick, that's who I'm rollin' with! 19. And like, who am I supposed to serve? Like, shouldn't I serve in front of his son too? I mean, I've totally served in your dad's presence, so I'm gonna do the same in your presence, dude. 20. So Absalom was like, 'Yo Ahithophel, let's brainstorm some lit ideas on what moves we should make.' 21. And Ahithophel was like, 'Yo Absalom, you should totally hook up with your dad's concubines that he left behind to take care of the house. That'll show everyone that your dad disapproves of you, and it will give a power boost to all your followers.' 22. So, like, they set up this sick tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom straight up went and hooked up with his dad's side chicks in front of everyone in Israel. 23. And Ahithophel's advice during that time was like seeking guidance from God himself. Both David and Absalom valued and followed Ahithophel's counsel, considering it as wise as seeking divine revelation. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 161. And when David was a little past the top {of the hill}, behold, Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred {loaves} of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottle of wine. 2. And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses {be} for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink. 3. And the king said, And where {is} thy master's son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. 4. Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine {are} all that {pertained} unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee {that} I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king. {I humbly...: Heb. I do obeisance} 5. And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name {was} Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came. {he came forth...: or, he still came forth and cursed} 6. And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men {were} on his right hand and on his left. 7. And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial: {bloody...: Heb. man of blood} 8. The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou {art taken} in thy mischief, because thou {art} a bloody man. {behold...: Heb. behold thee in thy evil} 9. Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. 10. And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? 11. And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now {may this} Benjamite {do it}? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him. 12. It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day. {affliction: or, tears: Heb. eye} 13. And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. {cast...: Heb. dusted him with dust} 14. And the king, and all the people that {were} with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there. 15. And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 16. And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king. {God...: Heb. Let the king live} 17. And Absalom said to Hushai, {Is} this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? 18. And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide. 19. And again, whom should I serve? {should I} not {serve} in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence. 20. Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do. 21. And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that {are} with thee be strong. 22. So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. 23. And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, {was} as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so {was} all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. {oracle: Heb. word} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 171. So Ahithophel was like, 'Yo, Absalom, let me pick twelve thousand homies, and I'll go after David tonight' 2. And I'll totally catch him off guard when he's already tired and has zero energy, and I'll scare the heck out of him. All his buddies will run away for sure, and I'll totally take down the king, like BOOM! 3. And I'll totally gather all the peeps for you, bro: the dude you're looking for will be, like, everyone's back in the squad, fam. So, like, all the people will be chill and peaceful. 4. And Absalom thought this was really cool, and all the older peeps in Israel were on board with it. {thought...: Lit. it was right in the eyes of, etc} 5. Absalom was like, 'Yo, bring Hushai the Archite over here, we wanna hear what he's gotta say too. Like, spill it, bro.' 6. So, when Hushai arrived to see Absalom, he said to him, 'Dude, Ahithophel just said something pretty intense. Should we actually go ahead and do what he suggested? If not, speak up and share your thoughts.' 7. Yo, Absalom, check it. The advice Ahithophel spit ain't on point right now, believe me. #NotFeelinIt #ThinkTwice 8. So, Hushai was like, 'You know your dad and his crew, right? They're straight up tough warriors, always on edge like a mama bear robbed of her cubs in the wild. Your dad is a fierce soldier, he's not gonna chill out with the common folk. You feel me?' 9. Look, he's probably hiding somewhere, like in some secret spot or something. And you know what's gonna happen? As soon as a few of them go down, everyone who hears about it will be like, 'Dude, there's a total massacre going on with Absalom's crew.' 10. And even those who are brave and fearless, with hearts as courageous as a lion's, shall be greatly moved: for all of Israel recognizes the power and strength of your father, and the valiant warriors who stand by his side. 11. So here's the plan: I suggest you gather all of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, like a ton of sand on the beach - that's how many people we need. And then, to make it even more epic, you gotta lead the charge in battle yourself. You know, show off your amazing presence and all that. Let's do this! 12. We'll totally catch him off guard wherever we find him, like dew coming down on the ground. Not a single one of him or his crew will escape our grasp, zero chance. 13. Also, if he manages to escape into a city, all the people of Israel will gather ropes and we'll pull that city into the river until there isn't even a tiny stone left. 14. So Absalom and all the dudes from Israel were like, 'Yo, Hushai the Archite's advice is way better than Ahithophel's! It's straight up divine intervention, man. The LORD made sure that Ahithophel's good advice would fail, just to bring some bad vibes upon Absalom. 15. So Hushai went to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, and told them what advice Ahithophel gave to Absalom and the leaders of Israel. He shared his own counsel as well, saying the same things. 16. So like, send a quick message to David and be like, 'Dude, don't crash in the boring wilderness tonight. Cross it ASAP! Otherwise, the king and everyone with him might get totally wrecked.' 17. So Jonathan and Ahimaaz chilled by Enrogel, because they didn't wanna get caught entering the city. Then this girl slid into their DMs and spilled the tea to them, and they slid into King David's DMs and shared the info. 18. But then a dude saw it and told Absalom. And like, without wasting any time, they both bounced and went to some guy's crib in Bahurim. And this dude had a sick well in his yard, so they dipped down into it. 19. Then the woman grabbed a sheet and covered the opening of the well. She sprinkled some corn meal on it, and nobody found out what she did. 20. And like, when Absalom's friends came to the lady's crib, they were all, 'Yo, where's Ahimaaz and Jonathan at?' And she was like, 'Oh, they dipped to the other side of the water stream, fam.' So they searched for them, but couldn't find them, so they went back to Jerusalem. 21. So, like, after they left, they like climbed out of this well and went to tell King David. They were all like, 'Yo David, wake up and move fast across the water, because Ahithophel is totally plotting against you!' 22. So David got up, and all his crew rolled out too, and they crossed over the Jordan River. And guess what? When morning came, not a single one of them had stayed behind on the other side of the river. All squad goals achieved! 23. And when Ahithophel realized that no one listened to his advice, he quickly packed up, hopped on his ride, went back home to his city, organized his household affairs, sadly took his own life, and was laid to rest in his father's burial place. 24. So David pulled up to Mahanaim, and Absalom and the whole squad of Israel crossed the Jordan with him.  25. Yo, Absalom be like, 'Amasa gonna be the new captain of the crew instead of Joab.' Amasa was the son of some dude named Ithra, who was straight up Israeli. And get this, he even hooked up with Abigail, Nahash's daughter, who's Zeruiah's sister - Joab's mom. (BTW, Ithra might also be called Jether, and Nahash is also known as Jesse, you feel?) 26. So Israel and Absalom were like staying in the land of Gilead. 27. So, like, when David arrived at Mahanaim, there were these dudes named Shobi (Nahash's son from Rabbah of the Ammonites), Machir (Ammiel's son from Lodebar), and Barzillai (the Gileadite from Rogelim) there too. 28. Brought some cool stuff like beds, bowls, clay jars, wheat, barley, flour, toasted corn, beans, lentils, and toasted seeds. (By the way, 'basons' actually means cups!) 29. And they brought honey, and butter, and sheep, and cow cheese for David and his squad to feast on because they were all starving, exhausted, and thirsty in the middle of nowhere. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 171. Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night: 2. And I will come upon him while he {is} weary and weak handed, and will make him afraid: and all the people that {are} with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only: 3. And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom thou seekest {is} as if all returned: {so} all the people shall be in peace. 4. And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel. {pleased...: Heb. was right in the eyes of, etc} 5. Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear likewise what he saith. {what...: Heb. what is in his mouth} 6. And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do {after} his saying? if not; speak thou. {his saying: Heb. his word} 7. And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath given {is} not good at this time. {given: Heb. counselled} 8. For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they {be} mighty men, and they {be} chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father {is} a man of war, and will not lodge with the people. {chafed...: Heb. bitter of soul} 9. Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some {other} place: and it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom. {overthrown: Heb. fallen} 10. And he also {that is} valiant, whose heart {is} as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father {is} a mighty man, and {they} which {be} with him {are} valiant men. 11. Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that {is} by the sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own person. {that thou...: Heb. that thy face, or, presence go, etc} 12. So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that {are} with him there shall not be left so much as one. 13. Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river, until there be not one small stone found there. 14. And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite {is} better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon Absalom. {appointed: Heb. commanded} 15. Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled. 16. Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that {are} with him. 17. Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them; and they went and told king David. 18. Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went down. 19. And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not known. 20. And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where {is} Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find {them}, they returned to Jerusalem. 21. And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you. 22. Then David arose, and all the people that {were} with him, and they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over Jordan. 23. And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled {his} ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father. {followed: Heb. done} {put his...: Heb. gave charge concerning his house} 24. Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 25. And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa {was} a man's son, whose name {was} Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother. {Ithra an Israelite: or, Jether an Ishmaelite} {Abigail: Heb. Abigal} {Nahash: or, Jesse} 26. So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead. 27. And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim, 28. Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and parched {corn}, and beans, and lentiles, and parched {pulse}, {basons: or, cups} 29. And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for David, and for the people that {were} with him, to eat: for they said, The people {is} hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 181. So David counted all the people rolled up with him, and appointed leaders with swag over squads of thousands and squads of hundreds. 2. So David split the people into three groups. One group was led by Joab, another by Abishai (Joab's brother), and the third by Ittai the Gittite. The king himself even said, 'I'm definitely coming along with you guys too.' 3. But the squad replied, like, you can't bounce. If we dip, they won't even give a dang about us. And even if half of us bite the dust, they still won't care. But you, bro, you're worth, like, ten thousand of us. So it's way better if you save us and get us out of this place. 4. And the king was like, 'So, fam, what do y'all think I should do?' And he posted up by the gate, and all the people came out in big numbers, like hundreds and thousands. 5. The king was like, 'Hey Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, I need you to handle Absalom with care - like, be gentle with the dude. And everyone was listening when the king laid down the law to all the captains about Absalom. 6. So, like, these peeps came at Israel in the field, and the battle went down in the wood of Ephraim, ya know. 7. So like, the Israelites got all wrecked by David's crew, and yo, it was a massive beatdown with like, twenty thousand dudes down for the count that day. 8. Yo, the battle was crazy, spread out all over the place. But yo, the forest, it straight up wrecked more people that day than the sword did. Like, it went on a munching spree, you feel me? 9. So Absalom came across some of David's servants. And Absalom was riding on a cool mule, the mule went under some big oak tree branches, and Absalom's head got stuck in the oak. He ended up dangling between the sky and the ground while the mule he was riding ran off. 10. So there was this guy who spotted it and he totally let Joab know, like, 'Yo, check it out, man! I saw Absalom hanging from this oak!' 11. Joab was like, 'Dude, you saw him and you didn't take him down? Seriously, you could've scored ten shekels of silver and a rad girdle.' 12. And the dude said to Joab, even if I got a thousand bucks in my hand, I still wouldn't lay a finger on the king's son. 'Cause we all heard the king warn you, Abishai, and Ittai, and tell you to be careful not to harm young Absalom. 13. If I did that, I would be lying to myself and that's a major L for me. 'Cause, like, the king knows everything, no secrets. And you, dude, would totally be opposing me. 14. Joab was like, 'Yo, I can't just chill here forever.' So he grabs three darts and straight up stabs them into Absalom's heart while he's still breathing, right in the middle of this oak tree. 15. Then ten dudes with Joab's swaggy armor surrounded Absalom and totally wrecked him, taking him out! 16. Then Joab blasted the trumpet, and the squad dipped out from chasing Israel 'cause Joab got 'em to back off. 17. So they captured Absalom and threw him into a massive pit in the woods, piling up a bunch of huge rocks on top of him. Then all the people of Israel scattered and went back to their own tents. 18. Back in the day, Absalom decided to flex and built this huge pillar in the king's dale, you know? He was like, 'Yo, I don't have a son to carry on my name, so let's make sure people never forget me!' That's why he named the pillar after himself, and everyone still calls it Absalom's place even now. 19. So Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, was like 'Yo, let me bounce and tell the king the good news that the LORD totally wrecked his enemies, like, super judged them and stuff. #straightup 20. And Joab was like, 'Dude, not today. Take a raincheck on delivering news. The king's son passed away, man. Give it a rest for now.' 21. So Joab said to Cushi, 'Yo, go tell the king what you just peeped. And Cushi bowed down to Joab, then dipped out in a hurry.' 22. So Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, asked Joab again, dude, can I also chase after Cushi? And Joab was like, bro, why would you run when you have no news to deliver yet? 23. But dude, listen, let me go for it. And he's like, 'Go for it, man!' So Ahimaaz bolts through the open field and zooms right past Cushi. 24. So, like, David was chilling between the two gates, right? And then this watchman dude goes up to the roof over the gate and checks it out, you know? He looks up and sees this dude running all by himself. 25. Then the lookout dude yelled out and told the king what was up. And the king was like, 'If he's all by himself, he's probs got some news to spill.' So the guy hurried over and got closer. 26. The lookout spotted another dude sprinting, so he hollered at the gatekeeper, like, 'Yo, check it out, there's this one dude running all by himself.' And the king was like, Wordd, he must be bringing some important news or something.' 27. The watchman was like, dude, the guy in front is totally running like Ahimaaz, Zadok's son. And the king was like, yeah, he's legit and probably bringing some awesome news. (By the way, when the watchman said 'I see the running', he meant 'I totally noticed how fast he's running'). 28. And Ahimaaz called out to the king and said, 'Everything is good, man.' And he fell down on the ground, face to the floor, in front of the king, and said, Praisee the Lord your God, who totally took care of those dudes who dared to mess with you, man.' 29. And the king was like, yo, is Absalom doing okay, bro? And Ahimaaz was like, well, when Joab sent the king's servant and also ya boy me, I saw mad chaos, but I had no clue what was going down. Was it all good, tho? 30. And the king's like, 'Yo, you, step aside and chill. So dude steps aside and just stays put. 31. Yo, listen up! Cushi just rolled in and he's like, 'Yo, my lord the king, I got some big news! The LORD totally took revenge for you today on all those haters who were against you. Like, seriously, it's lit! #Tidings #BossMoves 32. The king was like, yo Cushi, is young Absalom chillin' alright? And Cushi was like, don't trip my lord, any fools tryin' to bring you down be just as shut down as Absalom, man. 33. The king was so emotional, he went up to the room above the gate and cried his heart out. While he was walking, he kept repeating, 'Oh, my dude Absalom, my bro, my homie Absalom! I wish I could've taken your place, dude, oh Absalom, my bro, my homie!' \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 181. And David numbered the people that {were} with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them. 2. And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also. 3. But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now {thou art} worth ten thousand of us: therefore now {it is} better that thou succour us out of the city. {care...: Heb. set their heart on us} {worth...: Heb. as ten thousand of us} {succour: Heb. be to succour or help} 4. And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do. And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands. 5. And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, {Deal} gently for my sake with the young man, {even} with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom. 6. So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was in the wood of Ephraim; 7. Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand {men}. 8. For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured. {devoured: Heb. multiplied to devour} 9. And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that {was} under him went away. 10. And a certain man saw {it}, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak. 11. And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest {him}, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have given thee ten {shekels} of silver, and a girdle. 12. And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand {shekels} of silver in mine hand, {yet} would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none {touch} the young man Absalom. {receive: Heb. weigh upon mine hand} {Beware...: Heb. Beware whosoever ye be of, etc} 13. Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against {me}. 14. Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he {was} yet alive in the midst of the oak. {with...: Heb. before thee} {midst: Heb. heart} 15. And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. 16. And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people. 17. And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent. 18. Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which {is} in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place. 19. Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies. {avenged...: Heb. judged him from the hand, etc} 20. And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead. {bear tidings this: Heb. be a man of tidings, etc} 21. Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran. 22. Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? {howsoever: Heb. be what may} {ready: or, convenient} 23. But howsoever, {said he}, let me run. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi. 24. And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone. 25. And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he {be} alone, {there is} tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew near. 26. And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold {another} man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings. 27. And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king said, He {is} a good man, and cometh with good tidings. {Me...: Heb. I see the running} 28. And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed {be} the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king. {All...: or, Peace be to thee: Heb. Peace} {delivered...: Heb. shut up} 29. And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and {me} thy servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what {it was}. {Is...: Heb. Is there peace?} 30. And the king said {unto him}, Turn aside, {and} stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still. 31. And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee. {Tidings: Heb. Tidings is brought} 32. And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee to do {thee} hurt, be as {that} young man {is}. 33. And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son! \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 191. Yo, Joab got some news, like, the king's totally crying and grieving over Absalom. 2. And that epic win that day quickly became a total downer for everyone: because word got around that day about how devastated the king was when he heard that his son had passed away. (victory: in Hebrew it means salvation or deliverance) 3. So, like, the people sneaked into the city on the down-low that day, you know? Kinda like when you're feeling embarrassed or whatever and you discreetly slip away during a chaotic fight. 4. But then the king, like, hid his face and just broke down, shouting at the top of his lungs, like, 'Oh my dude Absalom! Absalom, bro, my son, my son!' 5. Yo, Joab pulled up to the king's crib and straight up told him, bro, you made all your homies feel embarrassed and disrespected today. Like, we literally risked our lives to save you, your kids, your wives, and even your side pieces, man. 6. You're like, totally loving your haters while hating on your squad, man. Like, you're not even caring whether they're famous or just regular peeps. It's like, today you're showing that if Absalom was alive and the rest of us were gone, you'd be totally stoked. #bylovingyourhaters #noprinceorservantneeded 7. So, like, get up, go out there, and like, speak in a way that brings good vibes to your crew. Seriously, I promise by the LORD, if you don't go out there, you'll be all alone tonight, and that's gonna be way worse for you than any bad stuff that's ever happened to you before. {comfortably...: Haha, I mean, speak straight to the heart of your peeps} 8. So, the king got up and chilled near the entrance. And word got out to everyone like, 'Yo, check it out, the king's posted up at the entrance.' And all the folks gathered 'round the king 'cause everyone in Israel had gone back to their own tents. 9. And everyone was so shook, I mean like legit fighting and arguing all over Israel, like OMG. They were like, 'Dude, the king totally saved us from our enemies and the Philistines, you know? And now he just straight up dipped out of the country because of Absalom.' 10. Hey y'all, just a heads up, Absalom, the dude we voted to be our leader, he's like, totally dead from a crazy battle. So like, why aren't we even talking about bringing the king back? Like, seriously, why is everyone being so quiet about it? #BringBackTheKing 11. King David hit up Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, and was all like, 'Yo, spread the word to the old heads in Judah. Like, why y'all takin' so long to bring the king back home? Everyone in Israel is already with him and stuff, right at his crib.' 12. You guys, we're like family, legit! So why are you slacking and being slow to bring the king back? 13. Yo, Amasa, bro, are you not like, my fam? I swear on everything, if you don't become the main leader of my crew instead of Joab, may God punish me big time and even more. 14. And he totally united all the guys from Judah, like they were all on the same page; they hit up the king saying, 'Yo, come back with all your crew.' 15. So the king came back and headed to Jordan. And Judah met up at Gilgal to welcome the king and escort him across the Jordan. 16. So this dude named Shimei, son of Gera, who's from Benjamite crew, straight up rushed down from Bahurim to link up with the squad of Judah and meet up with king David. 17. And like, there were, like, a thousand dudes from Benjamin rollin' with him, and also Ziba, who was, like, Saul's servant, and also his fifteen sons and his twenty other servants were there too. And they all, like, crossed the Jordan River before the king. 18. So this ferry boat rolls up to transport the king's crew and help him do his thing. As soon as King David crosses the Jordan, Shimei, son of Gera, bows down before him like, 'Sup, dude?' 19. And I told the king, Please don't blame me for my mistakes, and don't dwell on the dumb stuff I did when you left Jerusalem. Don't let it bother you, king. 20. Okay, so your boy here knows that I messed up, no cap. That's why I'm the first one from the squad repping Joseph's crib to come through and meet up with my main man, the king. 21. Yo, Abishai, Zeruiah’s son, was like, 'Can't we just straight up slay Shimei for disrespecting the anointed of the LORD?' 22. So, like, David was all like, 'Yo, why are you, sons of Zeruiah, trying to be my enemies today? Are we really gonna kill someone in Israel today? I mean, come on, guys, I'm the king of Israel, don't forget! 23. So the king was like, 'Yo Shimei, you ain't gonna die, man. And the king was like, 'Swear, bro.' 24. So Mephibosheth, Saul's son, went up to the king and he didn't even bother to freshen up his look – didn't dress his feet, trim his beard, or wash his clothes – from the day the king left until the day he returned safely. 25. So, like, when he finally arrived in Jerusalem to see the king, the king was like, 'Dude, why didn't you come with me, Mephibosheth?' 26. And he was like, yo king, my servant totally played me. I was like, I'm gonna hop on this donkey and roll over to see you, but dude, I'm hella lame. 27. And he's totally talked smack about your boy to the king, but the king is legit like an angel from heaven: so do whatever you think is cool, dude. 28. Dude, everyone from my dad's crew were basically toast in front of you, the king. But you still chose to let me hang with the cool kids at your table. So, like, why should I even bother crying to the king anymore? They were all as good as done for, ya know? 29. And the king was like, why are you still talking about your stuff? I already told you, you and Ziba gotta split the land. 30. And Mephibosheth was like, 'Totally, let him have it all. My dude the king is back home safe and sound.' 31. So Barzillai, from Gilead, came down from Rogelim and crossed the Jordan River with the king to help him get across safely. 32. Barzillai was, like, super old, around eighty years old or whatever, and he totally hooked up the king with food while he was chillin' in Mahanaim. Like, this dude was a total legend. 33. And the king was like, 'Hey Barzillai, come chill with me in Jerusalem and I'll hook you up with some dope food.' 34. And Barzillai was like, yo, king, how much time do I have left? Like, should I even roll with you to Jerusalem? 35. Yo, I'm eighty years old today. Can't your boy here tell the difference between right and wrong? Can I even enjoy my food and drinks anymore? Don't even get me started on my ability to hear singing voices. So why should I continue being a burden to you, my king? 36. Your boy/girl gonna roll for a bit across the Jordan River with the king, but why should the king hook me up with such a sick reward? 37. Hey, please let me go back to my hometown so I can pass away there and be buried alongside my parents. But, check it out, let your homie Chimham roll with you, king, and do whatever you think is best for him. 38. The king was like, 'Chimham, you can totally come with me. I'll treat you however you want me to, and I'll do anything you ask of me.' 39. So, like, everyone crossed the Jordan River, ya know? And when the king made it across, he gave Barzillai a smooch, and, like, blessed him and stuff. Then Barzillai went back to his own crib. 40. Then the king rolled up to Gilgal with Chimham in tow, and all the Judah squad escorted the king, along with half of Israel's crew. #SquadGoals #Gilgal #KingTime 41. So, like, all the dudes from Israel came to the king and were all like, yo dude, why did our bros from Judah snatch you up and bring you, your fam, and all of David's peeps with you across the Jordan river? 42. And all the Judah peeps were like, yo, to the Israel fam, chillax! The king's like fam to us. So why you trippin' over this? Did we even cop a bite from the king's grub? Or did he hook us up with any swag? 43. Yo, the Israel dudes spoke up to the Judah dudes and were like, 'Bro, we're like ten times more connected to the king and we're even more loyal to David than you! So why did you diss us and not consider our advice when it came to bringing back our king?' And let me tell you, the words coming out of the Judah guys' mouths were even more intense than what the Israel guys said. They straight up disrespected us, man. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 191. And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom. 2. And the victory that day was {turned} into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son. {victory: Heb. salvation, or, deliverance} 3. And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 4. But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! 5. And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 6. In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well. {in...: Heb. By loving, etc} {that thou regardest...: Heb. that princes or servants are not to thee} 7. Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now. {comfortably...: Heb. to the heart of thy servants} 8. Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled every man to his tent. 9. And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom. 10. And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back? {speak...: Heb. are ye silent?} 11. And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all Israel is come to the king, {even} to his house. 12. Ye {are} my brethren, ye {are} my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king? 13. And say ye to Amasa, {Art} thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab. 14. And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as {the heart of} one man; so that they sent {this word} unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants. 15. So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over Jordan. 16. And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which {was} of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David. 17. And {there were} a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the king. 18. And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan; {what...: Heb. the good in his eyes} 19. And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart. 20. For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king. 21. But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed? 22. And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I {am} this day king over Israel? 23. Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him. 24. And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came {again} in peace. 25. And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth? 26. And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant {is} lame. 27. And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king {is} as an angel of God: do therefore {what is} good in thine eyes. 28. For all {of} my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king? {dead...: Heb. men of death} 29. And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land. 30. And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house. 31. And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan. 32. Now Barzillai was a very aged man, {even} fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he {was} a very great man. 33. And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem. 34. And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem? {How...: Heb. How many days are the years of my life} 35. I {am} this day fourscore years old: {and} can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king? 36. Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? 37. Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, {and be buried} by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee. 38. And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, {that} will I do for thee. {require: Heb. choose} 39. And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place. 40. Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel. {Chimham: Heb. Chimhan} 41. And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all David's men with him, over Jordan? 42. And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king {is} near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's {cost}? or hath he given us any gift? 43. And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more {right} in David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel. {despise...: Heb. set us at light} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 201. And there was this dude named Sheba, the son of Bichri, from the tribe of Benjamin, and he was totally shady. He starts causing some drama by blowing a trumpet and declaring that we ain't down with David or Jesse's son anymore. He's like, 'Alright everyone, time to split and go back to our own tents, Israel! No more loyalty here.' 2. So, like, all the guys from Israel, they ditched David and started following this dude named Sheba, son of Bichri. But the dudes from Judah stayed loyal to their king, from Jordan all the way to Jerusalem. 3. And David went back to his crib in Jerusalem; and the king gathered his ten side chicks, who he had left to hold down the fort, and put them on lockdown, providing for them but not getting busy with them. So they were kept locked up until they died, living their lives as widows. 4. So the king was like, yo Amasa, gather up the squad from Judah in three days, and make sure you're here too. {Gather up: Heb. Call} 5. So Amasa went to gather the crew from Judah, but he took longer than the expected time he had given him. (Gather: Hebrew - Call) 6. Yo, Abishai, listen up, Sheba, Bichri's kid, is gonna cause us even more trouble than Absalom did. Round up your crew, take the squad from the king, and chase after him. We can't let him find a safe haven in some fortified cities and slip away from our grasp. 7. So, Joab's squad, along with the Cherethites, Pelethites, and all the powerful warriors, hit the road from Jerusalem to chase Sheba, Bichri's son! 8. When they arrived at the awesome stone in Gibeon, Amasa took the lead. And Joab's outfit, which he had put on, was cinched around him with a stylish belt, with a sword attached to it hanging on his waist, safely tucked in its sheath. But as he walked, it suddenly slipped out. 9. Yo Joab was like, 'Yo Amasa, how you doing, bro?' And then Joab grabbed Amasa's beard with his right hand to give him a bro hug. 10. But Amasa completely overlooked the fact that Joab had a sword in his hand, so Joab used it to strike him in the side, causing his bowels to spill out onto the ground. However, Joab didn't strike him again; his one blow was enough to kill Amasa. After that, Joab and his brother Abishai continued their pursuit of Sheba, son of Bichri. (Additional note: Joab intentionally didn't strike him again with full force) 11. So basically, this dude from Joab's crew spoke up and was like, 'If you're all about Joab or you're Team David, then you better go roll with Joab, okay?' 12. And Amasa was covered in blood on the road. When people saw that, they all stopped in their tracks. One guy moved Amasa off the road and onto the grassy field, then covered him with a cloth so that everyone passing by would pause as well. 13. Once he was taken off the road, everyone followed Joab and went after Sheba, Bichri's son. 14. And he traveled to all the tribes of Israel, including Abel, Bethmaachah, and the Berites. They all gathered together and followed him too. 15. So basically, they surrounded him in Abel of Bethmaachah and even built a barricade to attack the city. It was like a showdown! Joab and his crew relentlessly attacked the wall, trying to bring it down. They were going all out, no holding back. 16. So this super smart woman from the city was like, 'Hey, listen up! Can you please tell Joab to come over here? I really need to chat with him.' 17. And when he approached her, the woman asked, 'Are you Joab?' And he replied, 'Yes, it's me.' Then she said to him, 'Listen to what your servant has to say.' And he responded, 'I'm listening.' 18. So she said, like back in the day people used to say that they would totally seek advice from Abel, and that would settle things, you know. They were like, 'Let's just ask Abel and that'll be it.' 19. I'm one of the chill and loyal ones in Israel: you're trying to wreck a city and a major figure in Israel: why would you mess with what God gave us? 20. And Joab was like, no way, no way dude, I would never, ever, even think about swallowing up or destroying anything, no chance. 21. Like, this situation is totally not cool, dude. So there's this guy named Sheba, from Mount Ephraim, and he straight up decided to rebel against the king, David. If you hand him over to us, we'll peace out of your city, no problemo. And check it, the woman was like, 'Hey Joab, we'll toss his head over the wall to you, no biggie.' 22. So, the woman went to everyone, being really smart about it. And they totally got rid of Sheba, son of Bichri, by cutting off his head and throwing it to Joab. Then Joab, like, blew a trumpet and everybody just scattered from the city and went back to their tents. Joab went back to Jerusalem to see the king. 23. So Joab was basically in charge of all the guys in Israel, and Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, was the boss of the Cherethites and the Pelethites. 24. Adoram was in charge of collecting taxes, and Jehoshaphat, Ahilud's son, was the guy who kept records and remembered important stuff. 25. And Sheva was like the ultimate scribe, you know, top-notch in recording everything. Zadok and Abiathar were holding it down as the priests, doing their holy thing. 26. And Ira, a total boss from the Jairite fam, had major authority alongside David. {major authority...: or, a top-tier leader} \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 201. And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name {was} Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel. 2. So every man of Israel went up from after David, {and} followed Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem. 3. And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took the ten women {his} concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood. {ward: Heb. an house of ward} {shut...: Heb. bound} {living...: Heb. in widowhood of life} 4. Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah within three days, and be thou here present. {Assemble: Heb. Call} 5. So Amasa went to assemble {the men of} Judah: but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him. {Assemble: Heb. Call} 6. And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than {did} Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us. {escape...: Heb. deliver himself from our eyes} 7. And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 8. When they {were} at the great stone which {is} in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded unto him, and upon it a girdle {with} a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out. 9. And Joab said to Amasa, {Art} thou in health, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him. 10. But Amasa took no heed to the sword that {was} in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth {rib}, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri. {struck...: Heb. doubled not his stroke} 11. And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favoureth Joab, and he that {is} for David, {let him go} after Joab. 12. And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still. 13. When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri. 14. And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him. 15. And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the trench: and all the people that {were} with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down. {in the trench: or, against the outmost wall} {battered: Heb. marred to throw down} 16. Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with thee. 17. And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, {Art} thou Joab? And he answered, I {am he}. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear. 18. Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask {counsel} at Abel: and so they ended {the matter}. {They were...: or, They plainly spake in the beginning, saying, Surely they will ask of Abel, and so make an end} 19. I {am one of them that are} peaceable {and} faithful in Israel: thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD? 20. And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy. 21. The matter {is} not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, {even} against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall. {by name: Heb. by his name} 22. Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast {it} out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king. {retired: Heb. were scattered} 23. Now Joab {was} over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada {was} over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites: 24. And Adoram {was} over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud {was} recorder: {recorder: or, remembrancer} 25. And Sheva {was} scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar {were} the priests: 26. And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David. {a chief...: or, a prince} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 211. So basically, there was this huge famine going on during David's time for three whole years, like every single year. And guess what? David was like, 'Yo, God, what's up with this famine?' And let me tell you, God had an answer ready. It turns out, it was all because of Saul and his brutal actions against the Gibeonites. So yeah, David sought God's guidance on this issue, and he got some serious insight. 2. So the king hits up the Gibeonites, and he's like, 'Yo, listen up! Just so you know, the Gibeonites aren't actually part of the Israelite crew. They're like leftovers from the Amorites. But, you know what? The Israelites made a promise to them, so we gotta respect that. Oh, and by the way, Saul, in his intense loyalty to the Israelites and Judah, tried to kill them. 3. So David was like, yo Gibeonites, what can I do to make it up to you? How can I make things right, so that you can bless God's inheritance? 4. The Gibeonites were like, 'We ain't interested in Saul's money or his peeps. You don't gotta kill anyone from Israel for us.' And he was like, 'Whatever you guys want, I got you.' 5. So they said to the king, this dude totally wrecked us and planned to wipe us out from all over Israel! 6. Yo, give us seven of his sons and we'll hang them up for the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, cuz the LORD chose that spot, ya know? And the king was like, 'Yeah, I'll hand 'em over. They're the LORD's chosen ones.' 7. But the king was like, 'Nah, Mephibosheth, you cool. You gotta chill, bro. I made a promise to the LORD to look out for you, 'cause you're Jonathan's son and all. It's all about that bond between David and Jonathan, straight up'. 8. Yo, the king took the two sons of Rizpah, who was Saul's daughter, named Armoni and Mephibosheth. He also took the five sons of Michal, Saul's other daughter, who was raised by Adriel, Barzillai the Meholathite's son. (BTW, Michal's sister also brought up these sons for Adriel.) 9. And he gave them over to the Gibeonites, who hung them on the hill in front of the LORD. All seven of them fell together and were killed during harvest time, at the beginning of the barley harvest. 10. So Rizpah, Aiah's daughter, grabbed some sackcloth and laid it out on the rock. She stayed there from the start of harvest until rain fell from the sky, making sure no birds chilled on them during the day and no animals crashed there at night. 11. So, like, they told David what Rizpah, daughter of Aiah and Saul's side chick, did. 12. So David went and grabbed the bones of Saul and Jonathan from the people of Jabeshgilead, who had snatched them from the streets of Bethshan where the Philistines had left them hanging after they had killed Saul in Gilboa: 13. So he took the bones of Saul and Jonathan, his son, and gathered the bones of those who were hanged from there. 14. So they laid to rest the remains of Saul and his son Jonathan in the land of Benjamin at Zelah, in the tomb of Kish, his father. They obeyed all of the king's instructions. And it was only then that God answered their prayers and brought blessing to the land. 15. So, like, the Philistines were, like, at it again, having another round of war with Israel, and David was like, 'Nah, I'm not just gonna sit back and chill,' so he rolled up with his squad and straight up battled those Philistines. And let me tell you, David was giving his all, but he started feeling pretty tired, man. 16. So there was this dude named Ishbibenob, who was from a whole line of giants. This guy had a serious heavy spear, like three hundred shekels of solid brass heavy. And get this, he was rocking a brand new sword too. He actually thought he could take down David, but nah, didn't happen. David ain't no easy target, you know? 17. Abishai, Zeruiah's son, came through for him. He attacked the Philistine and took him down. After that, David's crew vowed to him, saying, 'You're done with battling with us, we won't let you dim the shine of Israel anymore.' (Note: In Hebrew, 'shine' means candle or lamp.) 18. So, like, there was another fight with the Philistines at Gob after all that, and this dude named Sibbechai, who's from Hushath, totally killed Saph, who was one of those giant dudes. You know, the son of the giant. (Or maybe they called him Rapha, who knows?) 19. So, there was another epic showdown in Gob between the Philistines and Elhanan, the son of Jaareoregim, who's from Bethlehem. And get this, Elhanan totally defeated Goliath the Gittite, who happened to be the brother of the one and only Goliath, the famous giant. Goliath's weapon was huge, like a super thick weaver's beam. Oh and just in case you're wondering, Jaareoregim is also known as Jair. 20. So there was this epic battle going down in Gath, and there was this insanely tall dude with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, making a total of twenty-four digits. And get this, he was even born from a giant family. 21. And when he disrespected Israel, Jonathan, the bro of David, totally took him out. {disrespected: or, dissed} {bro: also known as, homie} 22. These four were born to the absolute unit in Gath, and got wrecked by David and his squad. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 211. Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, {It is} for Saul, and for {his} bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites. {enquired...: Heb. sought the face, etc} 2. And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites {were} not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.) 3. Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of the LORD? 4. And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, {that} will I do for you. {We will...: or, It is not silver nor gold that we have to do with Saul or his house, neither pertains it to us to kill, etc} 5. And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us {that} we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of Israel, {devised...: or, cut us off} 6. Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, {whom} the LORD did choose. And the king said, I will give {them}. {whom...: or, chosen of the LORD} 7. But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of the LORD'S oath that {was} between them, between David and Jonathan the son of Saul. 8. But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite: {Michal: or, Michal's sister} {brought...: Heb. bear to Adriel} 9. And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell {all} seven together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first {days}, in the beginning of barley harvest. 10. And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night. 11. And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. 12. And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa: 13. And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged. 14. And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land. 15. Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint. 16. And Ishbibenob, which {was} of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear {weighed} three hundred {shekels} of brass in weight, he being girded with a new {sword}, thought to have slain David. {the giant: or, Rapha} {spear: Heb. the staff, or, the head} 17. But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel. {light: Heb. candle, or, lamp} 18. And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph, which {was} of the sons of the giant. {the giant: or, Rapha} {Saph: or, Sippai} 19. And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew {the brother of} Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear {was} like a weaver's beam. {Jaareoregim: or, Jair} 20. And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of {great} stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant. {the giant: or, Rapha} 21. And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea the brother of David slew him. {defied: or, reproached} {Shimea: also called, Shammah} 22. These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 221. So, David straight up talked to God and dropped this sick song when the Lord came through and saved him from all his enemies, including Saul: 2. He's like, God is my rock, my safe haven, and my savior. 3. The one above all else, my trusted rock. He's my protector and my source of salvation, my ultimate defense, and my safe haven. He rescues me from harm and violence. 4. I'm gonna hit up the LORD, who's totally worthy of mad praise, and that's how I'm gonna be saved from all my haters. 5. When death's waves surrounded me and a bunch of ungodly people gave me major anxiety; like, it was so scary, you know? 6. I was totally surrounded by the worst kind of pain and suffering; I couldn't escape the clutches of death; (sorrows: or, cords) 7. When I was freaking out, I hit up the LORD and straight up pleaded to my God. And you know what? He totally heard me, like straight from his headquarters, and my cry reached his ears and all. 8. Like, the ground totally shook and trembled, and even the foundations of heaven were all like, moving and shaking, 'cause God was, like, super mad. 9. Smoke started billowing from his nose and fire spewed from his mouth, devouring everything in its path. The coals were blazing as a result. 10. He flexed the skies and pulled a sick move; total darkness was like, 'Bruh, chill' below him. 11. And he hopped on a cherub and yeeted through the air, and everyone saw him going fast like on the wind! 12. And like, he created these super cool dark pavilions all around him, filled with dark waters, plus those totally dense clouds in the sky. It was like a total binding of waters, you know? Like, so mysterious and awesome! 13. Before him were fiery coals shining brightly. 14. OMG, the LORD came in with some major thunder from above, and the Most High straight up dropped a sick line. 15. And he shot out some arrows, totally scattered them; lightning struck, and totally messed them up. 16. Yo, the ocean got all wild and crazy, the depths of the earth were exposed when the Lord got all fired up, like he was blowing a huge gust of air from his nose. 17. He slid into my DMs, grabbed my attention, and rescued me from drowning in a sea of problems; {many: or, great} 18. He totally saved me from my major enemy, like, the one who totally hated me and was, like, super powerful and stuff. I mean, they were way too strong for me to handle on my own. 19. They totally ruined my vibe when I was going through some major struggles: but the LORD had my back all the way. 20. He like totally took me to this awesome place: he saved me, 'coz he thought I was pretty rad. 21. God totally hooked me up, recognizing my righteousness and giving me mad props for keeping my hands clean. 22. I've stayed true to the vibes of the LORD, never straying into wickedness and keeping it real with my God. 23. I was totally down with all of his righteous rulings, and I never ditched his awesome laws. 24. I was, like, living righteously in front of him and minding my own business without doing anything wrong. 25. So like, God totally rewarded me based on how dope I've been in living righteously, you know? He saw me all clean and pure and honored me accordingly. #blessed #God'sGotMyBack 26. When someone is kind to others, you'll show kindness to them too. And when someone is honest and righteous, you'll be honest and righteous to them. 27. When you're genuine, you'll attract genuine people, but when you're full of attitude, you'll only turn people off. 28. And like, you totally got the backs of the people who are struggling, but you're also keeping an eye out for those arrogant ones, so you can totally bring them down. 29. You're my ultimate source of light, LORD, and You'll illuminate all my darkest moments. 30. Because of you, I've totally crushed it! With my crew, I've jumped over obstacles like a boss. Like, my God is just that amazing! No challenge is too big for us. #Unstoppable 31. God's got it all figured out; His words are totally legit. He's like a total shield for those who put their trust in Him. Like, He's been through some serious tests and passed with flying colors. No doubt about it. 32. Like, seriously, who even compares to the LORD? And I mean, who else can be as solid as our God? 33. God is, like, totally my source of strength and power. He's, like, the one who makes my path super flawless and stuff. (By the way, 'maketh' means 'riddeth' or 'looseth' in Hebrew, just so you know.) 34. He makes my feet agile like deer's feet and sets me upon high places. 35. He's like my personal battle coach, training me to be a total beast in combat. I'm so powerful, I can snap a steel bow with my bare arms! 36. You've hooked me up with your salvation shield and your chill vibes have totally leveled me up. {leveled me up...: Heb. multiplied me} 37. You've totally expanded my territory and made sure I stayed steady. Like, no way I'm gonna slip and fall, no doubt. 38. I went after my haters and totally wiped them out; I didn't stop until I completely took them down. 39. And I totally defeated them and took them down, leaving them unable to get back up. Yup, they've totally fallen under my feet. 40. You've equipped me with the power to face my enemies head on. You've made those who dared to oppose me surrender to my greatness. 41. You totally handed over my enemies to me, so I could totally wipe out the haters. 42. They searched for help, but no one could rescue them. They reached out to the LORD, but He didn't respond. 43. I totally crushed them, like, so hard that they became dust, and I stepped on them like they were dirt in the street, and scattered them all around. 44. Yo, you totally saved me from dealing with all the drama from my peeps. Like, you made me the boss of all these foreign nations that I didn't even know would end up serving me. So rad, dude! 45. Random people will totally respect me: once they catch wind of what I'm sayin', they'll be like, 'Yes, I'm on board!' {Random people: It's a fancy way of sayin' people who don't really know me} {submit...: or, act like they're all in, when really, they're not} 46. Randoms be ghosting, straight up spooked hiding in their comfort zones. 47. OMG, the LORD is so lit! Shout out to my rock, he's totally blessed. And let's give props to God, the ultimate rock who saves me. #blessed 48. God's got my back, taking down anyone who messes with me. 49. And that's what saved me from my haters: you totally boosted me above all those who tried to bring me down: you totally saved me from the toxic person. 50. So I'm gonna show mad appreciation to you, LORD, in front of all these peeps, and I'm gonna sing your name like no other. 51. He's like the ultimate savior for his king, showing mad love to his chosen one, David, and his descendants for eternity. No cap. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 221. And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day {that} the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul: 2. And he said, The LORD {is} my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; 3. The God of my rock; in him will I trust: {he is} my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence. 4. I will call on the LORD, {who is} worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies. 5. When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid; {waves: or, pangs} {ungodly...: Heb. Belial} 6. The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me; {sorrows: or, cords} 7. In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry {did enter} into his ears. 8. Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth. 9. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it. {out of his nostrils: Heb. by, etc} 10. He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness {was} under his feet. 11. And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind. 12. And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, {and} thick clouds of the skies. {dark...: Heb. binding of waters} 13. Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled. 14. The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice. 15. And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them. 16. And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils. 17. He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters; {many: or, great} 18. He delivered me from my strong enemy, {and} from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me. 19. They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay. 20. He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me. 21. The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me. 22. For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God. 23. For all his judgments {were} before me: and {as for} his statutes, I did not depart from them. 24. I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity. {before: Heb. to} 25. Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight. {in...: Heb. before his eyes} 26. With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, {and} with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright. 27. With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury. {shew thyself unsavoury: or, wrestle} 28. And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes {are} upon the haughty, {that} thou mayest bring {them} down. 29. For thou {art} my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness. {lamp: or, candle} 30. For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall. {run: or, broken} 31. {As for} God, his way {is} perfect; the word of the LORD {is} tried: he {is} a buckler to all them that trust in him. {tried: or, refined} 32. For who {is} God, save the LORD? and who {is} a rock, save our God? 33. God {is} my strength {and} power: and he maketh my way perfect. {maketh: Heb. riddeth, or, looseth} 34. He maketh my feet like hinds' {feet}: and setteth me upon my high places. {maketh: Heb. equalleth} 35. He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. {to war: Heb. for the war} 36. Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. {made...: Heb. multiplied me} 37. Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip. {feet: Heb. ankles} 38. I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them. 39. And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet. 40. For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me. {subdued: Heb. caused to bow} 41. Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me. 42. They looked, but {there was} none to save; {even} unto the LORD, but he answered them not. 43. Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, {and} did spread them abroad. 44. Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me {to be} head of the heathen: a people {which} I knew not shall serve me. 45. Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me. {Strangers: Heb. Sons of the stranger} {submit...: or, yield feigned obedience: Heb. lie} 46. Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places. 47. The LORD liveth; and blessed {be} my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. 48. It {is} God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me, {avengeth: Heb. giveth avengement for} 49. And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. 50. Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name. 51. {He is} the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 231. So, like, these are David's final words. David, son of Jesse, was like, super legit. He was chosen by the God of Jacob and his rhymes were pure fire. Here's what he had to say: 2. Yo, the Spirit of the LORD spoke through me, and his word was like, on point in my tongue. 3. The God of Israel was like, 'Yo, listen up! The Rock of Israel talked to me and said that whoever's in charge of people should totally be fair and treat everyone with respect for God. Like, ruling with justice and fear of God, you know? Oh, and check this out, 'Be thou ruler, etc'. 4. And he'll be like the lit morning, when the sun pops up, a sunny morning without clouds; like the fresh grass sprouting out of the ground after a refreshing rain. 5. My crib may not be blessed by the divine vibes, but God is still keeping it real with me. He's hooked me up with an everlasting contract that's totally on point, no cap. That's my ultimate salvation and what I'm all about, even if things don't always go according to plan. 6. But all those worthless people will be like annoying thorns, too difficult to handle or control. 7. But whoever comes close to them better be armed with iron and a spear, because they're gonna get totally roasted by fire right where they stand! 8. These are the names of the super cool dudes that David hung out with: The Tachmonite who was totally the boss and sat in a high position among the captains; his real name was Adino the Eznite, and get this, he straight up took out 800 guys with his spear all at once. And just so you know, Tachmonite or Joshebbassebet, whichever name you prefer, was the leader of the three badasses. And those guys he defeated? Yeah, he totally annihilated them. Just saying. 9. And then there was Eleazar, Dodo's son from Ahohite squad, one of the top three warriors with David. They faced off against a bunch of Philistines who were ready to fight, while the rest of the Israelite soldiers had given up and left: 10. He got up and totally wrecked the Philistines until his hand got tired and stuck to the sword. And God brought about a huge win that day. After that, the people only stuck around to grab the loot. 11. Next up was Shammah, son of Agee the Hararite. So the Philistines decided to show up in full force, taking over a piece of land that was loaded with lentils. And let me tell you, everyone started booking it as soon as they saw the Philistines coming. They weren't ready for that battle! 12. But he flexed right in the center, totally defended the place, and straight up defeated all the Philistines. And you won't even believe it, but the LORD totally made it happen, like, major victory vibes all around. 13. So, three of the top thirty dudes decided to join David during harvest in this sick cave called Adullam. Meanwhile, the Philistines set up camp in the valley of Rephaim. No biggie. 14. So David was chilling in a fortress, while the Philistines were posted up in Bethlehem at that time. 15. David was like, bruh I really want a sip of that water from the well in Bethlehem, you know, the one by the gate! 16. So, like, these three absolute legends went full beast mode and straight up breached the Philistines' defenses. They even managed to get their hands on some water from the well in Bethlehem, right by the entrance, and brought it to David. But David, being the humble dude he is, didn't drink it. Instead, he offered it as an offering to the LORD. 17. Bro, no way am I gonna do this, Lord! This drink is like the blood of those dudes who risked their lives for it! I'm not touching it. These three epic dudes did all this stuff. 18. Abishai, Joab's bro, Zeruiah's son, was the boss of the top three warriors. He straight up took his spear and wrecked three hundred dudes, earning major respect as one of the three. Killed 'em all. And everyone was like, whoa. 19. Yo, wasn't he, like, the most legit out of the three? So, he was their boss and all, but didn't quite make it to the top three. 20. And this dude named Benaiah, who came from the legendary town of Kabzeel, was a real badass. He had done some insane stuff, like taking down two Moabite dudes who were as fierce as lions. Oh, and get this, he even went down into a freaking pit during a snowstorm and killed a lion. Talk about epic! 21. So this guy totally took out this Egyptian dude who looked pretty impressive. The Egyptian had this fancy spear in his hand, but the guy just rolls up with a staff, snatches the spear from the Egyptian, and straight up finishes him off with his own weapon. Like, he totally owned him! Oh, and by the way, that Egyptian dude, he was a total towering giant or something, if you're into the specifics. 22. Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, totally slayed it and became a real legend among the top three warriors. 23. He was well respected, but he didn't make it to the top three. David appointed him as leader of his crew. 24. Yo, Asahel, Joab's bro, was part of the squad of thirty; Elhanan, Dodo's son from Bethlehem, 25. Shammah and Elika from Harod, 26. Helez, the Paltite, and Ira, the son of Ikkesh from Tekoa, 27. Abiezer from Anethoth, Mebunnai from Hushath 28. Zalmon, the ultimate Ahohite, and Maharai, the legendary Netophathite, 29. Heleb, the son of Baanah, a cool Netophathite, Ittai, the son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjamin squad, 30. Yo, Benaiah from Pirathon, Hiddai of the sick Gaash vibes, you feel me? 31. Abialbon, the cool Arbathite, and Azmaveth, the Barhumite squad member, 32. Eliahba from the fam of Shaalbon, repping the Jashen squad, Jonathan be his homie, 33. Shammah da Hararite, Ahiam, Sharar da Hararite's kid, 34. Eliphelet, who was the son of Ahasbai, who was the son of the Maachathite. Also, Eliam, son of Ahithophel, who hailed from Gilon. 35. Hezrai from Carmel, Paarai from the Arbites, 36. Igal, Nathan's kid from Zobah, and Bani, the cool Gadite, 37. Zelek, the Ammonite 🛡️, Naharai from Beeroth, the rad sidekick of Joab, Zeruiah's son, 38. Ira, the cool Ithrite, and Gareb, another awesome Ithrite, 39. Uriah, the Hittite, had a total of thirty-seven. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 231. Now these {be} the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man {who was} raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said, 2. The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word {was} in my tongue. 3. The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men {must be} just, ruling in the fear of God. {He...: or, Be thou ruler, etc} 4. And {he shall be} as the light of the morning, {when} the sun riseth, {even} a morning without clouds; {as} the tender grass {springing} out of the earth by clear shining after rain. 5. Although my house {be} not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all {things}, and sure: for {this is} all my salvation, and all {my} desire, although he make {it} not to grow. 6. But {the sons} of Belial {shall be} all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands: 7. But the man {that} shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the {same} place. {fenced: Heb. filled} 8. These {be} the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same {was} Adino the Eznite: {he lift up his spear} against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. {The Tachmonite...: or, Joshebbassebet the Tachmonite, head of the three} {whom he...: Heb. slain} {he lift...: from (1ch:) whom he...: Heb. slain} 9. And after him {was} Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, {one} of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines {that} were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away: 10. He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil. 11. And after him {was} Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines. {into...: or, for foraging} 12. But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory. 13. And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim. {three...: or, the three captains over the thirty} 14. And David {was} then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines {was} then {in} Bethlehem. 15. And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which {is} by the gate! 16. And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that {was} by the gate, and took {it}, and brought {it} to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD. 17. And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: {is not this} the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men. 18. And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, {and} slew {them}, and had the name among three. {and slew them: Heb. slain} 19. Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the {first} three. 20. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow: {who...: Heb. great of acts} {lionlike...: Heb. lion of God} 21. And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. {a goodly...: Heb. a man of countenance, or, sight: also called, a man of great stature} 22. These {things} did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men. 23. He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the {first} three. And David set him over his guard. {more...: or, honourable among the thirty} {guard: or, council: Heb. at his command} 24. Asahel the brother of Joab {was} one of the thirty; Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 25. Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite, 26. Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, 27.

Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Samuel 241. So, like, God got super mad at Israel again, and he made David feel a strong urge to be like, 'Hey, go count all the peeps in Israel and Judah.' 2. So the king told Joab, the leader of his army, who was by his side, 'Yo, go and check out all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and count all the people. I wanna know the total headcount, ya know?' 3. And Joab was like, yo king, may the LORD your God increase the people like a hundred times, no matter how many there are, so that my lord the king can witness it. But, like, why is the king so into this? 4. But the king totally overruled Joab and the crew, so they bounced. They dipped out from the king's presence and decided to do a headcount of the peeps in Israel. 5. So they crossed the Jordan River and set up camp in Aroer, on the cool side of the city that's right in the middle of the Gad River, towards Jazer. 6. After that, they traveled to Gilead and the land of Tahtimhodshi. They also made their way to Danjaan and almost reached Zidon, which is known as the newly inhabited nether land. 7. Then they reached the fortress of Tyre and visited all the cities inhabited by the Hivites and Canaanites. They traveled south to Beersheba in Judah. 8. So, like, after totally exploring the whole land, they finally arrived in Jerusalem after, like, nine months and twenty days. 9. So Joab went and told the king how many warriors there were in Israel: 800k badass sword-wielding dudes, and in Judah, there were 500k dudes. 10. And David's heart felt guilty when he decided to count the people. David said to the LORD, 'I messed up big time with what I did. Now, I beg you, O LORD, please forgive your servant; I acted really foolishly.' 11. So like, when David woke up in the morning, he got this message from the LORD through the prophet Gad, who was like David's personal seer, and the message was like, 12. Yo, go tell David this message from the LORD: I got three options for you, pick one and I'll make it happen for ya. 13. So Gad pulled up on David and was like, 'Yo, listen up! You got three options, my dude. Option one: you down to deal with a seven-year famine in your land? Option two: you tryna dip for three months while your enemies chase after you? Option three: you cool with three days of straight-up plague in your land? Now, give me some advice and let me know what I should tell the one who sent me.' 14. And David was like, dude, I'm in a major pickle right now. So, let's just go ahead and trust in the Lord's total awesomeness and goodness, 'cause He's got mad love and mercy. And please, I beg you, don't let me end up at the mercy of any human. Like, not cool, man. 15. So God totally unleashed a massive plague on Israel, like OMG from morning until the end of the day. And, can you believe it? Seventy thousand dudes died, like, from Dan all the way to Beersheba. It was, like, a serious catastrophe. 16. And like, when the angel dude reached out his hand to wreck Jerusalem, the LORD was like, 'Nah, my bad, let's not do this,' and told the angel bro who was causing all the destruction, 'Stop right there, that's enough.' So the angel of the LORD was chilling near the threshing area of Araunah the Jebusite. (P.S. Araunah is also known as Ornan, just FYI) 17. So David was like, 'Yo, God, I gotta talk to you real quick. I saw this angel straight up punishing the people and I gotta admit, I messed up big time. I did some seriously messed up stuff. But like, these innocent sheep, man, they didn't do anything wrong. So could you, like, put your wrath on me and my whole family instead? I'm just tryna take responsibility here.' 18. So, like, Gad rolled up to David one day and was like, 'Bro, you gotta go and set up a sick altar for the LORD on Araunah the Jebusite's threshing floor. It's gonna be lit, trust me!' 19. So David, like Gad said, went up as the LORD commanded. 20. Araunah peeped and spotted the king and his crew heading his way. So Araunah stepped out, totally respectful, and bowed down to the king, face planted on the ground. 21. Araunah's like, yo what's up, why you here king? And David's straight up like, I'm here to cop your threshingfloor and build an altar for the LORD to stop the plague from messing with the people. 22. So Araunah was like, 'Yo David, go ahead and do whatever you think is cool, king! Check it out, I got some dope oxen for burnin' sacrifices, and there are also some sick threshing tools and stuff from the oxen that you can use for firewood.' 23. Araunah, the king, gave all these things to the king. And Araunah said to the king, 'May the LORD your God bless you.' 24. And the king was like, no way, but I'll totally purchase it from you, bro, for a fair price. I ain't about to offer some cheap sacrifice to the LORD my God, it's gotta cost me something, ya know? So David bought the sick spot and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. 25. Then David was like, 'Yo, I'ma build an altar for the Lord right here!' And he made hella burnt offerings and peace offerings. And you know what? The Lord totally listened and stopped the plague from messing with Israel. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Samuel 241. And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah. 2. For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which {was} with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people. {Go: or, Compass} 3. And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the eyes of my lord the king may see {it}: but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing? 4. Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel. 5. And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that {lieth} in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer: {river: or, valley} 6. Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon, {land of Tahtimhodshi: or, nether land newly inhabited} 7. And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the south of Judah, {even} to Beersheba. 8. So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 9. And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah {were} five hundred thousand men. 10. And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. 11. For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying, 12. Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three {things}; choose thee one of them, that I may {do it} unto thee. 13. So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me. 14. And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies {are} great: and let me not fall into the hand of man. {are great: or, are many} 15. So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men. 16. And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite. {Araunah: also called, Ornan} 17. And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house. 18. And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the Jebusite. {Araunah: Heb. Araniah} 19. And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD commanded. 20. And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground. 21. And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people. 22. And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what {seemeth} good unto him: behold, {here be} oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and {other} instruments of the oxen for wood. 23. All these {things} did Araunah, {as} a king, give unto the king. And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee. 24. And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy {it} of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. 25. And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 11. So, like, King David was like super old and just really frail, you know? They tried to keep him warm by covering him with clothes, but dude was just cold all the time. Like, his body couldn't generate any heat or something. It's like he was really advanced in years and stuff. 2. So his homies said to him, yo, we gotta find a fresh young babe for my boy the king. She gonna stand by his side, show him love and be his bae. Like, they gonna get cozy together so my boy the king can feel the fire. 3. So they were searching for a hot girl all over Israel, and stumbled upon Abishag, a total babe from Shunem, and brought her to the king. 4. And the girl was super attractive, and she was really into the king, and took care of him and served him. But the king didn't hook up with her. 5. So Adonijah, Haggith's son, thought he could totally be the king. He flexed by getting himself some sick chariots, horsemen, and even fifty dudes to hype him up. #RoyalGoals #Reign 6. And his dad never got mad at him and asked, 'Why'd you do that?' He was a really good-looking guy too, and his mom had him after Absalom. 7. And he talked with Joab, son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. They teamed up with Adonijah and supported him. 8. But Zadok the priest, Benaiah (Jehoiada's son), Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's awesome squad were not rollin' with Adonijah. 9. And Adonijah killed some dope sheep and oxen and thicc cattle near this lit spot called Zoheleth, right next to Enrogel. He gathered all his bros, who were the king's sons, and all the homies from Judah who worked for the king. Enrogel was like a sick well, by the way, also known as the well Rogel. 10. But Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, the epic warriors, and Solomon, his bro, he didn't even reach out to them. 11. So, like, Nathan goes up to Bathsheba, Solomon's mom, and he's like, 'Yo, have you not heard that Adonijah, Haggith's son, is lowkey ruling, and our main man David has no clue?' 12. So, like, listen up now. I'm about to drop some wisdom on you. It's important if you wanna save your own life and your son Solomon's life too, you know what I'm saying? 13. Yo, go find King David and be like, 'Bro, didn't you swear to me, your loyal servant, that Solomon, your son, would be the next king? So why is Adonijah ruling instead?' 14. Yo, listen up. While you're still chatting it up with the king, I'm gonna slide in right after you and back you up, making your words even stronger. {confirm: Heb. fill up} 15. So Bathsheba entered the king's chamber, and, like, the king was like super old, you know? And this girl named Abishag from Shunem was, like, taking care of the king and stuff. 16. Bathsheba was respectful and bowed down to the king. And the king asked, 'What's up? What can I do for you?' 17. And she was like, 'Dude, you made a promise to me, swearin' by the LORD your God, that Solomon, your son, would totally become king after me and take over my throne.' 18. Yo, listen up, Adonijah is totally in charge now. And, like, King, you have no clue about it, okay? 19. So, he's like totally slaughtered a ton of oxen, fat cattle, and sheep, and he's gathered all the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the leader of the army. But he hasn't invited your buddy Solomon, man. 20. Yo, King, all of Israel is watching you! They wanna know who's gonna take the throne after you, my dude. 21. If my king, like, dies and stuff, me and my boy Solomon will be labeled as troublemakers. (troublemakers: Hebrew for sinners) 22. And OMG, as she was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. 23. So, they were like, 'Yo, the king, Nathan the prophet is here!' And when Nathan came in, he straight up bowed down and put his face on the ground, showing mad respect for the king. 24. And Nathan was like, yo king, did you say Adonijah's gonna rule after me and take my throne? 25. Yo, this dude went all out today! He's straight up slayed a ton of oxen, fat cattle, and sheep. Plus, he's gathered all the king's sons, the captains of the crew, and Abiathar the priest. They're feasting it up and shouting, 'Long live King Adonijah!' 26. But like, yo, even I, your homie, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and your boy Solomon, haven't been summoned or anything. 27. Did my dude the king do this without telling your homie who's supposed to be the next king after him? 28. So King David was like, 'Yo, bring Bathsheba here.' And she rolled up to the king's crib, standing in front of him and all. 29. And the king was like, dude, I swear on everything that's epic and amazing, the LORD is legit and has totally saved me from all the messed up situations! 30. Like, I promised you before the LORD God of Israel, for real, that Solomon your son is totally gonna be the next king after me. He'll like, literally sit on my throne and everything. And guess what? Today, I'm absolutely gonna make it happen, no doubt. 31. Bathsheba straight up bowed down to the ground, showing respect to the king, and said, 'Long live my lord, King David, forever.' 32. So, like King David was all, 'Yo, get Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the homie, son of Jehoiada. And they came and stood in front of the king, ya know? 33. Yo, listen up! The king told them, 'Grab your lord's servants, and let Solomon, my son, ride on my sick mule. Take him down to Gihon ASAP. It's mine, ya feel me?' 34. So, Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet should totally declare him king of Israel, and you guys should blast the trumpet and shout, Godd save King Solomon!' 35. So, like, once he's done, you should totally come up and take his spot on the throne. 'Cause, like, you're gonna be the new king in my place, and I've totally picked you to be the ruler over Israel and Judah. 36. And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, responded to the king, and he was like, 'For real, dude! The LORD God of my lord, the king, totally agrees, yo.' 37. Just like the LORD has been with my lord the king, let him also be with Solomon, and make his throne even more epic than my lord king David's throne. 38. Then Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah (Jehoiada's son), the Cherethites, and the Pelethites all went down and made Solomon ride on King David's mule, and led him to Gihon. 39. So, like, this priest dude named Zadok grabbed a bottle of oil from the fancy tent and poured it all over Solomon. Then, they started hella blowing the trumpet and all the people were like, 'Yo, God bless king Solomon!' 40. And everyone followed him, jamming out on their instruments, and celebrated like there was no tomorrow! The noise they made was so hype that it shook the ground. 41. Adonijah and all his squad heard it while they were finished grubbing. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he was like, yo, why is the whole city tripping? 42. And as he was still talking, bro, Jonathan, Abiathar's son and the priest, pulled up. Adonijah was like, 'Yo, come on in! You're a total legend and you bring awesome news!' 43. And Jonathan was like, dude, Adonijah, for real, our king David made Solomon the boss king. 44. So the king sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites to accompany him, and they made him ride on the king's mule. 45. So like, Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet just made him king in Gihon, and they're all hyped as they come back to the city, so it's like a crazy celebration going on. That's the sound that y'all are hearing. 46. And yo, Solomon is chillaxin' on the throne, ruling the kingdom. 47. And the king's squad came to give props to our boy King David, saying, May the man Solomon flex a better rep than you, and may his throne be bigger than your throne. And the king showed mad respect by bowing on his bed. 48. And like, the king was like, 'Yo, praise the LORD God of Israel, man! He's hooked me up with someone to rule on my throne today, and bro, I totally saw it with my own eyes! 🙌👑 49. And all of Adonijah's crew got shook, bounced and scattered. 50. Adonijah got scared of Solomon, so he hopped up, went out, and grabbed onto the altar's horns. 51. So, Solomon got a message that basically said, 'Yo, check it out, Adonijah is scared of you, bro. He's freaking clutching onto the altar like his life depends on it, begging you to pinky swear that you won't go all sword-wielding crazy and kill him today.' 52. Solomon was like, if this dude proves he's legit, not a single strand of his hair will be harmed. But if he turns out to be wicked, he's donezo. 53. So King Solomon was like, 'Yo, go get him from the altar.' And they brought him down and he came over, showed mad respect by bowing to King Solomon. Then Solomon was like, 'Bro, time for you to head back home.' \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 11. Now king David was old {and} stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat. {stricken...: Heb. entered into days} 2. Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. {Let there...: Heb. Let them seek} {a young...: Heb. a damsel, a virgin} {cherish...: Heb. be a cherisher unto him} 3. So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 4. And the damsel {was} very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not. 5. Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. {be king: Heb. reign} 6. And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also {was a} very goodly {man}; and {his mother} bare him after Absalom. {at any...: Heb. from his days} 7. And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped {him}. {he...: Heb. his words were with} {following...: Heb. helped after Adonijah} 8. But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which {belonged} to David, were not with Adonijah. 9. And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which {is} by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants: {Enrogel: or, the well Rogel} 10. But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not. 11. Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth {it} not? 12. Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 13. Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign? 14. Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words. {confirm: Heb. fill up} 15. And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king. 16. And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou? {What...: Heb. What to thee?} 17. And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, {saying}, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne. 18. And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest {it} not: 19. And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called. 20. And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel {are} upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 21. Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders. {offenders: Heb. sinners} 22. And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in. 23. And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground. 24. And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? 25. For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah. {God...: Heb. Let king Adonijah live} 26. But me, {even} me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called. 27. Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed {it} unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him? 28. Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king. {into...: Heb. before the king} 29. And the king sware, and said, {As} the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress, 30. Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day. 31. Then Bathsheba bowed with {her} face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever. 32. And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. 33. The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon: {mine...: Heb. which belongeth to me} 34. And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon. 35. Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. 36. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so {too}. 37. As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David. 38. So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon. 39. And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon. 40. And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them. {pipes: or, flutes} 41. And Adonijah and all the guests that {were} with him heard {it} as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore {is this} noise of the city being in an uproar? 42. And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou {art} a valiant man, and bringest good tidings. 43. And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king. 44. And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule: 45. And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This {is} the noise that ye have heard. 46. And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 47. And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed. 48. And also thus said the king, Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel, which hath given {one} to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing {it}. 49. And all the guests that {were} with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way. 50. And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 51. And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword. 52. And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die. 53. So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 21. So like, the time was getting close for David to pass away, and he gave Solomon, his son, some super important instructions, you know what I'm saying? 2. I'm about to kick the bucket like everyone else: so, like, man up and show some real strength! 3. Make sure you obey the rules of the LORD your God and follow his ways, keeping all his laws, commandments, judgments, and testimonies that are written in the law of Moses. By doing this, you'll succeed in everything you do and wherever you go. {succeed: or, be wise} 4. So basically, God's like, 'Yo, I'm gonna make sure my promise to you stays legit, bro. If your fam stays on point, walking in truth with their whole being, I promise you won't be lacking a king ruling over Israel. Like, seriously, no one's gonna snatch that away from you.' 5. Also, you're aware of all the messed up stuff Joab did to me, right? He straight up killed Abner and Amasa, who were high-ranking dudes in Israel's army! And get this, he spilled their blood even when there wasn't a dang war going on. He was so ruthless, he stained his belt and shoes with their blood like some sick trophy. 6. So, like, use your smarts and make sure his gray hair doesn't rest in peace when he kicks the bucket. 7. Yo, be cool to the dudes from Barzillai's fam, the Gileadites, and let 'em chill at your table, 'cause they had my back when I bounced 'cause of your brother Absalom. 8. Yo, check it out, you still got Shimei, Gera's son, a Benjamite from Bahurim, who seriously cursed me over at Mahanaim. But when I got to the Jordan, he came to meet me, and I made a promise to him in the name of the LORD, saying, I won't kill you with a sword, bro. Word. 9. So like, don't just let him slide, dude. You're totally wise and know exactly what you should do to him. But make sure he pays for his wrongs, even if it means taking him down to the grave with just retribution. 10. After living a full life, David passed away and was laid to rest in the city of David. 11. So, David was in charge of Israel for a whole 40 years. He started his reign in Hebron and ruled there for 7 years. Then, he moved to Jerusalem and ruled for another 33 years. 12. So Solomon slid into David's throne, a total power move, and his kingdom was totally lit, like, it was on another level. 13. So Adonijah, Haggith's son, went to meet Solomon's mom, Bathsheba. And she was like, 'Are you here to cause any trouble?' And he was like, 'Nah, just chillin'. 14. He was like, 'Yo, I got something to tell you.' And she was like, 'Spill the tea!' 15. And he was like, you know that the kingdom used to be mine, and, like, all of Israel was supporting me to be the ruler. But, like, things have totally flipped, and now the kingdom belongs to my bro because the Big Guy upstairs said so. 16. So like, I've got this one favor to ask. Please don't say no. And she's all like, 'Yeah, sure, spill it.' 17. So, like, he was all, 'Dude, please talk to King Solomon and ask him for me, because he totally won't refuse, to let me marry Abishag the Shunammite.' 18. And Bathsheba was like, okay, I gotchu fam, I'll go talk to the king for you. 19. So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk to him about Adonijah. When the king saw her, he got up, greeted her, and took a seat on his throne. He even arranged for a chair to be set up for his mom, who sat on his right side. 20. So she's like, I've got this small request, pretty pretty please don't deny me. And the king's like, Sure, go ahead, mom! I won't say no to you. 21. And she was like, yo, give Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah, your bro, as his wife, you know? 22. Yo, listen up, Queen Mother! Why are you going to Abishag the Shunammite to ask for Adonijah? If you want, just go ahead and ask for the whole kingdom! 'Cause guess what? He's my older bro, so he's got a claim too, along with Abiathar the priest and Joab, son of Zeruiah. 23. And like, King Solomon literally swears by the LORD, and he's all like, Godd better do all sorts of crazy stuff to me, like seriously intense stuff, if Adonijah didn't say this thing that's gonna totally mess up his life.' 24. So, like, I swear to God, the Almighty One who made me king and put me on the throne that belonged to my dad David, and who fulfilled the promise of giving me a palace; today, Adonijah will totally face death. 25. So King Solomon sent Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, to take care of business, and let's just say things didn't end well for the guy. 26. The king told Abiathar the priest, 'Go to Anathoth and tend to your own land. You deserve to die, but I won't kill you now because you served in front of God's ark for my father David and went through all the hardships he endured.' 27. So Solomon kicked Abiathar out from being a priest for the LORD, to make sure that what the LORD said about Eli's family in Shiloh would happen. 28. So Joab heard the news because he was hanging out with Adonijah, not with Absalom. Joab got scared and ran to the LORD's hangout spot, grabbing onto the altar for dear life. 29. So, like, word got to King Solomon that Joab escaped to the sacred place of the LORD, and guess what, he's chillin' right by the altar. So, Solomon's like, 'Yo, Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, go get him!' 30. So Benaiah went to the place where God was chilling, and he was like, 'Yo, the King wants you to come out.' But the guy was like, 'Nah, I'm staying here and I'm ready to die.' Then Benaiah went back to the King and was like, 'This is what Joab said, and this is how he responded to me.' 31. Then the king was like, 'Yeah, do what he said and tackle him, bury him and all. We gotta make sure to clear Joab's name from spilling innocent blood on me and my fam.' 32. And God will make him pay for what he did by making him suffer. He attacked two guys who were way cooler and righteous than him, and straight up murdered them. My dad David had no idea about any of this, just to be clear. The dudes he killed were Abner, the boss of Israel's army, and Amasa, the boss of Judah's army. 33. So Joab and his descendants will bear the responsibility for their actions, paying for it with their own blood. But as for David, his descendants, his household, and his throne, they will enjoy everlasting peace bestowed by the LORD. 34. Then Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, went up and took him out, killing him. They buried him in his own crib out in the middle of nowhere. 35. The king chose Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, to take charge of his army, and Zadok the priest replaced Abiathar. 36. So the king reached out to Shimei and was like, 'Yo bro, go ahead and build yourself a sick pad in Jerusalem. Settle down there and don't even think about bouncing out.' 37. Listen up, when you leave and cross over the Kidron brook, you better believe you're heading straight for doom. Your own blood will be on your hands, no doubt about it. 38. Shimei was like, 'Yo, the king's words are straight fire. Whatever my lord the king commanded, your boy Shimei got you. And Shimei chilled in Jerusalem for a hot minute. 39. So, after three years, two of Shimei's servants decided to dip and bounced to Achish, son of Maachah, the king of Gath. They hit up Shimei like, 'Yo, bro, guess where your servants are? Gath, man!' 40. So Shimei got up and hopped on his ride, headed to Gath to find his crew. Shimei went, and managed to bring his squad back from Gath. 41. So, like, word got to Solomon that Shimei, you know, had dipped from Jerusalem to Gath and then pulled a U-turn. 42. So the king texts Shimei and says, 'Bro, remember when I made you swear by the LORD and warned you that if you ever leave or go anywhere, you'll definitely die? And you were like, 'Yeah man, I got it, the word I heard sounds good'. 43. So like, why didn't you keep your promise to the LORD and do what I told you to? 44. The king straight up told Shimei, like, you know all the messed up stuff you did to my dad David, right? Well, let me break it down for you: God's gonna totally make you pay for all your wickedness, like, it's gonna come back and bite you in the end, man. 45. King Solomon gonna be blessed, and David's throne gonna stay strong in front of the LORD forever. 46. Then the king told Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, to go and take care of him. Benaiah did as he was told and ended up finishing the guy off, so he kicked the bucket. And that's how Solomon became the boss of the kingdom. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 21. Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged Solomon his son, saying, 2. I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man; 3. And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself: {prosper: or, do wisely} 4. That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee saidd he) a man on the throne of Israel. {fail...: Heb. be cut off from thee from the throne} 5. Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, {and} what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that {was} about his loins, and in his shoes that {were} on his feet. {shed: Heb. put} 6. Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. 7. But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother. 8. And, behold, {thou hast} with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword. {grievous: Heb. strong} 9. Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou {art} a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood. 10. So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 11. And the days that David reigned over Israel {were} forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem. 12. Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly. 13. And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. 14. He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on. 15. And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and {that} all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD. 16. And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on. {deny...: Heb. turn not away my face} 17. And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. 18. And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king. 19. Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand. 20. Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; {I pray thee}, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay. 21. And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife. 22. And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he {is} mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. 23. Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. 24. Now therefore, {as} the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. 25. And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died. 26. And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou {art} worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. {worthy...: Heb. a man of death} 27. So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. 28. Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar. 29. And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, {he is} by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. 30. And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me. 31. And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father. 32. And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing {thereof, to wit}, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah. 33. Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD. 34. So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. 35. And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar. 36. And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. 37. For it shall be, {that} on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head. 38. And Shimei said unto the king, The saying {is} good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days. 39. And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants {be} in Gath. 40. And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. 41. And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again. 42. And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word {that} I have heard {is} good. 43. Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with? 44. The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; 45. And king Solomon {shall be} blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever. 46. So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 31. So Solomon hit it off with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and started dating Pharaoh's daughter. He brought her back to the city of David while he finished building his own crib, the temple for the LORD, and the walls of Jerusalem all around. 2. Back in the day, peeps used to do their sacrifices on the high places since there wasn't a legit house built in the name of the LORD at that time. 3. Solomon was totally devoted to the LORD and followed in the footsteps of his father David, but he sometimes went all out with sacrifices and incense at the cool hangout spots. 4. So the king headed to Gibeon to make sacrifices there, because it was a major holy spot. Solomon went all out and made a whopping thousand burnt offerings on that altar. 5. So, like, one night, God made this total appearance to Solomon in a dream in Gibeon, right? And God was all like, 'Yo, ask me whatever you want and I'll hook you up, bro!' 6. And Solomon was like, yo, you totally showed my dad, David, mad love by giving him all that mercy and being real with him. He stayed true to you, always walking in truth, righteousness, and keeping it real with you. And you even blessed him with a son to take over his throne, which is still happening right now. It's all about that kindness, man. 7. And now, yo God, you've made me king instead of my pops David. And to be real, I'm just a lil' kid. I don't even know how to step out or come in. 8. And your servant is, like, totally chillin' with your chosen peeps, who are, like, a massive squad that, legit, can't even be counted or put a number on. 9. So, like, God, can you just bless me with some serious wisdom? I need to be able to tell right from wrong when I'm dealing with your awesome squad. I mean, who has the skills to handle such a rad group of people, am I right? 10. And God was totally stoked with what Solomon asked, it made Him happy AF. 11. And God said to him, yo, because you asked for this and didn't ask for like a super long life or riches or anything like that, and you didn't even ask for the harm of your enemies, but you asked for understanding to make good judgments, like that's legit cool of you, man. 12. Listen up, I've totally delivered what you asked for - check it out, I've hooked you up with a brain that's wise and full of understanding. No one in the past or future will even come close to matching your greatness. 13. I've totally hooked you up with things you didn't even ask for, like mad stacks of cash and mad respect, yo. Ain't nobody gonna be as gnarly as you, ruling the kings game forever. {shall...: or, hath not been} 14. And, like, if you're down to follow my vibes, keeping it real with my rules and stuff, just like your homie David did, then I'll hook you up with a nice long life, no cap. 15. So Solomon woke up and realized it was all just a dream. Then he went to Jerusalem and stood in front of the ark of the LORD's covenant. He offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and threw a big feast for all his homies. 16. So, like, these two women, who everyone knew were, like, sex workers or whatever, they came to the king and, like, stood right in front of him. 17. So, like, this one woman was like, 'Yo, dude, me and this chick live together and we both had babies in the same house.' 18. So, like, three days after I had given birth, this other lady also gave birth. And we were there together, like, just the two of us in the house. There was nobody else around, you know. 19. And like, this lady's baby passed away during the night 'cause she accidentally laid on top of it or something. 20. So, like, in the middle of the night, she got up and snatched my kid from next to me, while I was knocked out, and put him in her arms, then put her lifeless baby in my arms. 21. So, when I woke up in the morning to feed my baby, I was shocked to find out that the little one had passed away. But as I took a closer look in the morning, I realized that the baby lying there was not my own, the one I gave birth to. 22. Then one of them spoke up and said, 'No, the baby who is alive is my child, and the baby who is dead is yours.' But the other one argued, 'No way, the dead baby is yours and the alive baby is mine.' They kept on arguing like this in front of the king. 23. Then the king was like, one person is claiming 'This is my living child and yours is the deceased one', and the other person is saying, 'No way! Your child is the dead one and mine is the one who's alive'. 24. Then the king's like, yo, get me a sword. So they brought a sword to the king and all. 25. So the king was like, 'Yo, let's cut the baby in half and give each of them a piece.' 26. So this woman, who was the real mother of the child, spoke up to the king. She had such a strong love for her son that it felt like her heart was burning inside. She pleaded, 'Oh my lord, please give her the child and don't let anyone harm him.' But the other woman insisted, 'Let's just cut the child in half and share him.' 27. So, like, the king was all like, 'Yo, just give her the baby, don't even think about killing it. She's totally the real mom, man.' 28. When everyone in Israel found out about the king's fair judgment, they were in awe of him because they could see that God had blessed him with wisdom and good judgment. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 31. And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about. 2. Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days. 3. And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. 4. And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that {was} the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar. 5. In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee. 6. And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as {it is} this day. {mercy: or, bounty} 7. And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I {am but} a little child: I know not {how} to go out or come in. 8. And thy servant {is} in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. 9. Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people? {understanding: Heb. hearing} 10. And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. 11. And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment; {long life: Heb. many days} {discern: Heb. hear} 12. Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. 13. And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. {shall...: or, hath not been} 14. And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days. 15. And Solomon awoke; and, behold, {it was} a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. 16. Then came there two women, {that were} harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. 17. And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. 18. And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we {were} together; {there was} no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. 19. And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it. 20. And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 21. And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear. 22. And the other woman said, Nay; but the living {is} my son, and the dead {is} thy son. And this said, No; but the dead {is} thy son, and the living {is} my son. Thus they spake before the king. 23. Then said the king, The one saith, This {is} my son that liveth, and thy son {is} the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son {is} the dead, and my son {is} the living. 24. And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. 25. And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. 26. Then spake the woman whose the living child {was} unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, {but} divide {it}. {yearned: Heb. were hot} 27. Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she {is} the mother thereof. 28. And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God {was} in him, to do judgment. {in him: Heb. in the midst of him} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 41. So, like, King Solomon was, like, the ruler of all Israel, you know. 2. And these were the top dudes he had; Azariah, the son of Zadok the priest, you know, the big boss of the priests. 3. Elihoreph and Ahiah, Shisha's kids who were really good at writing stuff down; Jehoshaphat, Ahilud's son, the expert at keeping records. {scribes: or, secretaries} {recorder: or, remembrancer} 4. Benaiah, Jehoiada's kid, was in charge of the squad, while Zadok and Abiathar held it down as the priests. 5. Azariah, Nathan's son, was in charge of the officers, while Zabud, another one of Nathan's sons, held the important position of the king's right-hand man and close friend. 6. Ahishar was in charge of running the household, and Adoniram, Abda's son, was responsible for collecting taxes. 7. So, like Solomon had these twelve squad leaders running the show in Israel. They were in charge of making sure the king and his fam were all well-fed and taken care of. Each officer would take turns, one month at a time, to handle all the food and supplies. 8. And these are their names: The son of Hur, in chill mount Ephraim: Benhur 9. The dude named Dekar's offspring be ruling over Makaz, Shaalbim, Bethshemesh, and Elonbethhanan. Bendekar might be involved too. Like, he might be Dekar's son or something. 10. Hesed's son was in charge of Aruboth. He had control over Sochoh and all the land of Hepher. 11. Abinadab's son was in charge of the whole Dor area. He was married to Taphath, Solomon's daughter. (By the way, Abinadab means Benabinadab) 12. Baana, the son of Ahilud, had control over Taanach, Megiddo, and all of Bethshean, which is located near Zartanah below Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, all the way to the area beyond Jokneam. 13. Geber's son was in charge of Ramothgilead. He owned the towns of Jair, Manasseh's son, in Gilead. He also had control over the region of Argob in Bashan. That place had a whopping sixty big cities with walls and metal bars. The son of Geber was a total boss at managing it all! 14. Iddo's son, Ahinadab, he was all about Mahanaim, you know - like, he was really into that place, Mahanaim. It was his jam, you know what I'm saying? Mahanaim all the way! 15. Ahimaaz was from Naphtali; he totally married Basmath, Solomon's daughter. #RelationshipGoals 16. Baanah, Hushai's kid, held it down in Asher and Aloth: 17. Jehoshaphat, Paruah's kid, repping Issachar: 18. Shimei, Elah's kid, reppin' Benjamin: 19. Geber, Uri's son, was in the land of Gilead, under the rule of Sihon, the Amorite king, and Og, the king of Bashan. He was the sole top dog in the whole land. 20. Judah and Israel had a massive squad, like the insane amount of sand by the sea. They were all about feasting, partying, and having a blast. 21. Solomon was the ruler of all the kingdoms, from the river to the land of the Philistines and all the way to the border of Egypt. People gave him gifts and served him faithfully throughout his entire life. 22. So, like, Solomon's daily food stash was, like, 30 loads of dope fine flour and 60 loads of meal, you know? #FeastGoals #BreadLife 23. I got ten thicc oxen, twenty oxen chillin' in the meadows, a whole hundred sheep, and not to mention some harts, roebucks, fallowdeer, and some top-tier fatted fowl. 24. Yo, this dude had complete control over all the land from Tiphsah to Azzah, ruling over all the kings in that area. And get this, he had mad peace going on, like, no drama anywhere around him. 25. So, like, Judah and Israel were just chillin', you know? Living their best lives without any worries. Each dude had his own spot, kicking back under his vine and fig tree. It was all good vibes from Dan to Beersheba, throughout Solomon's reign. They were straight up living confidently, you feel me? 26. So basically, Solomon was flexin' with like, forty thousand horse parking spots for his flashy chariots, and he had twelve thousand soldiers riding those horses. Talk about a serious horse game, dude. 27. And those high-ranking peeps kept the food game strong for King Solomon and all his homies at the royal feast, making sure everyone was well-fed every month. No one went hungry, fam. 28. They also brought barley and straw for the horses and dromedaries to the designated spot where the officers were stationed. Each person contributed according to their responsibilities. (Dromedaries can be understood as mules or swift beasts.) 29. God blessed Solomon with mad wisdom and understanding, like, literally so much, and his heart was, like, huge, bro, just like the sand on the beach. 30. Solomon was, like, the smartest out of everyone from the east and even those brainiacs from Egypt. 31. He was the ultimate wisdom flex, smarter than everyone: even Ethan, Heman, Chalcol, and Darda, the coolest guys out there. He was famous in all the nations around. Respect. 32. So basically, this dude dropped three thousand proverbs like they were hot and blessed us with a thousand and five sick tunes. 33. And he talked about trees, from the giant cedar trees in Lebanon all the way to the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He also talked about animals, birds, creepy crawlies, and fish. 34. So like, people from all over the place were flocked to hear Solomon's wisdom, even kings who had heard how insanely wise he was. \n",

      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 51. So Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent his peeps to Solomon because he heard that they crowned him as king, taking over from his dad. Hiram was always a big fan of David, ya know? (P.S. Hiram is also known as Huram.) 2. So Solomon DM'd Hiram, like, 3. Yo, you know how David, my pops, couldn't even build a crib for the Lord his God 'cause he was caught up in wars from all directions? But, the Lord helped him subdue his enemies, making them bow down under his feet. 4. But yo, God be hooking me up with mad chill vibes, makin' it all cool on all fronts, like no haters or drama disruptin' the flow. 5. Yo, check it out, I'm planning on building a sick crib for the Lord my God, just like He told my pops David. He said that my son, who's gonna take over my throne, is gonna be the one to build a house in His name. No cap, that's what He said. 6. So like, can you make sure that they cut down cedar trees from Lebanon? And then my crew will work with yours, ya know? I'll totally pay you for your peeps based on whatever you say, cause you're aware that none of us are skilled at cutting timber like the peeps from Sidon. 7. So, like, Hiram was stoked when he heard what Solomon said, and he was all like, 'Dude, the LORD totally blessed David today by giving him a super smart son to rule over this awesome nation!' 8. Yo, Solomon, just got your message from Hiram. I've totally checked out the stuff you need and I'm down to hook you up with all the cedar and fir timber you want. No worries, consider it done! 9. My crew will bring those goods from Lebanon to the coast. Then we'll ship them on cool floating vessels to the spot you choose. Once we reach the destination, we'll unload them and you'll receive everything. This way, I'll be able to fulfill my goal of providing food for my fam. (Note: 'appoint' means 'send' in Hebrew) 10. So Hiram hooked Solomon up with some mad cedar trees and fir trees, just like he wanted, ya know? 11. So Solomon hooked Hiram up with twenty thousand measures of wheat to keep his crew's stomachs satisfied, and twenty measures of top-notch oil. Solomon came through with the same deal for Hiram every year. (measures: Hebrew for 'cors') 12. So like, God totally hooked Solomon up with mad wisdom, just like He promised! And because of that, Solomon and Hiram were all chill with each other and even formed an alliance. 13. So King Solomon gathered a squad of thirty thousand dudes from all over Israel. (levy means they were basically compulsory recruits) 14. And he like, sent them to Lebanon, like ten thousand peeps per month on rotation: they stay in Lebanon for a whole month, and then they chill at home for two months. And Adoniram was in charge of the whole recruitment process, yo. 15. Solomon had 70,000 people carrying heavy stuff and 80,000 stone-cutters up in the mountains; 16. Yo, check it out, Solomon had about 3,300 boss officers in charge of all the work going on. They were the ones leading the people who were getting things done. 17. So the king was like, 'Yo, bring me some dope stones - the expensive kind, you know? And make sure they're all nice and carved, we gotta lay down a solid foundation for this house.' 18. So, like, Solomon's crew and Hiram's team were like totally carving those stones, you know, getting them all ready to build the house, man. They were all about that timber and those stones, you feel me? #BuilderGang \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 51. And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David. {Hiram: also called, Huram} 2. And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 3. Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. 4. But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, {so that there is} neither adversary nor evil occurrent. 5. And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name. {purpose: Heb. say} 6. Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that {there is} not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians. {appoint: Heb. say} 7. And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed {be} the LORD this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great people. 8. And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: {and} I will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. {considered: Heb. heard} 9. My servants shall bring {them} down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive {them}: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household. {appoint: Heb. send} 10. So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees {according to} all his desire. 11. And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat {for} food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. {measures: Heb. cors} 12. And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together. 13. And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men. {levy: Heb. tribute of men} 14. And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, {and} two months at home: and Adoniram {was} over the levy. 15. And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 16. Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which {were} over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work. 17. And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, {and} hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house. 18. And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew {them}, and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house. {stonesquares: or, Giblites} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 61. So, like, it happened around 480 years after the Israelites left Egypt, during Solomon's fourth year as king of Israel. It was in the month of Zif, which is the second month, when he started building the house of the LORD. 2. So King Solomon built this massive crib for the LORD, it was like 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits tall. That's a whole lot of space for God to chill in! 3. The entrance area in front of the temple was twenty cubits long, just as wide as the temple itself. And it was ten cubits wide, extending out from the front of the house. 4. And he put some really cool windows in the house. They were all sleek and modern, with a narrower design on the outside. #Aesthetic 5. He built rooms all around the walls of the house, both in the temple and in the sacred area. The rooms were connected to the wall and had multiple levels. 6. The lowest level was like 5 cubits wide, the middle level was like 6 cubits wide, and the top level was like 7 cubits wide. Along the sides of the house, there were special spaces made so the beams didn't have to be attached to the walls. 7. So, back when the house was being built, it was made with pre-cut stones. They brought these stones to the site, so there was no need for hammers, axes, or any iron tools to be used while the house was being built. 8. The entrance to the middle room was on the right side of the house. They used cool spiral stairs to go up to the middle room, and then from there, they moved to the third room. 9. So, like, he totally built the house and finished it, you know? And he covered the house with, like, beams and boards made out of super cool cedar. It was, like, top-notch craftsmanship, ya know? Oh, and the vault beams and panellings were also decked out in cedar, if you wanted to know. 10. So, like, he totally constructed these cool rooms all around the house, about five cubits high, ya know? And they were supported by cedar wood, how rad is that? 11. So God hit up Solomon and was like, 12. Hey, about this house you're building, if you're down to follow my rules, do what's right, and keep all my commands, then I'll totally keep my promise to your dad David and hook you up. 13. And I'll totally be chillin' with the peeps of Israel, like, I won't ever bail on my homies in Israel. 14. So Solomon totally constructed the crib and got it all decked out. 15. So he like totally constructed the walls of the crib with cedar planks. And the floor and the ceiling were all decked out with those same cedar vibes. On the inside, he added some more wood vibes, and covered the floor with some fancy fir planks. It was a whole process, from floor to walls and all that jazz. 16. And he made the sides of the house twenty cubits long, using cedar boards for both the floor and walls. He even crafted them inside the temple, specifically for the special room, which was the holiest place. 17. And the crib, like, the mega church in front of it, was 40 units long. 18. The inside of the house was totally decked out with groovy carved patterns and fresh flowers. Everything was made of cedar, no stone in sight. It was like those fancy gourd-shaped decorations and cool openings were giving it some extra flair, ya know? 19. And he made a special room inside the house for the ark of the LORD's promise to be placed there. 20. The thing upfront was 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 20 cubits tall. It was all blinged-out with pure gold, covering the cedar altar. 21. So like, Solomon totally decked out the inside of the house with legit gold: and he put up this gold chain divider thingy in front of the holy place; and he covered it all in gold. 22. And, like, the entire house was covered in gold, you know? It was like, super fancy. Oh, and they even gold-plated the whole altar that was by the oracle, too. So extra, but totally fabulous. 23. And inside the special room, he crafted two cherubims out of olive tree, each standing ten cubits tall. (Olive tree: or oily; the Hebrew word can be interpreted both ways). 24. And the wings of the cherub measured five cubits on one side and five cubits on the other side. The total wingspan of the cherub was ten cubits, stretching from one edge of the wing to the other. 25. And the other cool angel was like ten cubits, and both the angels were the same size and shape. 26. The cherubs were like 10 feet tall, both of them. 27. And he placed the cherubims inside the main room. They spread out their wings so that one wing touched one wall and the other wing of the cherub touched the opposite wall. Their wings met in the center of the room. 28. And he flexed the cherubims with mad gold bling. 29. And he totally flexed with those lit designs, carving mad cherubims, palm trees, and flowers all over the walls inside and out. You know, like, super dope open flowers and stuff. So fire, man. 🔥🌴 30. And he flexed on the house's floor, putting a sick layer of gold inside and out, no cap. 31. And like, for the entrance of the special room, he crafted these totally dope olive tree doors. The lintel and side posts were like one fifth of the wall. And by one fifth, I mean they were fivesquare. How rad is that? 32. The two doors were made of olive tree wood, and designs of cherubims, palm trees, and blooming flowers were carved onto them. They were then covered with gold, spreading gold on the cherubims and the palm trees. (two...: or, leaves of the doors) (open flowers: Heb. openings of flowers) 33. He also made posts for the entrance of the temple out of olive wood. The posts were one quarter the size of the wall, and they were shaped like a square. 34. Yo, check it out, the doors were made of fir tree. One door had two folding leaves, and the other door had two folding leaves too. 35. Then he designed these sick cherubims, palm trees, and lit flowers on it. And he flexed by covering them with gold to perfectly match the carving. 36. So, he like totally constructed the inner courtyard using these sick three rows of finely cut stone, and on top of that, he added a row of super trendy cedar beams. 37. In the fourth year, they started building the house of the LORD in the month Zif: 38. And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was totally finished, with all its parts and according to its unique style. It took a solid seven years to build it. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 61. And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which {is} the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD. {began...: Heb. built} 2. And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof {was} threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty {cubits}, and the height thereof thirty cubits. 3. And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits {was} the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; {and} ten cubits {was} the breadth thereof before the house. 4. And for the house he made windows of narrow lights. {of...: or, broad within, and narrow without: or, skewed and closed} 5. And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, {against} the walls of the house round about, {both} of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about: {against the wall: or, upon, or, joining to the wall} {built chambers: Heb. built floors} {made chambers: Heb. made ribs} 6. The nethermost chamber {was} five cubits broad, and the middle {was} six cubits broad, and the third {was} seven cubits broad: for without {in the wall} of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that {the beams} should not be fastened in the walls of the house. {narrowed...: Heb. narrowings, or, rebatements} 7. And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe {nor} any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. 8. The door for the middle chamber {was} in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle {chamber}, and out of the middle into the third. {side: Heb. shoulder} 9. So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar. {with...: or, the vaultbeams and the panellings with cedar} 10. And {then} he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house {with} timber of cedar. 11. And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 12. {Concerning} this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David thy father: 13. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel. 14. So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 15. And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: {and} he covered {them} on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir. {both...: or, from the floor of the house unto the walls, etc} 16. And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built {them} for it within, {even} for the oracle, {even} for the most holy {place}. 17. And the house, that {is}, the temple before it, was forty cubits {long}. 18. And the cedar of the house within {was} carved with knops and open flowers: all {was} cedar; there was no stone seen. {knops: or, gourds} {open: Heb. openings of} 19. And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 20. And the oracle in the forepart {was} twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and {so} covered the altar {which was of} cedar. {pure: Heb. shut up} 21. So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold. 22. And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that {was} by the oracle he overlaid with gold. 23. And within the oracle he made two cherubims {of} olive tree, {each} ten cubits high. {olive: or, oily: Heb. trees of oil} 24. And five cubits {was} the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other {were} ten cubits. 25. And the other cherub {was} ten cubits: both the cherubims {were} of one measure and one size. 26. The height of the one cherub {was} ten cubits, and so {was it} of the other cherub. 27. And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the {one} wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. {they...: or, the cherubims stretched forth their wings} 28. And he overlaid the cherubims with gold. 29. And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without. {open flowers: Heb. openings of flowers} 30. And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without. 31. And for the entering of the oracle he made doors {of} olive tree: the lintel {and} side posts {were} a fifth part {of the wall}. {a fifth...: or, fivesquare} 32. The two doors also {were of} olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid {them} with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees. {two...: or, leaves of the doors} {open flowers: Heb. openings of flowers} 33. So also made he for the door of the temple posts {of} olive tree, a fourth part {of the wall}. {a fourth...: or, foursquare} 34. And the two doors {were of} fir tree: the two leaves of the one door {were} folding, and the two leaves of the other door {were} folding. 35. And he carved {thereon} cherubims and palm trees and open flowers: and covered {them} with gold fitted upon the carved work. 36. And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams. 37. In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif: 38. And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which {is} the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it. {through out...: or, with all the parts thereof, and with all the ordinances thereof} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 71. So, Solomon was like totally flexing and constructing his crib for thirteen years, and he straight up completed the whole dang thing. 2. He also constructed the super cool house in Lebanon, it was like a hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits tall. It had four rows of epic cedar pillars with cedar beams on top of them. 3. And the top was decked out with cedar planks resting upon forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row. (The term 'beams' means 'ribs' in Hebrew.) 4. There were three rows of windows, with lights aligned in three ranks. It looked pretty lit, with each light shining in perfect harmony. 5. And all the doorways and frames were square with windows, and the light was arranged in three rows, matching light with light. (The doorways and frames were square when viewed from the front.) 6. Then he built a super cool entryway with these awesome pillars. It was like 50 cubits long and 30 cubits wide. The entrance was right in front, with more pillars and a really thick beam. It was all so rad. 7. So he built this cool throne porch where he could make righteous judgments. It was like, the ultimate judgment spot with cedar covering the whole floor, from one side to the other. It was super stylish, man! (Hebrew version: like, top to bottom, floor to floor!) 8. And the place where he lived had another area with a cool entrance, which was designed similarly. Solomon also built a space for the daughter of Pharaoh, whom he married, that looked just like this entrance. 9. All of these materials were super expensive, like, made from fancy stones that were cut perfectly with saws. They were used for everything, from the foundation to the highest part, even on the outside facing the big courtyard. 10. And the base was made of super expensive stones, like huge stones that were ten cubits long and eight cubits wide. 11. And there were really expensive stones, cut to perfection, and some really nice cedar wood up there too. 12. The whole court area was made up of three rows of smooth stones and a row of cedar beams. These were used for both the inner court of the house of the LORD and the porch of the house. 13. So King Solomon hit up Hiram from Tyre and was like, 'Yo, come through.' (BTW, Hiram is also known as Huram.) 14. He was this guy, right, whose mom was a widow, and he was from the tribe of Naphtali. And his dad, man, he was a skilled worker from Tyre, all into making stuff with brass, you know? This dude was so wise, understanding, and had mad skills to do all kinds of brass work. Eventually, he met King Solomon and did all the awesome brass work for him. That's how he rolled, being the son of a widow and all. 15. So he made these cool brass pillars, each one standing at a whopping eighteen cubits tall. And there was this slick design of twelve cubits that went all around each of them. (FYI: 'cast' means 'fashioned' in Hebrew) 16. Then he created two awesome brass caps to place on top of the pillars. Each cap was five cubits tall, just like the other one. 17. They made cool net patterns and dope chain designs for the decorative tops of the pillars. They had seven for one top and seven for the other top. 18. And he made these dope pillars, and put two rows all around them, to cover the tops with this sick-looking network, and added some sick pomegranates too, just like he did for the other tops. 19. And the cool decorative tops on the pillars were like lily flowers, so awesome! They were in the entrance, measuring four cubits. 20. Yo, check it out! So, those dope chapiters on the two pillars had some sick pomegranate designs on top, right above the belly part where the network was. And get this, there were like two hundred pomegranates arranged in rows all around the other chapiter. Talk about a stylish touch, straight fire! 21. And he put the pillars by the entrance of the temple. He named the right one Jachin, which means 'He shall establish', and he named the left one Boaz, which means 'In it is strength'. 22. And on the very top of the pillars there were beautiful flower designs, showing that the craftsmanship of the pillars was complete. 23. So he created this big round pool, it was ten cubits from one end to the other, and it stood five cubits tall. A line of thirty cubits went all the way around it. 24. And on the rim all around there were decorative knobs, ten within each cubit, encircling the sea all around. These decorative knobs were formed in two rows when the whole thing was cast. 25. There were twelve oxen holding it up, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was placed on top of them, and their backparts were all on the inside. 26. It was, like, a handbreadth thick and the rim of it was designed to look like a cup rim with beautiful lily flowers. It could hold, like, a whopping two thousand baths! 27. And he built ten sick bases out of brass. Each base was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits tall. 28. The bases were structured like this: they had edges and the edges were placed between the ledges. 29. And on the edges of the ledges, there were these sick AF lions, oxen, and cherubims. And above the ledges was like a dope foundation, and beneath the lions and oxen, there were these rad decorations made of super intricate thin work. 30. Each podium had four cool metal wheels and shiny brass plates. The four corners had sturdy supports, and under the sink were sleek support structures crafted like art. They totally rocked, just like the hip additions on the side. 31. And the opening inside the top part was about a cubit wide: but the opening itself was circular, sculpted to match the design of the pedestal, a cubit and a half wide: and also around the opening there were engravings with their edges, square-shaped, not circular. 32. And there were four wheels beneath the edges, and the axles of the wheels were attached to the base. The height of a wheel was one and a half cubits. The axles were attached to the base. 33. The wheels were totally rad, like straight out of a cool chariot movie. The axles, hubs, rims, and spokes were all crafted with some sick molten skill. 34. And, like, there were four super solid support thingies at the four corners of one foundation, and these support thingies were part of the foundation itself, like, inseparable. 35. On top of the base, there was a cool circular thing about half a cubit high. And the ledges and borders on top of the base were totally matching. 36. So, on the surfaces and edges of the plates, there were carvings of cherubims, lions, and palm trees. Each detail was perfectly proportioned, with additional decorative elements all around. 37. Then he created the ten bases with all the same casting, measuring, and size. 38. So he made ten big washbasins out of brass. Each washbasin held forty baths of water, and each washbasin was four cubits tall. He put one washbasin on top of each of the ten bases. 39. Then he placed five bases on the right side of the crib, and five on the left side of the crib: and he placed the sea on the right side of the crib, facing the south in the east. {side: Heb. shoulder} 40. And Hiram was responsible for making the fancy sinks, fancy scoopers, and fancy bowls. He completed all the work that King Solomon asked him to do for the house of the LORD. 41. The two pillars, and the two lit-looking bowls on top of them; and the two fancy nets, to cover the two bowls on top of the pillars; 42. And there were, like, 400 pomegranates for the two cool designs, ya know? Two rows of pomegranates for each design, to decorate the two bowls that were on top of the pillars. It was on the front side of the pillars, btw! 😎 43. And like, there were ten bases, and ten sick lavers on top of the bases, you feel me? 44. There was also this sick pool, and like, a bunch of big ox statues chilling beneath it, ya know? 45. And there were like, these sick pots, shovels, and basons - all these cool stuff that Hiram made for king Solomon's crib, you know? They were made out of shiny brass, like super polished and stuff. 46. The king yeeted them into the flat area of Jordan, straight into the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan. {in...: Heb. in the thickness of the ground} 47. So Solomon didn't bother weighing all the stuff, 'cause there was so much of it! They couldn't even figure out how heavy the brass was. It was like, way too much to handle! 48. So Solomon made all the sick items for the house of the LORD: a sick gold altar, and a sick gold table for the yummy bread. 49. Yo, there were these lit gold candlesticks, five on each side, flexin' in front of the oracle. They were all decked out with flowers, lamps, and gold tongs, no less. 50. And there were these sick gold bowls, snuffers, basons, spoons, and censers, all shiny and pure. The hinges for the doors of the super holy place inside the house were also made of gold, along with the doors of the whole temple. Like, totally fancy stuff. 51. And that's how everything king Solomon built for the house of the LORD was finished. Solomon also brought in the stuff his dad David had dedicated—like the silver, gold, and fancy things—and put them with the rest of the treasures in the house of the LORD. These were the special things that belonged to David. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 71. But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. 2. He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof {was} an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars. 3. And {it was} covered with cedar above upon the beams, that {lay} on forty five pillars, fifteen {in} a row. {beams: Heb. ribs} 4. And {there were} windows {in} three rows, and light {was} against light {in} three ranks. {light was...: Heb. sight against sight} 5. And all the doors and posts {were} square, with the windows: and light {was} against light {in} three ranks. {doors...: or, spaces and pillars were square in prospect} 6. And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof {was} fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch {was} before them: and the {other} pillars and the thick beam {were} before them. {before them: or, according to them} 7. Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, {even} the porch of judgment: and {it was} covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other. {from...: Heb. from floor to floor} 8. And his house where he dwelt {had} another court within the porch, {which} was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken {to wife}, like unto this porch. 9. All these {were of} costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and {so} on the outside toward the great court. 10. And the foundation {was of} costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. 11. And above {were} costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars. 12. And the great court round about {was} with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house. 13. And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. {Hiram: also called, Huram} 14. He {was} a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father {was} a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work. {a widow's...: Heb. the son of a widow woman} 15. For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about. {cast: Heb. fashioned} 16. And he made two chapiters {of} molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter {was} five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter {was} five cubits: 17. {And} nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which {were} upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. 18. And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the chapiters that {were} upon the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter. 19. And the chapiters that {were} upon the top of the pillars {were} of lily work in the porch, four cubits. 20. And the chapiters upon the two pillars {had pomegranates} also above, over against the belly which {was} by the network: and the pomegranates {were} two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter. 21. And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz. {Jachin: that is, He shall establish} {Boaz: that is, In it is strength} 22. And upon the top of the pillars {was} lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished. 23. And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: {it was} round all about, and his height {was} five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. {from...: Heb. from his brim to his brim} 24. And under the brim of it round about {there were} knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops {were} cast in two rows, when it was cast. 25. It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea {was set} above upon them, and all their hinder parts {were} inward. 26. And it {was} an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths. 27. And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits {was} the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it. 28. And the work of the bases {was} on this {manner}: they had borders, and the borders {were} between the ledges: 29. And on the borders that {were} between the ledges {were} lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges {there was} a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen {were} certain additions made of thin work. 30. And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver {were} undersetters molten, at the side of every addition. 31. And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above {was} a cubit: but the mouth thereof {was} round {after} the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it {were} gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round. 32. And under the borders {were} four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels {were joined} to the base: and the height of a wheel {was} a cubit and half a cubit. {joined...: Heb. in the base} 33. And the work of the wheels {was} like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, {were} all molten. 34. And {there were} four undersetters to the four corners of one base: {and} the undersetters {were} of the very base itself. 35. And in the top of the base {was there} a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof {were} of the same. 36. For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about. {proportion: Heb. nakedness} 37. After this {manner} he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, {and} one size. 38. Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: {and} every laver was four cubits: {and} upon every one of the ten bases one laver. 39. And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south. {side: Heb. shoulder} 40. And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD: {And Hiram: Heb. And Hirom} 41. The two pillars, and the {two} bowls of the chapiters that {were} on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which {were} upon the top of the pillars; 42. And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, {even} two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that {were} upon the pillars; {upon...: Heb. upon the face of the pillars} 43. And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 44. And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea; 45. And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, {were of} bright brass. {bright: Heb. made bright or, scoured} 46. In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan. {in...: Heb. in the thickness of the ground} 47. And Solomon left all the vessels {unweighed}, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out. {because...: Heb. for the exceeding multitude} {found: Heb. searched} 48. And Solomon made all the vessels that {pertained} unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread {was}, 49. And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right {side}, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs {of} gold, 50. And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers {of} pure gold; and the hinges {of} gold, {both} for the doors of the inner house, the most holy {place, and} for the doors of the house, {to wit}, of the temple. {censers: Heb. ash pans} 51. So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; {even} the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD. {things...: Heb. holy things of David} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 81. So Solomon gathered all the old heads of Israel, and the top guys from all the tribes, the big bosses of the Israelite families, to meet with King Solomon in Jerusalem. They wanted to bring the sacred ark that represents the LORD's promise out of David's city, also known as Zion. 2. And like, all the dudes in Israel totally gathered around king Solomon during this lit feast in the month Ethanim, which, by the way, is the seventh month. 3. So like, all the OGs of Israel rolled up, and the priests grabbed the ark, no cap. 4. So they brought the ark of the LORD, the tabernacle, and all the sacred stuff that was in the tabernacle up, with the priests and the Levites leading the way. 5. So like, King Solomon and all the squad from Israel gathered around him, you know, all swaggy in front of the ark and started flexing hard by sacrificing tons of sheep and oxen. There were so many, man, we lost count 'cause it was straight up lit! 6. Yo, the priests brought in the ark of the LORD's covenant to its spot, into the super sacred place in the house, right under the wings of the cherubims. 7. So, like, the cherubims totally stretched out their two wings over the spot where the ark was, and they totally shielded the ark and its poles from above, you know. 8. And they pulled out the poles, so that the ends of the poles were visible from within the sacred place in front of the special box, but not visible from outside. And there they remain even to this day. (ends: Hebrew: heads) (sacred place: or, ark) 9. The only thing in the ark were these two stone tablets that Moses put in there at Horeb, when the LORD made a deal with the Israelites after they dipped out of Egypt. 10. So, like, after the priests left the sacred zone, a massive cloud totally filled up the LORD's crib. 11. The priests couldn't even do their thing because of the thick cloud, cause the house of the LORD was filled with His glorious presence. 12. So Solomon said, God said that he would live in total darkness. 13. I've totally hooked you up with a sick crib to crash at forever. It's the ultimate chill spot you won't wanna leave. 14. Then the king turned around and gave his blessings to all the peeps of Israel. (And all the peeps of Israel stood up;) 15. And he was like, OMG, totally blessed is the LORD God of Israel, who like talked to David, my father, and like actually made it happen with his hands, and was like, 'I got this, yo!' 16. Ever since I freed my peeps, Israel, from Egypt, I didn't pick any random city from the tribes to build a crib for myself. Instead, I chose David to lead my fam, Israel. 17. So, like, David, my dad, really wanted to construct a rad house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 18. And God was like, 'Yo David, my homie, I heard you wanted to build me a sick crib in your heart. That's pretty solid, man. Respect.' 19. But you won't be the one building the house, it'll be your future kid who's gonna do it in my name. 20. So, like, God totally kept His word and everything, just as He said. And now, I'm taking over for my dad David and sitting on the throne of Israel, just like God promised. Plus, I've built this awesome house to honor the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 21. And I made a sick spot for the ark, like where the LORD's promise vibes at. He made it back in the day when he saved our ancestors from Egypt, you know? 22. So, Solomon was like, standing up in front of everyone, right by the altar of the LORD. And get this, it was in front of the whole Israel crew. He like, stretched out his hands toward heaven, you know? 23. And he was like, yo, LORD God of Israel, you're, like, the most epic God ever, in the whole heaven above and the earth beneath. You totally keep your promises and show mad love and kindness to your peeps who straight up walk before you with all their heart, no cap! 🙌 24. You've totally kept your promise to my dad, David. You spoke it and now you're makin' it happen, just like it is right now. 25. Yo, LORD God of Israel, please hold up your promise to my dad David. You said there'd always be someone from his bloodline chillin' on the throne of Israel. So, it's like super important for your crew to stay on point and walk in your ways, just like my dad did. 26. Yo, God of Israel, please make sure your word to my dad David comes true, like you said it would. 27. Like, seriously, can God actually chill on earth? I mean, the whole universe, even the super fancy parts, can't even handle Him, so this house I built is like, way too small for Him, ya know? 28. But please listen to the prayer of your servant, O LORD my God. Pay attention to the requests and pleas that your servant is making today. 29. So that you're always aware of this house, day and night, and especially of the special spot where you said, 'I'll put my name there.' That way, you'll be able to listen to the prayers that your servant makes in this place. 30. Yo, listen up and pay attention to your servant's request and the prayers of your people Israel, when they pray towards this spot. Hear them out from your heavenly crib and when you actually listen, forgive them, you know. {or, like, in this place} 31. If someone does something wrong to their friend and is told to swear an oath, and they come to your altar in this house to take the oath: 32. So, like, listen up, God, and take action. You gotta judge your peeps, like, punish the bad ones and make them pay for their wrongdoings. But on the flip side, you gotta back up the good ones and reward them for being righteous, ya know, give 'em what they deserve. 33. When your peeps, the Israelites, are totally wrecked by their enemies 'cause they messed up and went against you, but then they come back to you, confess your name, pray, and beg for your mercy in this place: 34. So like, listen up in heaven and forgive the mistakes of your people Israel, and like, bring them back to the land that you gave to their ancestors. 35. When the sky is like, totally closed and there's no rain 'cause they messed up against you; if they send prayers in this direction and say sorry, and totally change their ways, when you're making them go through a tough time: 36. Yo, listen up in heaven, and like, forgive the wrongs of your peeps, both your servants and the Israel fam. Show 'em the lit path to follow and bless their land with rain, 'cause you gave it to them as an inheritance, ya know? 37. If, like, there's a serious lack of food in the area, or if there's like, a major outbreak of some nasty disease, or if crops are getting messed up by things like intense weather or annoying bugs, or if the people are getting attacked by their enemies in their own cities, or pretty much any kind of bad situation or sickness that happens, ya know? 38. Whenever someone, like, prays or asks for something, whether it's just one person or, like, all the cool people in Israel, and they're, like, totally aware of the struggles deep inside their hearts, and they, like, raise their hands towards this place, you know: 39. Okay, listen up, God, as you kick it in your heavenly crib. Like, forgive us and stuff, and do your thing, and hook everyone up based on how they roll, since you totally know what's up with their hearts (and seriously, you're the only one who knows what's going on in our hearts, all us humans). 40. So they'll respect You as long as they live in the land You gave to our ancestors. 41. Oh, and when it comes to someone who's not from your crew, ya know, not one of your homies from Israel but someone from a far-off land who's all about repping your name... 42. Cuz people gonna hear about how awesome you are, how you flex with your strength, and how you throw out your power, when they come and pray towards this place. 43. Yo, listen up from your heavenly crib and grant every request that comes your way, even from the outsider. The goal is for everyone on this planet to recognize your name and respect you, just like the people of Israel do. And they gotta know that this epic house I built is named after you. Like, your name is literally on it! 44. When your squad goes into a battle against their rival, wherever you send them, they should hit up the LORD, facing the city you picked, and showing love towards the house I built for your name. (the way of the city: in other words, straight to the heart of it!) 45. So, like, listen up, man. When they pray and ask for stuff, you gotta be there, y'know? Take their side and support them. #NoDoubt 46. If they mess up and do wrong (because let's face it, everyone messes up sometimes), and you get mad at them and let the enemy take them captive to their territory, whether it's far away or nearby, 47. But, like, if they like stop and really think about it in the place where they got taken as captives, and they genuinely feel sorry and ask for forgiveness in the same place where they were taken captives, saying, 'Yo, we messed up big time and did some seriously messed up stuff; we were totally wicked.' 48. And they'll come back to you with their whole heart and soul, even if they're stuck in their enemies' land who took them as captives. They'll pray towards the land you gave to their ancestors, the city you picked, and the house I made for your name. 49. So like, listen up, hear their prayer and supplication in heaven, where you dwell, and make sure they get what they deserve. #justice 50. And forgive your people for messing up and doing wrong against you, and for all the times they messed up and went against you. Show them kindness, especially to those who have them under control, so that they might also show them kindness in return. 51. Because they're, like, totally yours, the people you rescued from the land of Egypt, where life was as tough as being stuck in a scorching iron furnace. 52. So that you'll totally listen to your servant's prayers and the prayers of your people Israel, and give them what they ask for. 53. You picked them out from everyone else on earth, to be Yours and only Yours, just like You told Moses. Remember when You rescued our ancestors from Egypt, God? 54. So, like, after Solomon finished praying this whole deep prayer to the LORD, he got up from the altar of the LORD where he was kneeling with his hands raised up to the sky. 55. So he stood up and gave a big shoutout to all the squad of Israel, like yo, saying, 56. Praise the LORD, who's totally hooked us up with some chill vibes and brought peace to his crew, the peeps of Israel. He stayed true to every single promise, not even one of his awesome words fell through the cracks. He dropped all those promises to Moses, his main servant, and didn't let us down. 🙌 57. May God be with us, just like he was with our ancestors. May he never abandon or desert us. 58. So our hearts can vibe with Him, and we stay loyal to His ways, following His rules, decrees, and judgments just like our ancestors were told to do. 59. And may these words of mine, which I've prayed before the LORD, always be close to our God day and night. May He support His servant and the people of Israel in every situation that arises. (Heb. as needed for each day) 60. So, like, everyone should know that the LORD is totally God and no one else can even come close. 61. So, like, make sure your heart is totally aligned with the LORD our God, you know? Walk the talk and keep His commandments, just like we're doing it right now. 62. And the king, along with all of Israel, flexed their worship game in front of the LORD. 63. So Solomon flexed big time with a sacrifice to the LORD, yo. He dropped 22k oxen and 120k sheep on the table. And you know what, the king and all the peeps of Israel were like, 'This is lit!' They dedicated the LORD's crib. 64. On that day, the king made the middle of the court in front of the house of the LORD sacred. He offered burnt offerings, meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings there because the bronze altar in front of the LORD wasn't big enough to handle all the offerings. 65. So like, back then, Solomon threw this massive feast party, right? And I'm talking huge! Everyone in Israel came, from Hamath to the river of Egypt, to celebrate and honor the Lord our God. And get this, the party went on for a solid fourteen days - a whole two weeks of absolute celebration! 66. On the eighth day, he let the people go home. They shouted praises to the king and went back to their cribs, feeling super stoked and happy because of all the awesome things that the LORD had done for David, his right-hand man, and for the people of Israel. They were totally grateful, dude! \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 81. Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which {is} Zion. {chief: Heb. princes} 2. And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which {is} the seventh month. 3. And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 4. And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that {were} in the tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring up. 5. And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that were assembled unto him, {were} with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 6. And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy {place, even} under the wings of the cherubims. 7. For the cherubims spread forth {their} two wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. 8. And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy {place} before the oracle, and they were not seen without: and there they are unto this day. {ends: Heb. heads} {holy...: or, ark} 9. {There was} nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made {a covenant} with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. {when the: or, where the} 10. And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy {place}, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, 11. So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD. 12. Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. 13. I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever. 14. And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;) 15. And he said, Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel, which spake with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled {it}, saying, 16. Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. 17. And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 18. And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart. 19. Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name. 20. And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 21. And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein {is} the covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. 22. And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven: 23. And he said, LORD God of Israel, {there is} no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart: 24. Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled {it} with thine hand, as {it is} this day. 25. Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me. {fail...: Heb. be cut off unto thee a man from my sight} {so that: Heb. only if} 26. And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. 27. But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded? 28. Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day: 29. That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, {even} toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place. {toward this place: or, in this place} 30. And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive. {toward this place: or, in this place} 31. If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house: {and an oath...: Heb. and he require an oath of him} 32. Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness. 33. When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house: {in: or, toward} 34. Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers. 35. When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 36. Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance. 37. If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting, mildew, locust, {or} if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness {there be}; {cities: or, jurisdiction} 38. What prayer and supplication soever be {made} by any man, {or} by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: 39. Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, {even} thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;) 40. That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers. 41. Moreover concerning a stranger, that {is} not of thy people Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake; 42. (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house; 43. Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as {do} thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name. {this...: Heb. thy name is called upon this house} 44. If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and {toward} the house that I have built for thy name: {toward the city: Heb. the way of the city} 45. Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. {cause: or, right} 46. If they sin against thee, (for {there is} no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near; 47. {Yet} if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; {bethink...: Heb. bring back to their heart} 48. And {so} return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: 49. Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause, {cause: or, right} 50. And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them: 51. For they {be} thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: 52. That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee. 53. For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, {to be} thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD. 54. And it was {so}, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven. 55. And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying, 56. Blessed {be} the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. {failed: Heb. fallen} 57. The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: 58. That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers. 59. And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require: {at all...: Heb. the thing of a day in his day} 60. That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD {is} God, {and that there is} none else. 61. Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day. 62. And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the LORD. 63. And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD. 64. The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that {was} before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that {was} before the LORD {was} too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings. 65. And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, {even} fourteen days. 66. On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people. {blessed: or, thanked} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 91. After Solomon was done flexing with the mad sick crib he built for the Lord's house, and his own pad for the king, just as he wished and vibed with. 2. So, like, Solomon was chilling when the LORD showed up again, just like the first time at Gibeon. 3. And God was like, yo dude, I totally heard your prayer and the stuff you asked for. This place you built is sacred, I've claimed it as my own and I'm gonna keep it that way forever. And just so you know, I'll always be watching and caring about what happens there, no cap. 4. And if you wanna be like David, your dad, and live with integrity and do what I tell you to do, and follow my rules and guidelines: 5. So basically, I'm gonna make sure that your kingdom in Israel is gonna last forever, just like I promised your dad David. Trust me, there's always gonna be someone ruling over Israel, no doubt about it. 6. If y'all totally start straying away from following me, like you or your homies, and refuse to keep my rules and regulations that I've dropped on you, but instead start simpin' over other deities and flexin' on 'em: 7. Yo, I'm gonna straight up remove Israel from the land I blessed them with. The crib I made sacred for my name? Yeah, I'm gonna kick it outta my view. And Israel? They're gonna become like a famous saying, a word people use to mock. 8. And when they see this lit house, everyone who walks by will be shook and be like, 'Whoa!' They'll be talking, like, 'Why did God do all this crazy stuff to this place and the crib?' 9. And they will be like, 'Dude, it's because they totally ditched the LORD their God, who rescued their ancestors from Egypt, and started clinging onto other gods, worshiping and serving them. So, that's why the LORD brought all this evil upon them, you know? No hate, just facts.' 10. So, after like, 20 whole years, when Solomon finished building the two rad houses - the house of the LORD and the king's crib - 11. So, like, King Hiram of Tyre totally hooked Solomon up with some sick cedar trees, fir trees, and gold, just how Solomon wanted it. And in return, Solomon gave Hiram twenty lit cities in Galilee land. Talk about a rad trade! 12. So Hiram rolled up to check out the cities that Solomon hooked him up with, but they were just not his vibe. Like, they totally didn't meet his standards, you know? 13. And he's like, dude, what's up with these cities you gave me, bro? So, he named them Cabul, which basically means they're gross and disappointing, and that name stuck till today. 14. And Hiram DM'd the king with, like, 120 talents of gold. 15. So basically, King Solomon needed some funds to build the house of the LORD, his own crib, and some other cool stuff like Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 16. So, like, Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, went and attacked Gezer, totally burnt it down and killed all the Canaanite peeps living there. And get this, he then decided to gift the city to his daughter, who's actually Solomon's wife. 17. So like, Solomon totally built Gezer and Bethhoron below, 18. Whoa, check out Baalath and Tadmor, they're like in the middle of nowhere, out in the wild lands! 19. Solomon had a ton of cities, like seriously stacked with places for his fancy chariots and sick horsemen. He was all about building cool stuff in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and every inch of his territory. Man, he really wanted to make it happen, ya know? 20. And all the peeps that were still around from the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who weren't part of the children of Israel, 21. So, like, there were some kids left in the land that the Israelite children couldn't totally wipe out, right? Well, Solomon decided to make them pay up and work as servants to this very day. It's like a tribute or something, you know? 22. But Solomon didn't enslave any of the Israelites. They were all warriors, his loyal crew, their leaders, and the ones in charge of his cool chariots and horse squad. 23. So basically, these were the main boss dudes who were in charge of all the work that Solomon was doing. There were like 550 of them, and they were the ones calling the shots and overseeing all the people doing the actual work. 24. So, Pharaoh's daughter moved into the house that Solomon built for her in the city of David, and then he went ahead and built Millo. 25. So, like, three times a year, Solomon would offer burnt offerings and peace offerings on this sick altar he built for the LORD, and he'd burn some lit incense on the altar that was right in front of the LORD. And boom! He finished the whole house. 26. King Solomon flexed and built a whole fleet of ships in Eziongeber, right next to Eloth, on the Red Sea coast in the Edom region. It was lit, fam! 🔥 27. So Hiram sent his squad of experienced sailors on his dope navy, along with Solomon's crew. 28. So they went to Ophir and got four hundred and twenty talents of gold and brought it back to King Solomon. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 91. And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desire which he was pleased to do, 2. That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon. 3. And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. 4. And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, {and} wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: 5. Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel. 6. {But} if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments {and} my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them: 7. Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people: 8. And at this house, {which} is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house? 9. And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil. 10. And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house, 11. ({Now} Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 12. And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not. {pleased...: Heb. were not right in his eyes} 13. And he said, What cities {are} these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day. {Cabul: that is, displeasing, or, dirty} 14. And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. 15. And this {is} the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. 16. {For} Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it {for} a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife. 17. And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, 18. And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 19. And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. {that which...: Heb. the desire of Solomon which he desired} 20. {And} all the people {that were} left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which {were} not of the children of Israel, 21. Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day. 22. But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they {were} men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen. 23. These {were} the chief of the officers that {were} over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work. 24. But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which {Solomon} had built for her: then did he build Millo. 25. And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that {was} before the LORD. So he finished the house. {upon the altar that: Heb. upon it, etc} 26. And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which {is} beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom. {shore: Heb. lip} 27. And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 28. And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought {it} to king Solomon. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 101. So, like, word got out about how amazing Solomon was and how he was all about praising the LORD. The queen of Sheba was like, 'I need to see if this guy's legit,' so she came and hit him up with some seriously tough questions. 2. And she pulled up to Jerusalem with a massive crew, rolling in on some camels carrying all the fancy spices, loads of gold, and precious bling. Once she reached Solomon, she sat down and had a deep conversation about everything on her mind. 3. Solomon answered all of her questions without holding back anything. He didn't keep any secrets from her, spillin' all the tea like a boss. 4. And like, when the queen of Sheba checked out all of Solomon's mad wisdom, and the sick crib he built, 5. And all the food on his table, the way his servants were sitting, the way his ministers were serving, their clothes, his personal drink servers, and the path he took to go up to the house of the LORD - it left her speechless and amazed. {attendance: in other words, standing} {cupbearers: or, butlers} 6. Yo, King, gotta tell you, word on the street was true about your mad skills and wisdom back in my own land. No cap. {report: Hebrew translation is 'word'} {acts: or, sayings} 7. But I didn't believe it, until I actually saw it with my own eyes. And let me tell you, it was even better than what I had heard. Your wisdom and success totally surpass the hype! 8. Blessed are your squad, so blessed are these your loyal peeps who stay by your side, always vibing with your wisdom. 9. Praise the LORD your God, who totally vibes with you and chose you to be the ruler of Israel because he's always loved Israel and wanted you to bring fairness and justice. 10. And she hooked up the king with like, a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and like, a ton of spices and precious stones. Yo, there ain't never been no stash of spices like the ones the queen of Sheba blessed king Solomon with. 11. And Hiram's navy, who brought gold from Ophir, also brought in a ton of almug trees and precious stones from Ophir. (By the way, almug trees are also known as algum trees.) 12. The king used super cool almug trees to make pillars for the house of the LORD and the king's crib. He also had some sick harps and psalteries for the singers. People hadn't even seen those almug trees before, they were that rare. 13. King Solomon hooked up the queen of Sheba with everything she wanted, no cap. He gave her whatever she asked for, on top of what he already gave her from his royal stash. Then she bounced and went back to her own country with her crew. (FYI: Solomon really hooked her up, no lie) 14. So, like, Solomon received this insane amount of gold in just one year, man. It was, like, six hundred and sixty talents of gold! Can you even imagine that? So epic, dude! 15. In addition to the stuff he got from all the cool merchant peeps, the spice traders, and even the bosses from Arabia and the local rulers/captains. Ya know, lots of goodies! 16. King Solomon flexed with two hundred gold targets, each worth six hundred shekels of gold. 17. So this dude totally crafted like 300 sick golden shields. Each shield took a hefty three pounds of gold to make, man! Then the king just stashed 'em in this badass crib called the House of the Forest of Lebanon, no biggie. 18. And the king flexed with this sick throne made of ivory, all blinged out with the finest gold. 19. The throne had, like, six steps, and the top of the throne was rounded at the back. And there were these cool supports on both sides of the seat, with two lions standing beside them. (By the way, 'behind' in Hebrew means on the back part, and 'stays' means hands.) 20. And there were, like, twelve fierce lions chillin' on both sides of the six steps, man. No other kingdom had anything as rad as that. {so: like, it's crazy} 21. So like, all of King Solomon's drinking cups were made of gold, and all the fancy cups in the Lebanese forest palace were pure gold too! They didn't even bother with silver back then, it didn't matter to them at all. 22. The king had a sick navy with the king of Hiram at sea: every three years the sick navy would roll in, bringing loads of gold, silver, fancy ivory, cool apes, and stunning peacocks. {ivory: or, elephants' teeth} 23. King Solomon was, like, the ultimate flex when it came to being rich and wise, no other kings could even come close. 24. So basically, people from all over the place were flocking to Solomon because they heard he was super wise, thanks to God dropping that wisdom in his heart. 25. So everyone came bringing their gifts: awesome silver and gold stuff, cool clothes, sick armor and weapons, fancy spices, swift horses, and fresh rides, like every single year! 26. So, Solomon flexed by having a whole army of chariots and horsemen. Picture this: he had, like, a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. He spread them out in different cities, you know, to have chariot fun, and he kept some by his side in Jerusalem, right alongside him. 27. And the king hooked up Jerusalem with silver, like it was made out of cool rocks, and he hooked up the cedars, making them as awesome as the sycomore trees in the valley because there were mad amounts of them. (made: means he gave) 28. So like, Solomon brought in some dope horses from Egypt, along with some fresh linen threads. The king's merchants bought the linen threads at a decent price, ya know? 29. Then someone brought a sick ride out of Egypt, worth 600 silver coins, and a dope horse for 150. They made mad profit by supplying fancy rides to the kings of the Hittites and Syria. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 101. And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions. 2. And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. 3. And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not {any} thing hid from the king, which he told her not. {questions: Heb. words} 4. And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and the house that he had built, 5. And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her. {attendance: Heb. standing} {cupbearers: or, butlers} 6. And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. {report: Heb. word} {acts: or, sayings} 7. Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen {it}: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard. {thy...: Heb. thou hast added wisdom and goodness to} 8. Happy {are} thy men, happy {are} these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, {and} that hear thy wisdom. 9. Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice. 10. And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. 11. And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones. {almug...: also called, algum trees} 12. And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day. {pillars: or, rails: Heb. a prop} 13. And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside {that} which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants. {of his...: Heb. according to the hand of king Solomon} 14. Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, 15. Beside {that he had} of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country. {governors: or, captains} 16. And king Solomon made two hundred targets {of} beaten gold: six hundred {shekels} of gold went to one target. 17. And {he made} three hundred shields {of} beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 18. Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. 19. The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne {was} round behind: and {there were} stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays. {behind: Heb. on the hinder part thereof} {stays: Heb. hands} 20. And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. {the like: Heb. so} 21. And all king Solomon's drinking vessels {were of} gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon {were of} pure gold; none {were of} silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. {none...: or, there was no silver in them} 22. For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. {ivory: or, elephants' teeth} 23. So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. 24. And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. {sought to: Heb. sought the face of} 25. And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 26. And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem. 27. And the king made silver {to be} in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he {to be} as the sycomore trees that {are} in the vale, for abundance. {made: Heb. gave} 28. And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. {And Solomon...: Heb. And the going forth of the horses which was Solomon's} 29. And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred {shekels} of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring {them} out by their means. {by their...: Heb. by their hand} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 111. Yo, King Solomon was all about dating a ton of different women, like the pharaoh's daughter, hotties from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and the Hittites. Dude was expanding his options, ya feel me? 2. God told the Israelites not to mingle with other nations, as they will lead you astray with their different beliefs. But Solomon fell in love with them and embraced their gods. 3. So, like, the dude had 700 wives who were all fancy princesses, and 300 side chicks. And, well, let's just say all those ladies kinda messed with his heart. 4. So like, when Solomon got all old, his wives started tempting him to follow other gods and stuff. And yeah, his heart wasn't totally in sync with the LORD his God, unlike David his dad who had a way more loyal heart. 5. So, like, Solomon was totally into worshipping Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and Milcom, who was like a major abomination to the Ammonites. BTW, Milcom is also known as Molech. 6. So, like, Solomon, he didn't exactly do the right things in the eyes of the LORD, you know? He didn't fully follow the LORD like his dad David did. Like, he didn't totally do what he was supposed to. 7. So, Solomon went ahead and built a really cool spot for worshipping Chemosh, which the Moabites thought was super awesome, on this hill right in front of Jerusalem. And he also built another spot for worshipping Molech, which the Ammonites were really into. But let's make it clear, these deities were considered abominations to God. 8. And he did the same thing for all his non-traditional wives, who worshipped and made offerings to their gods. 9. God was so mad at Solomon because he started ghosting the Lord God of Israel, even though they had major face time twice! 10. And like, God was all like, yo dude, don't be chasing after other gods, but like, he totally did not listen to God and did his own thing, you know what I'm saying? 11. So, the LORD was like, 'Yo, Solomon, since you went and messed up by not keeping my covenant and obeying my rules that I specifically told you, I'm gonna have to take the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your servants. Just sayin'.' 12. But don't worry, during your lifetime I won't do it because of your dad David. I'll take it away from your son instead. 13. But, like, I'm not gonna totally split up the whole kingdom or whatever. I'm gonna let your son have just one tribe, you know, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I've chosen. 14. And God caused a rival to rise against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was a descendant of the king in Edom. 15. So, like, David was chilling in Edom, right? And Joab, the boss of the army, went up to bury the dead dudes after he totally defeated every guy in Edom. No cap! 16. (So Joab and all of Israel stayed in Edom for six months, until they had eliminated every male from the land: ) 17. So Hadad and some of his father's Edomite servants escaped and went to Egypt. At that time, Hadad was just a young kid. 18. So they bounced out of Midian and pulled up to Paran, bringing some homies from Paran with them. They rolled up to Egypt, straight to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And guess what? Pharaoh hooked them up with a crib, food on deck, and even some land. 19. Hadad was, like, totally liked by Pharaoh and got to marry the sister of his own wife, who was Tahpenes, the queen's sister. 20. And Tahpenes' sister gave birth to Genubath, her son, who was raised in Pharaoh's house. Genubath grew up among Pharaoh's sons in the royal household. 21. So, like, when Hadad found out in Egypt that David had passed away and Joab, the commander of the army, was no more, Hadad went to Pharaoh and was like, 'Yo, dude, let me bounce and go back to my own country.' And Hadad was straight-up asking Pharaoh to let him go, you know what I'm saying. 22. So Pharaoh's like, why you wanna bounce back to your homeland? Did I not treat you well enough or something? And the dude's like, nah dude, nothing's lacking, but I still gotta dip, you know? Let me go, fam, no biggie. {Nothing: Heb. Not} 23. And God caused another enemy to rise up against him, Rezon, son of Eliadah, who had fled from his master Hadadezer, the king of Zobah: 24. So, basically, David got a bunch of guys together and became the leader of a crew. They went and defeated some people from Zobah, then settled down in Damascus and took charge over there. 25. And this guy was, like, constantly causing problems for Israel while Solomon was in charge. Not to mention all the trouble that Hadad guy caused. He totally hated Israel and ruled over Syria. 26. So there was this guy named Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who was from Zereda. He used to be Solomon's servant and his mom, Zeruah, was a widow. But here's the crazy part - Jeroboam actually rebelled against the king, and even raised his hand against him. 27. And this is why he went against the king: Solomon built up Millo and fixed the broken parts of the city that belonged to his dad, David. 28. Jeroboam was like, super strong and skilled, and Solomon, peeping that this dude was hardworking, put him in charge of everything related to the house of Joseph. Like, all the responsibilities and stuff. 29. So, like, one day Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, right? And then this prophet dude named Ahijah the Shilonite, he comes across Jeroboam on the way. And get this, Jeroboam was rocking some fresh new clothes. And, yo, they were all alone in the field, just the two of them. 30. And Ahijah grabbed the sick outfit that was on him and tore it into twelve pieces: 31. And he was like, yo Jeroboam, snag yourself ten chunks, ‘cause the LORD, the God of Israel, was like, check it out, I’m about to snatch the kingdom away from Solomon and hook you up with ten tribes, fam: 32. But yo, there gonna be one tribe holdin' it down for my homie David and for Jerusalem, the city I picked outta all the tribes of Israel. 33. So like, they totally ditched me and started idolizing Ashtoreth, the queen of the Zidonians, Chemosh, the god of the Moabites, and Milcom, the god of the Ammonites. They're not even following my ways or doing what's right in my eyes, unlike David, their OG king who stayed on track with my rules and decisions. 34. But I'm not gonna totally strip him of his kingdom, instead, I'll let him be in charge as prince for the rest of his life. All because of David, my loyal servant, who I picked 'cause he always followed my rules and regulations. 35. But I'm gonna snatch that kingdom away from his kid and hand it over to you, like, ten tribes in total. 36. And I'll give one tribe to his son, so that David, my servant, can always have a cool vibe in Jerusalem, the city where I decided to make my presence known. {cool vibe: Hebrew - lit. lamp, or, candle} 37. And like, I've got you, fam. You're gonna have the ultimate power and be the boss, ruling Israel and making all your dreams come true. 38. Yo, if you're down to listen to everything I tell you, and you actually live your life in a way that pleases me, following my rules and doing what's right, just like David did, then I got your back. I'll make sure you have a stable and secure life, just like I did for David, and I'll even give you control over Israel. 39. And I'm gonna totally cause some trouble for the descendants of David, but it won't last forever, I promise. 40. So, like, Solomon was totally out to get Jeroboam. And Jeroboam was like, 'No way, dude!' and peaced out to Egypt to chill with King Shishak. He stayed there until Solomon passed away. 41. Yo, there's so much more that Solomon did, his crazy amazing moves and his insane wisdom, isn't it all written down in the book of Solomon's epic journey? Like, seriously, it's all there - every single cool thing he said and did. 42. So Solomon was the ruler of all Israel in Jerusalem for a solid forty years. Like, this dude was in charge and running the show for a pretty long time. You know, just putting it out there, 'cause it's worth mentioning. Oh, and by the way, when they say timee', they mean 'days'. No biggie, just a little language tidbit for you. Peace out! 43. So, Solomon passed away and was laid to rest in the same city as his father, David. Then, his son Rehoboam took over as the ruler in his place. {Rehoboam: BTW, in Greek, his name is Roboam} \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 111. But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, {and} Hittites; {together...: or, beside} 2. Of the nations {concerning} which the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: {for} surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love. 3. And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 4. For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, {that} his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as {was} the heart of David his father. 5. For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. {Milcom: also called, Molech} 6. And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as {did} David his father. {went...: Heb. fulfilled not after} 7. Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that {is} before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. 8. And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods. 9. And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, 10. And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded. 11. Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. {is done...: Heb. is with thee} 12. Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake: {but} I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. 13. Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; {but} will give one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen. 14. And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he {was} of the king's seed in Edom. 15. For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom; 16. (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:) 17. That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad {being} yet a little child. 18. And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. 19. And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 20. And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh. 21. And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country. {Let...: Heb. Send me away} 22. Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise. {Nothing: Heb. Not} 23. And God stirred him up {another} adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 24. And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David slew them {of Zobah}: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus. 25. And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the mischief that Hadad {did}: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria. 26. And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon's servant, whose mother's name {was} Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up {his} hand against the king. 27. And this {was} the cause that he lifted up {his} hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, {and} repaired the breaches of the city of David his father. {repaired: Heb. closed} 28. And the man Jeroboam {was} a mighty man of valour: and Solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph. {was industrious: Heb. did work} {charge: Heb. burden} 29. And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two {were} alone in the field: 30. And Ahijah caught the new garment that {was} on him, and rent it {in} twelve pieces: 31. And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee: 32. (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:) 33. Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do {that which is} right in mine eyes, and {to keep} my statutes and my judgments, as {did} David his father. 34. Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: 35. But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, {even} ten tribes. 36. And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there. {light: Heb. lamp, or, candle} 37. And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. 38. And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do {that is} right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee. 39. And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever. 40. Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. 41. And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, {are} they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? {acts: or, words, or, things} 42. And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel {was} forty years. {time: Heb. days} 43. And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead. {Rehoboam: Gr. Roboam} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 121. So Rehoboam went to Shechem, because all of Israel had gathered there to make him king. 2. So, like, Jeroboam, Nebat's son, who was still in Egypt at the time, heard about it, ya know? 'Cause he had run away from king Solomon and was living in Egypt and stuff. 3. So they hit up Jeroboam and the whole Israel squad was like, 'Yo, Rehoboam, we gotta talk,' 4. Your dad made our workload unbearable. So, like, could you, like, make his super heavy workload easier for us? If you do that, we'll totally be loyal to you. 5. And he's like, yo, peace out for three days, then come back and see me. And the squad dipped. 6. So, like, King Rehoboam chilled with the OGs who used to be with his dad, King Solomon, back in the day. And he was like, 'Yo, guys, I need your opinion on how to respond to these peeps. What's the move?' 7. And they were like, 'Yo, if you're down to be all about serving these people today and catering to them, speaking kind and positive vibes to them, then they'll be ride or die for you forever.' 8. But he ignored the advice from the wise elders and turned to his squad of homies, who were his day ones and always by his side: 9. And he's like, yo dudes, what's your advice on how to respond to these peeps? They're all like, 'Dude, make the burden your dad laid on us less heavy, bro.' 10. So, like, the dudes who were homies with him, they spoke to him and were like, 'Yo bro, here's how you should talk to the people who were complaining about your dad, saying he made their lives suck. Just tell them that your pinky finger is stronger than your dad's whole body.' 11. So, like, my dad totally burdened you with this super heavy weight, right? Well, guess what? I'm gonna make it even worse for you. He used whips to punish you before, but I'm gonna use freaking scorpions! 12. So Jeroboam and all the peeps came to Rehoboam on the third day, like the king had planned, straight up saying, 'Slide through again on the third day, fam.' 13. And the king totally dissed the people, not taking the advice of the old folks who had his back; {roughly: like, seriously} 14. So I talked to them, taking advice from the homies, and I was like, yo, my dad totally made your life super hard, but guess what? I'm about to make it even harder. Like, my dad used to punish you with whips, but I'm gonna bring out the scorpions for real. 15. So, like, the king didn't listen to the people because, ya know, that was all part of God's plan. God wanted to make sure His words came true, the ones He told Ahijah the Shilonite to speak to Jeroboam, Nebat's son and everything. 16. So, like, when all of Israel saw that the king wasn't listening to them, the people were like, 'What's our deal with David? We don't get anything from being Jesse's son. It's time for you, David, to take care of your own house.' And then Israel peaced out and went back to their tents. 17. So, like, the Israelites who were living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam was their king and all. 18. So King Rehoboam sent Adoram, the guy in charge of taxes, and all of Israel literally pelted him with stones until he died. So, King Rehoboam quickly hopped into his fancy chariot and got the heck out of there, heading straight to Jerusalem. 19. So Israel totally ghosted the house of David up until now. {ghosted: or, ditched} 20. So, like, everyone in Israel found out that Jeroboam came back and they were all like, 'Yo, let's gather and make this dude our king over the whole country.' And legit, the house of David had no followers except for the tribe of Judah. #loyalty 21. So, when Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered all the peeps from the tribe of Judah and Benjamin – a whopping 180,000 fearless warriors – ready to battle against the house of Israel and put Rehoboam, Solomon's son, back in charge of the kingdom. 22. So God straight up messaged Shemaiah, who's a real devout dude, and He was like, 23. Yo, listen up Rehoboam, bro of Solomon, king of Judah! And not just you, but also all the peeps in Judah and Benjamin, and even the leftover crowd, here's what I gotta say to ya, 24. Listen up, fam. God says, 'Don't even think about attacking your fellow Israelites. Head back home and chill, because this situation is all part of my plan.' So, these peeps actually listened to what God said and decided to bounce, just like He told them. 25. So Jeroboam decided to build up Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim and made it his crib. Then he bounced from there and also built up Penuel. 26. So Jeroboam thought to himself, like, oh great, now the kingdom's gonna go back to David's fam: 27. If these people go to worship at the LORD's crib in Jerusalem, they'll simp for Rehoboam, the king of Judah, and they'll be ready to cancel me and flock back to Rehoboam, the king of Judah. 28. So the king was like, 'Yo, I got an idea!' He gathered some peeps to help him make two lit golden calves. Then he was all like, 'Listen up, Israel! Going all the way to Jerusalem is a hassle. Check out these gods who totally brought you out of Egypt!' 29. So he placed one in Bethel, and the other in Dan. 30. And this became a problem: because people started going to worship in only one place, even all the way to Dan. 31. And he built a lit AF crib with sick views, and appointed some regular dudes as priests, even though they weren't from the crew of Levi. 32. And Jeroboam threw a lit party in the eighth month, exactly on the fifteenth day, just like the fire festival they have in Judah. He went all out and offered sacrifices on the altar. He did the same in Bethel, sacrificing to the handmade idols he had made. He even put his own team of priests in charge of the high places he created. 33. So he went up to the altar he made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a totally made-up month that he came up with himself. He threw a party for the Israeli kids and burnt incense on the altar. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 121. And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king. 2. And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard {of it}, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 3. That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, 4. Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee. 5. And he said unto them, Depart yet {for} three days, then come again to me. And the people departed. 6. And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people? 7. And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever. 8. But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, {and} which stood before him: 9. And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter? 10. And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou {it} lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little {finger} shall be thicker than my father's loins. 11. And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 12. So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day. 13. And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men's counsel that they gave him; {roughly: Heb. hardly} 14. And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father {also} chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 15. Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 16. So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither {have we} inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents. 17. But {as for} the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 18. Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who {was} over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. {made...: Heb. strengthened himself} 19. So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. {rebelled: or, fell away} 20. And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only. 21. And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 22. But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 23. Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 24. Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD. 25. Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel. 26. And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David: 27. If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, {even} unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah. 28. Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves {of} gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 29. And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. 30. And this thing became a sin: for the people went {to worship} before the one, {even} unto Dan. 31. And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. 32. And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that {is} in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made. {offered...: or, went up to the altar, etc} {sacrificing: or, to sacrifice} 33. So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, {even} in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense. {offered...: or, went up to the altar, etc} {and burnt...: Heb. to burn incense} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 131. Yo, check it out, this dude who's tight with God came from Judah rollin' with a message straight from the LORD to Bethel. Jeroboam was chillin' by the altar, 'bout to light up some incense, ya feel? 2. And he totally called out the altar like, in the word of the LORD, and was like, yo altar, listen up! This is what the LORD says - get ready, 'cause a child named Josiah is gonna be born into the house of David. And guess what? He's gonna straight up offer those priests who burn incense on you, and even burn men's bones on you, okay? It's gonna go down, no joke. 3. So, like, this dude was all like, 'Yo, check it out! God said there's gonna be a sick sign today. The altar is gonna straight up split in half, and all the ashes on it are gonna spill out.' 4. So, like, King Jeroboam heard what the man of God said when he was calling out the altar in Bethel. And then he got all upset and stretched out his hand from the altar, telling his dudes to grab the man. But, surprise surprise, his hand dried up and he couldn't pull it back to himself anymore. 5. Yo, peep this: the altar straight up got wrecked, and the ashes just spilled out all over the place, just like the dude of God said would happen 'cause of the word of the LORD. 6. Then the king replied to the man of God, like, 'Yo, could you please ask your God and pray for me, so that my hand can be healed and all? And the man of God prayed to the Lord, and boom, the king's hand was totally restored and back to normal, just like before! 7. And the king was like, hey, dude of God, come chill at my crib and take a break, and I'll hook you up with a sick prize. 8. The man of God straight up told the king, like, bro, if you're down to give me half of your crib, I'm still not vibin' with you. I ain't eatin' or drinkin' anything in this spot. 9. The LORD told me not to eat or drink anything, and not to go back the same way I came. 10. So he took a different path, and didn't go back the way he came to Bethel. 11. So, there was this OG prophet chilling in Bethel. And his sons peeped all the epic stuff the man of God pulled off that day in Bethel: they spilled the tea on the boss words he dropped on the king, and they made sure to tell their pops about it too. 12. And their dad was like, yo, which way did that dude go? 'Cause his sons peeped where the man of God went, who came from Judah. 13. And he was like, yo sons, get me that donkey. So they hooked him up with the donkey, and he rode off on it, 14. So, they chased after the man of God and, like, totally found him chilling under this huge oak tree. And they're like, 'Yo, are you that dude who came all the way from Judah and stuff?' And the man of God's like, 'Yeah, bruh, that's me.' 15. And he was like, 'Yo, come chill at my crib and grub some bread.' 16. And he's like, 'Nah, I can't roll with you or chill with you: I won't even grab a bite or sip water with you here.' 17. The LORD told me not to eat any bread or drink water there and not to go back the way I came. 18. He was like, 'Dude, I'm a prophet just like you. And an angel came to me, straight from the LORD, saying, 'Take him back to your place so he can have some food and water.' But he totally lied to him. 19. So he went with him, and they grabbed a bite to eat at his place, and chilled with some water. 20. So, like, they were just chilling at the table when the LORD straight up spoke to the prophet who brought him back: 21. And he called out to the dude of God who came from Judah, like, 'Yo, the LORD says, because you straight up ignored what He said and didn't do the commandment He gave you, 22. But like, you totally turned back and went and had some food and drinks at that spot even though the Lord clearly told you not to, saying 'Don't eat any bread or drink any water', and now you won't even have a proper burial alongside your ancestors, man. 23. And it happened, after he finished chowing down and guzzling, he got the ride ready, specifically for the prophet he had brought back. 24. Yo, so this dude was just minding his own business, when out of nowhere, a lion rolls up and straight up takes him out. The guy's dead body gets thrown onto the road, and his poor donkey just stands there next to it, while the lion hangs around too. 25. So, like, these dudes were walking and they saw a dead body just chilling on the road, and there was a lion hanging around near it. They were like, 'Yo, we gotta tell the old prophet who lives in the city about this, it's crazy!' 26. And when the prophet who brought him back heard about it, he said, 'Yo, it's the man of God who straight up ignored the word of the LORD. So the LORD let him be taken by a lion, which totally ripped him apart, just like the LORD said it would.' 27. And he was like, yo, kids! Get the donkey ready. So they hooked the donkey up, just like he asked, no questions asked. 28. So he went and came across his dead body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing next to it. The lion hadn't eaten the body and hadn't harmed the donkey either. {torn: in Hebrew, it means broken} 29. So the prophet picked up the dead body of the man of God and placed it on the donkey, then took it back. And the older prophet went to the city to grieve and give him a proper burial. 30. And he put his body in his own grave; and they were really sad about it, like, 'Oh no, my bro!' 31. So, once he finished burying him, he had a chat with his kids and said, 'Listen up, when I kick the bucket, make sure to bury me in the same tomb where that holy dude was buried. Put my bones right next to his bones, alright?' 32. Like, the word of the LORD totally came true, man! He was all like, 'Yo, check it out! This altar in Bethel and all those fancy high places in the Samaria cities? They're gonna get some serious consequences, no doubt!' 33. After all that, Jeroboam didn't change his evil ways. Instead, he started appointing random dudes from the common folk as priests in the fancy spots. Basically, anyone who wanted the gig got it, and they became priests in those fancy spots. 34. And this action became a sin for the fam of Jeroboam, so much so that it had to be eliminated and wiped out completely. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 131. And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense. {burn: or, offer} 2. And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee. 3. And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This {is} the sign which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that {are} upon it shall be poured out. 4. And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him. 5. The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD. 6. And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as {it was} before. {the LORD, and: Heb. the face of the LORD, etc} 7. And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward. 8. And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place: 9. For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest. 10. So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Bethel. 11. Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father. 12. And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah. 13. And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass: and he rode thereon, 14. And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, {Art} thou the man of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I {am}. 15. Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread. 16. And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: 17. For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest. {it...: Heb. a word was} 18. He said unto him, I {am} a prophet also as thou {art}; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. {But} he lied unto him. 19. So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water. 20. And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: 21. And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 22. But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which {the LORD} did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers. 23. And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, {to wit}, for the prophet whom he had brought back. 24. And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by the carcase. 25. And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told {it} in the city where the old prophet dwelt. 26. And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard {thereof}, he said, It {is} the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him. {torn: Heb. broken} 27. And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled {him}. 28. And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the ass. {torn: Heb. broken} 29. And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn and to bury him. 30. And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, {saying}, Alas, my brother! 31. And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God {is} buried; lay my bones beside his bones: 32. For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which {are} in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass. 33. After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became {one} of the priests of the high places. {made...: Heb. returned and made} {consecrated...: Heb. filled his hand} 34. And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut {it} off, and to destroy {it} from off the face of the earth. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 141. This one time, Abijah, son of Jeroboam, got really sick. 2. And Jeroboam was like, yo wifey, you gotta rock a sick disguise so nobody knows you're Mrs. Jeroboam. Go to Shiloh, 'cause that's where Ahijah the prophet is at. He's the one who said I was gonna be king over this crew. 3. Grab ten loaves, some yummy cracknels, and a bottle of honey. Go to him and he'll spill the tea on what's gonna happen to the kid. 4. So Jeroboam's wife followed the plan and got up to go to Shiloh, where she went to Ahijah's house. But Ahijah couldn't see because his eyesight had weakened with age. 5. Yo, the LORD told Ahijah, listen up, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to ask you something for her son 'cause he's sick. This is what you gotta say to her: when she comes in, she should pretend to be someone else. 6. So, like, Ahijah hears her footsteps at the door and he's all like, 'Come on in, you're Jeroboam's wife, why you pretending to be someone else?' 'Cause I got some serious stuff to tell ya, it's not gonna be easy to hear. 7. Yo, go and spread the word to Jeroboam. This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, is saying: 'Yo, I totally lifted you up from the crowd and appointed you as the ruler over my peeps, Israel.' 8. And took the kingdom from David's family and gave it to you. But you haven't been like my dude David, who totally obeyed me and gave me his full loyalty, only doing what I thought was right. 9. But you seriously messed up more than anyone before you: you went ahead and created your own gods, and even made statues of them, just to get on my nerves and totally disrespected me. 10. Yo, check it out - I'm about to bring some serious trouble to Jeroboam's crib. I'm gonna wipe out anyone who thinks they're the king and also those left in Israel. I'll straight up remove any trace of Jeroboam's family, like how a person gets rid of stinky junk until it's all gone. 11. Whoever dies from Jeroboam in the city, the dogs will eat them; and whoever dies in the field, the birds of the air will eat them. Because the LORD said so. 12. So, like, go back to your house. And once you step foot into the city, the kid's gonna kick the bucket. 13. And all of Israel will be sad and lay him to rest, because he was the only one from Jeroboam's house who will be given a proper burial. He was the only one who showed some goodness towards the LORD, the God of Israel. 14. Yo, the LORD gonna bring up a new king for Israel, who gonna take down Jeroboam's whole fam in a single day. Like, seriously, it's about to go down. 15. Like, the LORD is gonna totally teach Israel a lesson, you know? It'll be like shaking a reed in the water, but bigger. He's gonna uproot Israel from this awesome land their ancestors got, and scatter them beyond the river. Why? 'Cause they've been all about those groves and it's totally getting on the LORD's nerves. 16. And God's gonna let Israel go down the drain because of all the messed up stuff Jeroboam did, dragging the rest of Israel into sin too. 17. Then Jeroboam's wife got up, left, and went to Tirzah. And when she reached the doorway, the child passed away. 18. They laid him to rest and all of Israel grieved for him, just as the LORD had foretold through his servant Ahijah the prophet. 19. So, like, there's more stuff about what Jeroboam did, you know? Like how he was all about that war and ruling. You can find all the deets in the book that's all about the history of the kings of Israel. 20. Jeroboam was in charge for like 22 years, and then he like died and his son Nadab took over. 21. So, Rehoboam, Solomon's son, became the ruler of Judah. He was like forty-one years old when he started ruling and was in charge for like seventeen years in Jerusalem, the chosen city by the LORD from all the Israel tribes to give it His name. By the way, his mom's name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. 22. So, Judah totally messed up in God's eyes, and they made Him super jealous with all the sinful stuff they did. It was way worse than anything their ancestors ever did. 😬 23. Dude, they totally set up these epic, elevated spots for worship with all these fancy statues and groves, like, everywhere! They had them on every freakin' hill and even chillin' under every lush tree. 24. So like, you know, there were these people in the land who were into some messed up stuff, doing all the disgusting things that the other nations were doing, and just a reminder, God kicked them out of the land before His peeps, the children of Israel, moved in. 25. So, like, in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, this dude Shishak, who was like the king of Egypt, straight up showed up at Jerusalem: 26. So, like, this dude straight up just swiped all the cool stuff from the house of the LORD and the king's crib. I'm talking about all the treasure, man. And he didn't stop there, he even jacked all of Solomon's sick gold shields. Like, seriously? Talk about a major heist. 27. So king Rehoboam replaced the shields with cool bronze ones and gave them to the head of the guard, who was in charge of protecting the entrance to the king's crib. #keepingitsecure 28. So, like, when the king entered the crib of the LORD, the squad carried them and brought them back to the cool guard room. 29. Yo, there's more to Rehoboam's story, and everything he did can be found in the book of the kings of Judah. Real talk. 30. So, Rehoboam and Jeroboam were constantly beefing with each other. 31. Rehoboam passed away and was laid to rest alongside his ancestors in the city of David. His mom, Naamah, was an Ammonite. Abijam, his son, took over as king after him. (Abijam was also known as Abijah, according to the Greek translation.) \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 141. At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. 2. And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there {is} Ahijah the prophet, which told me that {I should be} king over this people. 3. And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child. {with...: Heb. in thine hand} {cracknels: or, cakes} {cruse: or, bottle} 4. And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. {were...: Heb. stood for his hoariness} 5. And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he {is} sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself {to be} another {woman}. 6. And it was {so}, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself {to be} another? for I {am} sent to thee {with} heavy {tidings}. {heavy: Heb. hard} 7. Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people Israel, 8. And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and {yet} thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do {that} only {which was} right in mine eyes; 9. But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: 10. Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, {and} him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone. 11. Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken {it}. 12. Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: {and} when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die. 13. And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found {some} good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. 14. Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now. 15. For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger. 16. And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made Israel to sin. 17. And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: {and} when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; 18. And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. 19. And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they {are} written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 20. And the days which Jeroboam reigned {were} two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead. {slept: Heb. lay down} 21. And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam {was} forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name {was} Naamah an Ammonitess. 22. And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done. 23. For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree. {images: or, standing images, or, statues} 24. And there were also sodomites in the land: {and} they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 25. And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, {that} Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: 26. And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made. 27. And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed {them} unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house. {guard: Heb. runners} 28. And it was {so}, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber. 29. Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 30. And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all {their} days. 31. And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name {was} Naamah an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead. {Abijam: also called, Abijah: Gr. Abia} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 151. So, like, in the eighteenth year that king Jeroboam, Nebat's son, was ruling, this dude Abijam became the king of Judah. 2. He was king of Jerusalem for three years. His mom's name was Maachah, she was Abishalom's daughter. Maachah was also known as Michaiah, daughter of Uriel. Abishalom was also called Absalom. 3. And he, like, totally followed in his father's footsteps, doing all the same wrong stuff, ya know? And his heart wasn't, like, fully committed to the LORD his God, you know, like how David his father's heart was. 4. But yo, for real, the LORD his God gave David a lit lamp in Jerusalem, to make sure his son could take over and keep Jerusalem steady. (lamp can also mean candle, just fyi) 5. Yo, David was totally on point in the eyes of the LORD. He never went off track from anything the big guy commanded him to do throughout his life, except for that whole situation with Uriah the Hittite. 6. So Rehoboam and Jeroboam were constantly beefing throughout their whole lives. 7. Hey, do you want to know more about Abijam? Well, for all the juicy deets and everything he did, you gotta check out the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah. Oh, and just so you know, there was some serious war going on between Abijam and Jeroboam. 8. And Abijam passed away; they laid him to rest in the city of David, and his son Asa took over as ruler. 9. So like, in the twelfth grade year of Jeroboam being the king of Israel, Asa became the ruler of Judah. 10. So this dude ruled in Jerusalem for a solid 41 years. And his mom, Maachah, was the daughter of Abishalom. Just a little FYI, when I say mom, I mean grandma. 11. And Asa was totally on point in the eyes of the LORD, just like his dad David. 12. So he got rid of all the people into some messed up stuff and destroyed all the cheesy statues that his ancestors had created. 13. And even his mom, Maachah, he totally dethroned her 'cause she went and made a super lame idol in the grove. Asa straight up destroyed that idol and burned it by the brook Kidron. 14. But like, those high places were still there, you know? But hey, Asa was totally keeping it real with the LORD every single day, no cap. 15. So, he brought all the stuff his dad had dedicated, and the stuff he himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD. The goodies included silver, gold, and fancy items. {things: Hebrew for holy} 16. So, Asa and Baasha, the kings of Israel, were at constant odds and engaged in warfare throughout their reigns. 17. So Baasha, the king of Israel, decided to go against Judah and built a stronghold in Ramah to block any incoming or outgoing traffic to King Asa of Judah. 18. So Asa gathered up all the leftover cash and bling from the Lord's crib and his own crib, and gave it to his homies. Then King Asa sent his homies to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, who was the boss of Syria living in Damascus, and he said, 19. Yo, we cool, right? My pops and your pops, they tight too. Check it, I'm sending you some sick bling, silver and gold. Come through, let's cancel that deal you got with Baasha, the king of Israel, so he backs off. Word. 20. So Benhadad listened to king Asa and sent his army captains to attack the cities of Israel. They successfully struck Ijon, Dan, Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, along with the entire land of Naphtali. 21. And when Baasha found out, he stopped building Ramah and moved to Tirzah. 22. So, like, King Asa got everyone in Judah to listen up, no one was left out, and they took those stones from Ramah and the wood that Baasha used to build, and King Asa used them to build Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah. Cool, right? No one was left out, you know? 23. Yo, there's still a bunch of cool stuff that Asa did, like his sick moves, and all the things he pulled off, not to mention the awesome cities he built. You can find all the deets in the book of records about the kings of Judah. But, like, when he got old, his feet got all messed up and he was dealing with some health issues. 24. And Asa passed away and was buried in the same city as his ancestors, David his father. Afterward, his son Jehoshaphat became the new ruler. {Jehoshaphat: AKA Josaphat in Greek} 25. So, Nadab, Jeroboam's son, took over as the ruler of Israel in the second year of Asa's reign over Judah. He ruled Israel for a total of two years.  26. And he totally messed up in God's eyes, like, he followed his father's lead and indulged in the same sinful behavior that caused all of Israel to go astray. 27. So, there's this guy named Baasha, son of Ahijah from the Issachar fam, and he straight up plotted against another guy. Baasha went ahead and totally wrecked him at Gibbethon, which was like Philistine territory or whatever. You see, Nadab and all of Israel were just chilling, laying siege and everything, to Gibbethon. 28. During Asa's third year as king of Judah, Baasha came and straight up took him out, becoming the new ruler. 29. And like, when he was in charge, he totally wiped out the whole fam of Jeroboam. Like, he made sure no one was left, until he completely took him down, just like how the LORD said through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 30. Because Jeroboam did a bunch of messed up stuff that made both himself and Israel trip up, and as a result, he totally ticked off the LORD God of Israel, sending Him into rage mode. 31. So, like, all the other stuff Nadab did, you can find it written in the book of the kings of Israel, ya know? 32. So Asa and Baasha, the kings of Israel, were at war with each other throughout their reigns. 33. In Asa's third year as king of Judah, Baasha, Ahijah's son, took over as ruler of all Israel in Tirzah, and he ruled for twenty-four years. 34. And he was not good in God's eyes, and followed the path of Jeroboam, and committed the same wrongdoing that led Israel astray. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 151. Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned Abijam over Judah. 2. Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. {Maachah...: also called, Michaiah the daughter of Uriel} {Abishalom: also called, Absalom} 3. And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of David his father. 4. Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem: {lamp: or, candle} 5. Because David did {that which was} right in the eyes of the LORD, and turned not aside from any {thing} that he commanded him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. 6. And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. 7. Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 8. And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. 9. And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah. 10. And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. {mother's: that is, grandmother's} 11. And Asa did {that which was} right in the eyes of the LORD, as {did} David his father. 12. And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. 13. And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from {being} queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol, and burnt {it} by the brook Kidron. {destroyed: Heb. cut off} 14. But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart was perfect with the LORD all his days. 15. And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels. {things: Heb. holy} 16. And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 17. And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 18. Then Asa took all the silver and the gold {that were} left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 19. {There is} a league between me and thee, {and} between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me. {depart: Heb. go up} 20. So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 21. And it came to pass, when Baasha heard {thereof}, that he left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. 22. Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none {was} exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah. {exempted: Heb. free} 23. The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did, and the cities which he built, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet. 24. And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead. {Jehoshaphat: Gr. Josaphat} 25. And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years. {began...: Heb. reigned} 26. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. 27. And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which {belonged} to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon. 28. Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead. 29. And it came to pass, when he reigned, {that} he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 30. Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger. 31. Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 32. And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. 33. In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years. 34. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 161. So, like, God was all like, 'Yo, Jehu, check it. I got a message for you about Baasha, bro. 2. Dude, I totally lifted you up from the bottom and made you the big boss over my peeps in Israel. But like, you went and followed in Jeroboam's footsteps and got my people all messed up, making them sin and ticking me off with all their wickedness. 3. Yo, listen up! I'm gonna totally wipe out Baasha's descendants and the whole line of his family. Then I'll make your crib just like Jeroboam, Nebat's son, no cap. 4. Those who die in the city of Baasha will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the fields will be eaten by birds of the air. 5. Yo, you wanna know more about Baasha and all the stuff he pulled off? Check out the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel, fam. It's got all the deets on his acts, his epic moves, and his straight-up power. 6. And Baasha passed away, joining his ancestors, and was laid to rest in Tirzah. Then his son Elah became king in his place. 7. And like, the prophet Jehu, Hanani's son, totally received a message from the LORD about Baasha and his fam. And let me tell you, Baasha had done some seriously messed up stuff in the eyes of the LORD. He was all up in God's face, with the things he was doing and the way he was acting, just like Jeroboam's crew. Oh, and by the way, Baasha straight up killed Jeroboam too. 8. In like, the 26th year of Asa, the king of Judah, Elah, dude, the son of Baasha, took over as ruler of Israel in Tirzah, and he, like ruled for two years, man. 9. And then Zimri, the cool dude in charge of half his sick chariots, totally plotted against him while he was chilling in Tirzah, getting wasted in the crib of Arza, the manager of his house in Tirzah. #sneaky 10. So Zimri went in and, like, totally attacked him and ended up killing him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa ruling over Judah, and he became the new ruler and everything. 11. So, like, once this guy became king and sat on his throne, he totally wiped out the entire household of Baasha. Seriously, not a single person was spared, not even his relatives or friends. Like, it was a complete annihilation, bro. 12. So Zimri totally wiped out Baasha's whole crib, just like the message from the Big Man himself, spoken through Jehu the prophet. (FYI, Jehu was like the messenger boy for the LORD). 13. Like, Baasha and his son Elah were totally caught up in their sinful ways, and they got Israel hooked too! They seriously ticked off the LORD God of Israel with all their pointless and empty actions. 14. Yo, like, if you wanna know more dope stuff Elah did, check out the book of the kings of Israel. It's got all the juicy deets and everything! 15. So, like, in the 27th year of Asa being king of Judah, this dude Zimri became king for, like, a whole week in this place called Tirzah. And the people were all like camping out near this place called Gibbethon, which was, like, owned by the Philistines or whatever. 16. So, like, the peeps who were camping, they heard this tea that Zimri was plotting and he straight up killed the king. So, all of Israel decided to make Omri, the boss of the squad, the king of Israel right then and there in the camp. 17. So, Omri and all the cool peeps in Israel rolled out of Gibbethon and decided to lay down some serious siege action on Tirzah. 18. So, like, Zimri peeped that the city got taken, and he was like, 'nah, not today,' and straight up headed to the king's crib, and straight up set fire to the king's house and himself, and that's how he met his end. 19. Because he messed up and did a lot of bad stuff that went against what God wanted, following in the messed-up footsteps of Jeroboam. And he didn't stop there, he went ahead and made all of Israel mess up too. 20. Yo, there's more juicy deets about Zimri and all the sketchy stuff he pulled. You can find all the tea in the book that's filled with stories about the kings of Israel, ya know what I'm sayin'? 21. So, like, Israel was totally split into two groups: one side was all about Tibni, Ginath's son, and, like, they wanted to make him king. But the other side was all about Omri, you know? And they were like, 'Omri for the win!' 22. But the squad that rolled with Omri totally crushed Tibni's crew, son of Ginath. So Tibni croaked and Omri took over the throne. 23. In the thirty-first year of Asa being king of Judah, Omri came to power as the ruler of Israel. He reigned for twelve years, with six of those years spent ruling from Tirzah. 24. So he copped the Samaria hill from Shemer for two silver talents, then he straight up built a city on that hill and named it Samaria, after Shemer who owned the hill. {Samaria: Hebrew for Shomeron} 25. But Omri was seriously problematic in the eyes of the LORD, and he did even worse stuff than anyone who came before him. 26. Because he totally followed the footsteps of Jeroboam, Nebat's son, and committed the same sinful acts that led all of Israel astray. This obviously made the Almighty God of Israel pretty mad, thanks to their obsession with worthless stuff. 27. Yo, you wanna know about all the other cool things Omri did and how strong he was? Check out the book of Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, it's all written there, no cap! 28. And then Omri passed away and was buried in Samaria. So Ahab, his son, took over as the ruler. 29. So, like, in the 38th year when Asa was ruling Judah, this dude Ahab, who's Omri's son, took over as the king of Israel. And get this, Ahab ruled over Israel in Samaria for a solid 22 years, man! 30. Ahab, the son of Omri, straight up messed up big time in the eyes of the LORD, like worse than anyone before him. 31. And it happened, like it was no big deal to him, he started following the sinful ways of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat. He even married Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, who was the king of the Zidonians. He went on to worship Baal, dedicating his life to serving him. 32. And he built a sick altar for Baal in the totally lit house of Baal, which he flexed in Samaria. 33. So, like, Ahab goes and sets up this grove thing, and honestly, he totally takes it to the next level by pissing off the LORD God of Israel way more than any other king before him. Like, the dude really knows how to push buttons, you know? 34. Back in the day, this guy named Hiel from Bethel went and built Jericho. He laid down the foundations using his firstborn son, Abiram, and set up the gates with his youngest son, Segub. Why, you ask? Well, it was all because of a word from the LORD that was spoken through Joshua, the son of Nun. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 161. Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, 2. Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; 3. Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 4. Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat. 5. Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 6. So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead. 7. And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him. 8. In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. 9. And his servant Zimri, captain of half {his} chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza steward of {his} house in Tirzah. {steward...: Heb. which was over} 10. And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead. 11. And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, {that} he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends. {neither...: or, both his kinsmen and his friends} 12. Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, {by: Heb. by the hand of} 13. For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 14. Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 15. In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people {were} encamped against Gibbethon, which {belonged} to the Philistines. 16. And the people {that were} encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. 17. And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. 18. And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died, 19. For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin. 20. Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 21. Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. 22. But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. 23. In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah. 24. And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria. {Samaria: Heb. Shomeron} 25. But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that {were} before him. 26. For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. 27. Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 28. So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead. 29. And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. 30. And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that {were} before him. 31. And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him. {as if...: Heb. was it a light thing, etc} 32. And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. 33. And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him. 34. In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest {son} Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 171. Yo, Elijah from Gilead, the Tishbite, straight up told Ahab, the king, as long as the LORD God of Israel is legit, and I'm here representing Him, there ain't gonna be any dew or rain for a few years, and that's on me. 2. Yo, the LORD dropped a message for him, like, 3. Yo, like, go away from here and head east, then find a chill spot by the brook Cherith, you know, the one in front of Jordan river. 4. Yo, listen up! Get this, fam: You gonna sip from that stream, and guess what? I've straight up told those ravens to hook you up with snacks, right there. 5. So he did what God said and went to live by this cool stream called Cherith, right before the Jordan River. It was lit. 6. And those ravens, like, totally hooked him up with bread and meat in the morning and evening, and he quenched his thirst from the brook. 7. So, after some time, the brook totally dried up because there was no rain at all in the whole land. #DrySeasonAlert 😬 8. God slid into his DMs, saying, 9. Yo, get up and head to Zarephath, you know, that place near Zidon. Settle down there because I've specifically told a widow in that area to take care of you. Trust me, it's gonna be all good! 10. So he got up and went to Zarephath. And when he arrived at the entrance of the city, he saw a widow woman gathering sticks there. He called out to her and said, 'Yo, can you get me a little water in a cup so I can quench my thirst?' 11. As she was heading over to get it, he called out to her and said, 'Hey, can you please bring me a piece of bread?' 12. And she was like, 'OMG, I swear on God's name, I don't have a cake or anything fancy, just a tiny bit of meal in a container and a little oil in a bottle. Like, I'm literally out here picking up two sticks so I can make a fire and cook it for me and my son, so that we can eat it and survive.' 13. So Elijah was like, 'Chill, don't be scared. Go ahead and do what you said, but whip up a small cake for me first, then bring it to me. After that, go ahead and make some for yourself and your son.' 14. Listen up, fam! The big man upstairs, AKA the LORD God of Israel, has got your back. He's saying that your meal stash won't run out and your oil supply won't dry up until He blesses us with rain. No cap! 💯 15. So she went and did what Elijah said: and both she and Elijah and everyone in her house had food for a long time. They feasted for days on end. It was a bountiful year of feasting. 16. And the supply of food never ran out, and the oil bottle never went empty, just like the LORD had said through Elijah. 17. So like, after all this stuff went down, the son of the woman who owned the place got really sick. And I mean, he was sick to the point where he couldn't even breathe anymore. It was intense. 18. And she was like, OMG Elijah, why you gotta bring up my past and make me feel guilty? Are you here just to remind me of my mistakes and make my son suffer? 19. And he was like, 'Yo, hand me your son.' So he grabbed the kid from her and took him up to this chill loft where he stayed, and gently put him on his own bed. 20. So, like, he prayed to the LORD and was like, 'Yo, LORD my God, did you, like, totally make bad stuff happen to the widow I've been hanging out with by making her son die?' 21. So, like, he laid down on the kid three times and was like, yelling to God, and saying, 'Hey, God, please, like, bring this kid's soul back to him.' {stretched: means measured or, like, extended} {into...: means into his inward parts or, like, deep inside him} 22. And OMG, God totally heard Elijah callin' out, and the kid's soul was like back in him, and he came alive again. It was lit! 23. And Elijah took the kid, and brought him down from the room into the crib, and gave him back to his mom: and Elijah was like, yo, check it out, your son is alive. 24. And the woman was like, OMG Elijah, I totally believe you're a legit man of God. The stuff you say, straight from the Lord's mouth, it's all facts. No cap. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 171. And Elijah the Tishbite, {who was} of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, {As} the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word. {Elijah: Heb. Elijahu: Gr. Elias} 2. And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 3. Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that {is} before Jordan. 4. And it shall be, {that} thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there. 5. So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that {is} before Jordan. 6. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. 7. And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there had been no rain in the land. {after...: Heb. at the end of days} 8. And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 9. Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which {belongeth} to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. {Zarephath: Gr. Sarepta} 10. So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman {was} there gathering of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. 11. And as she was going to fetch {it}, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. 12. And she said, {As} the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I {am} gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die. 13. And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go {and} do as thou hast said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring {it} unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son. 14. For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day {that} the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. {sendeth: Heb. giveth} 15. And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he, and her house, did eat {many} days. {many...: or, a full year} 16. {And} the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah. {by: Heb. by the hand of} 17. And it came to pass after these things, {that} the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him. 18. And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son? 19. And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed. 20. And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? 21. And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child's soul come into him again. {stretched: Heb. measured} {into...: Heb. into his inward parts} 22. And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived. 23. And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son liveth. 24. And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou {art} a man of God, {and} that the word of the LORD in thy mouth {is} truth. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 181. After a while, the LORD spoke to Elijah, after three years, and said, 'Yo, go find Ahab and I'll make it rain on the earth.' 2. So Elijah went to meet up with Ahab. And dude, there was a serious famine going on in Samaria. 3. So Ahab reached out to Obadiah, who was in charge of his house. (By the way, Obadiah was totally devoted to the LORD; his Hebrew name is Obadiahu.) Also, just to clarify, Obadiah was the boss of Ahab's crib. 4. Back in the day, when Jezebel straight up wiped out all the LORD's prophets, Obadiah came in clutch. He saved a hundred prophets and hid them in groups of fifty in a secret cave, making sure they were fed with bread and water. (BTW, Jezebel's real name in Hebrew is Izebel, just an FYI) 5. Ahab was like, 'Yo Obadiah, go check out all the water sources and streams in the land. Maybe we can find some grass to keep our horses and mules alive, so we don't end up losing all our animals. You know, we don't wanna cut ourselves off from them, man.' 6. So they split up the land between them and decided to explore it separately: Ahab went his own way, and Obadiah took a different path for himself. 7. While Obadiah was on his way, he suddenly ran into Elijah and recognized him. Overwhelmed with awe, he bowed down and said, 'Dude, are you the one and only Elijah?' 8. And he was like, yo, tell your boss, like, guess who's here? Elijah, bro. 9. And he's like, yo, what did I do wrong that made you wanna give me to Ahab to kill me? 10. I swear on everything, God is out here sending people from all over to find you. They be saying you ain't around, but my guy made sure to make a big deal out of it and made everyone swear that they couldn't find you in any nation or kingdom. 11. And now you're like, 'Dude, go tell your boss, guess what? Elijah's in the house!' 12. Like, once I bounce, the Spirit of the LORD will take you somewhere, I don't even know where. Then, when I go and tell Ahab, and he can't find you, he'll totally kill me. But, like, I've been fearing the LORD since I was young, you know? 13. Yo, didn't I tell you, my dude, how I held it down when Jezebel took out all them prophets? I straight up hid a hundred of the LORD's prophets, splitting 'em fifty-fifty, in a cave and hooked them up with bread and water. 14. And now you're like, 'Go tell your boss, Elijah's here and he's gonna kill me.' 15. And Elijah was like, I swear on God's name who has ultimate power, and I'm standing here in front of Him, that I'm definitely going to reveal myself to that guy today. 16. So Obadiah was like, 'Yo, Ahab, listen up!' And Ahab was like, 'What's good?' And then Ahab rolled up to meet Elijah. 17. So, like, when Ahab spotted Elijah, he was all like, 'Yo, dude! Are you the one causing all this chaos in Israel?' 18. And he was like, 'Dude, it's not my fault that things are messed up in Israel. It's totally you and your fam's fault for ditching God's commandments and going after Baalim. 19. So like, go ahead and gather all of Israel, ya know, to mount Carmel and bring the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of the groves, who totally have their fancy meals with Jezebel and all. 20. So Ahab hit up all the Israelite homies and invited the prophets to roll through to Mount Carmel. 21. So, Elijah pulled up to the crowd and was like, 'Yo, how long you gonna be indecisive? If the LORD is the real deal, then show some loyalty. But if you're all about Baal, then go ahead and follow him.' And you know what? The people didn't even say a word. Silence, bro. 22. So Elijah was like, 'Yo, listen up everyone! I'm, like, the only prophet left who reps the LORD. But those dudes who worship Baal? They got, like, four hundred and fifty prophets.' 23. Yo, tell them to bring us two bullocks. And then they can choose one for themselves, cut it up and put it on the wood, but don't light it up or anything. I'll take care of the other bullock, put it on the wood, and no need to ignite it either. 24. Yo, go ahead and holla at your gods, and I'll be calling on the name of the LORD. We'll see which God responds with fire and that's the real deal. And all the peeps said, 'That's a solid plan, fam.' 25. So Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, 'Alright, listen up, guys. Pick a bull for yourselves and get it ready. Since there are a lot of you, go ahead and call on your gods, but don't light any fire.' 26. So, they grabbed the bullock they were given, got it all ready, and began calling out to Baal like crazy from morning to noon, like 'Yo, Baal, listen up!' But guess what? Baal didn't say a word, didn't even text back. They even started jumping around on the altar they made in desperation. 27. And in the middle of the day, Elijah started to tease them, saying, 'Shout louder! Maybe your god is on the phone, or on a road trip, or taking a nap and needs to be woken up.' 28. They were screaming and started cutting themselves with knives and sharp objects, causing their blood to gush out. (The blood was literally pouring out of them.) 29. So, like, it happened when it was already past noon and they kept on prophesying until the time when they were about to offer the evening sacrifice. But, dude, there was no voice, no one to answer, no one to pay attention. It was like crickets, man. 30. And Elijah was like, 'Yo, all y'all come over here.' So the people gathered around him. And he totally fixed up the altar of the LORD that was all messed up. 31. So Elijah grabbed twelve stones, like for each of the tribes of Jacob's offspring, because God had told him that Israel was gonna be their name, you know? 32. So, he used the stones to flex and build an epic altar in the name of the LORD. And to level up the altar game, he dug a huge trench around it, big enough to hold two whole measures of seed. 33. Then he arranged the wood, diced the bullock, and placed it on the wood. He commanded, 'Get four barrels and totally drench the burnt sacrifice and the wood with water.' 34. And he was like, 'Yo, do it again. And they were like, 'Bet, let's do it again.' And he was like, 'Okay, one more time.' And they were like, 'Sure, let's do it one last time.' 35. And the water totally surrounded the altar, and he even filled the trench with water. {went: means water was flowing} 36. So, like, when it was time for the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet came up and was like, 'Yo, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let everyone know today that you're the real deal in Israel and that I'm your servant and I've totally done all this stuff because you told me to.' 37. Listen up, LORD, listen up, so that these peeps can know that you're the one and only LORD God and that you've totally helped them get their hearts back on track. 38. And then, like, a massive fire from the LORD came down and totally burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, the dust, and even drank up all the water that was in the trench. It was insane! 39. And when everyone saw what happened, they were completely shook and dropped to the floor. They were like, 'OMG, the LORD is the boss, like the ultimate God, no doubt about it. The LORD, like, totally rules! 40. And Elijah was like, yo, grab all those prophets of Baal, don't let any of them get away. So they caught them and Elijah took them to the brook Kishon and straight up took them out there. 41. Yo, Ahab, get up and grab some food and drinks! I'm telling you, there's about to be a crazy rainstorm coming in. Like, you can already hear the sound of it, man! 42. So Ahab was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna go eat and drink.' And Elijah was all like, 'I'm heading up to the top of Carmel,' and he straight up flung himself down on the ground, with his face buried between his knees. 43. Then he told his servant, 'Yo, head up and peep at the sea.' So his servant went up, checked it out, and was like, 'Nah, nothing there.' But the boss was like, 'Nah, try again, bro. Seven times.' 44. So, like, after trying seven times, this dude was like, 'Yo, check it out, there's, like, this small cloud rising from the sea, like it's the size of a dude's hand.' And he was like, 'Go tell Ahab, get your ride ready and head down before you get caught in the rain.' 45. So, like, it happened in the meantime, the sky got all dark with clouds and wind, and it started pouring like crazy. And Ahab, he hopped on his ride and headed to Jezreel. 46. The LORD empowered Elijah, and he got ready and sprinted ahead of Ahab all the way to the entrance of Jezreel. {to the...: Means until he reached Jezreel} \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 181. And it came to pass {after} many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth. 2. And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And {there was} a sore famine in Samaria. 3. And Ahab called Obadiah, which {was} the governor of {his} house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: {Obadiah: Heb. Obadiahu} {the governor...: Heb. over his house} 4. For it was {so}, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.) {Jezebel: Heb. Izebel} 5. And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. {that...: Heb. that we cut not off ourselves from the beasts} 6. So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself. 7. And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, {Art} thou that my lord Elijah? 8. And he answered him, I {am}: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}. 9. And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? 10. {As} the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, {He is} not {there}; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not. 11. And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}. 12. And it shall come to pass, {as soon as} I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and {so} when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth. 13. Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD'S prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water? 14. And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah {is here}: and he shall slay me. 15. And Elijah said, {As} the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day. 16. So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah. 17. And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, {Art} thou he that troubleth Israel? 18. And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim. 19. Now therefore send, {and} gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table. 20. So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel. 21. And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD {be} God, follow him: but if Baal, {then} follow him. And the people answered him not a word. {opinions: or, thoughts} 22. Then said Elijah unto the people, I, {even} I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets {are} four hundred and fifty men. 23. Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay {it} on wood, and put no fire {under}: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay {it} on wood, and put no fire {under}: 24. And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken. {It is...: Heb. The word is good} 25. And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress {it} first; for ye {are} many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire {under}. 26. And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed {it}, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But {there was} no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. {hear: or, answer} {answered: or, heard} {leaped...: or, leaped up and down at the altar} 27. And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he {is} a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, {or} peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked. {aloud: Heb. with a great voice} {he is talking: or, he meditateth} {is pursuing: Heb. hath a pursuit} 28. And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. {the blood...: Heb. poured out blood upon them} 29. And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the {time} of the offering of the {evening} sacrifice, that {there was} neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. {offering: Heb. ascending} {that regarded: Heb. attention} 30. And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD {that was} broken down. 31. And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name: 32. And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed. 33. And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid {him} on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour {it} on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. 34. And he said, Do {it} the second time. And they did {it} the second time. And he said, Do {it} the third time. And they did {it} the third time. 35. And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also with water. {ran: Heb. went} 36. And it came to pass at {the time of} the offering of the {evening} sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou {art} God in Israel, and {that} I {am} thy servant, and {that} I have done all these things at thy word. 37. Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou {art} the LORD God, and {that} thou hast turned their heart back again. 38. Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that {was} in the trench. 39. And when all the people saw {it}, they fell on their faces: and they said, The LORD, he {is} the God; the LORD, he {is} the God. 40. And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there. {Take: or, Apprehend} 41. And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for {there is} a sound of abundance of rain. {a sound...: or, a sound of a noise of rain} 42. So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his knees, 43. And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, {There is} nothing. And he said, Go again seven times. 44. And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare {thy chariot}, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not. {Prepare: Heb. Tie, or, Bind} 45. And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel. 46. And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel. {to the...: Heb. till thou come to Jezreel} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 191. So, like, Ahab spills the tea to Jezebel about everything Elijah pulled off, ya know? He's all like, 'Yo, Elijah totally wrecked those prophets, straight up slayed 'em with a sword.' 2. So Jezebel hit up Elijah with a message, like, swear to the gods, if I don't make your life as cursed as theirs by this time tomorrow! 3. And when he saw that, he was like, OMG! He quickly got up, ran for his life, and arrived at Beersheba, which is in Judah. He left his loyal servant there. 4. But he totally dipped into the wilderness for, like, a whole day and found a chill spot under a juniper tree. He straight up asked to peace out and be done with life, saying 'I'm over it, God, can you just end me now? I ain't no better than my ancestors, tbh. Like, seriously, for real. 5. And while he was chilling and taking a nap under a cool tree, suddenly an angel came and gently tapped him, saying, 'Yo, wake up and grab a snack.' 6. So he checked it out, and like, there was this epic cake cooking on the coals, and a container of water right next to his swag. And he totally chowed down and drank, then crashed out again. #Blessed 7. Then the LORD's angel came back again, giving him a friendly tap and saying, 'Dude, get up and grub! This journey is way too intense for you to handle on an empty stomach.' 8. Then he got up, had some grub and a drink, and journeyed for a solid forty days and nights to Horeb, the lit mount of God. 9. So, Elijah went to this cave and decided to spend the night there. And, surprise surprise, God spoke to him and asked, 'Why are you here, Elijah? What's up?'} 10. Yo, listen up, fam. I gotta keep it real with y'all. I've been mad protective of the big man upstairs, the LORD God of hosts. The Israelites straight up betrayed the promise they made with Him, breaking altars and straight-up murdering prophets. I'm telling you, I'm the last one holdin' it down for God, and now these peeps are after me, trying to end my life. 11. Then God was like, 'Yo, go out and chill on that big mountain in front of Me.' And guess what? God showed up, but not in the wind that straight up tore apart those mountains and rocks. And there was also an earthquake, but God wasn't in that either: 12. And like, right after the earthquake, there was this fire, ya know? But, like, the LORD wasn't in the fire or anything. And then, after the fire, there was, like, this super calm and soft voice, dude. 13. So like, when Elijah heard that, he was totally shook. He quickly covered his face with his cloak and stepped outside, standing at the entrance of the cave. And yo, out of nowhere, a voice came to him asking, 'Dude, what's up? What are you doing here, Elijah?' 14. So, like, I totally told him, 'Listen up, I've been super loyal and protective of the LORD God of hosts, because the Israelites straight up ditched your covenant, destroyed your altars, and killed your prophets with swords. And guess what? I'm the only one left and they're out here trying to take my life.' 15. And God was like, 'Yo, dude. Head back to the wilderness of Damascus and once you get there, go ahead and anoint Hazael as the king of Syria.' 16. You gotta anoint Jehu, Nimshi's kid, as the king of Israel. And Elisha, Shaphat's son from Abelmeholah, you gotta anoint as the prophet to take your place. (Elisha is also known as Eliseus in Greek). 17. And like, yo, the ones who manage to dodge Hazael's sword, Jehu's gonna take them down. And like, the peeps who escape from Jehu's sword, Elisha's gonna slay them. No joke! 18. But I still have seven thousand fellow Gen Zers in Israel who haven't given in to the Baal trend, the ones who haven't jumped on that bandwagon and kissed it. #keepingitreal #staytrue 19. So he went away from there and came across Elisha, son of Shaphat, who was out there plowing with a whole bunch of oxen, like twelve yokes of them. Elisha himself was working on the last one, and then Elijah just walked up to him and threw his cool cloak thingy on him. 20. And he ditched the oxen and sprinted after Elijah, and was like, 'Yo, let me just peck my mom and dad, and then I'm down to roll with you.' And Elijah was like, 'Yo, go back. What's my deal to you? #Clueless'} 21. And he bounced back from that, grabbed some farming equipment and killed a couple of oxen, cooked their meat with those same tools, and served it to the crowd. Then he got up, followed Elijah, and started serving him. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 191. And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword. 2. Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do {to me}, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time. 3. And when he saw {that}, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beersheba, which {belongeth} to Judah, and left his servant there. 4. But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I {am} not better than my fathers. {for himself: Heb. for his life} 5. And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise {and} eat. 6. And he looked, and, behold, {there was} a cake baken on the coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid him down again. {head: Heb. bolster} 7. And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise {and} eat; because the journey {is} too great for thee. 8. And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God. 9. And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word of the LORD {came} to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here, Elijah? 10. And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, {even} I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. 11. And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; {but} the LORD {was} not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; {but} the LORD {was} not in the earthquake: 12. And after the earthquake a fire; {but} the LORD {was} not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. 13. And it was {so}, when Elijah heard {it}, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, {there came} a voice unto him, and said, What doest thou here, Elijah? 14. And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, {even} I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away. 15. And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael {to be} king over Syria: 16. And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint {to be} king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt thou anoint {to be} prophet in thy room. {Elisha: Gr. Eliseus} 17. And it shall come to pass, {that} him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay. 18. Yet I have left {me} seven thousand in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him. {I have...: or, I will leave} 19. So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who {was} plowing {with} twelve yoke {of oxen} before him, and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him. 20. And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and {then} I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee? {Go...: Heb. Go return} 21. And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 201. So this dude Benhadad, the king of Syria, he got all his homies together. There were like 32 kings with him, plus a bunch of horses and chariots. Then they straight up rolled up to Samaria and started a full-on siege and war. 2. So he DM'd some messengers to Ahab, the king of Israel, slid into his city, and hit him up with this, he's like, 3. I totally own your cash, your bling, and even your squad and fam. Like, your bae goals and your squad goals are all mine, no cap. 4. And the king of Israel was like, yo king, I'm all yours, just like you said, and everything I got too. 5. And the messengers came again, and were like, yo, Benhadad is saying, even though I hit you up before, telling you to hand over your money, jewelry, and your whole fam; 6. But yo, tomorrow I'm sending my peeps to check out your crib and your servants' cribs too. And whatever looks fly to you, they'll snatch it up and take it. It's gonna be lit, trust. 7. So the ruler of Israel gathered all the older people of the land and said, 'Listen up, guys, check this out: this dude is up to no good. He reached out to me asking for my spouses, my kids, and all my valuable stuff, and I didn't refuse him!' 8. And lke, all the boomers and all the squad were like, don't even listen to what he's saying, like, don't even agree with him, you know? 9. So he told the messengers of Benhadad, 'Let my dude the king know that I got you covered with everything you asked for the first time, but I just can't do this one thing.' And the messengers bounced, then came back with the message. 10. So Benhadad DM'd him and said, I swear on the gods, and even more, if there's enough dust in Samaria for everyone who's simpin' after me. {follow...: in other words, they're all at my feet} 11. And the king of Israel was like, bruh, tell him not to flex his gear like he's already won the battle. 12. So, like, when {Benhadad} heard this text, while he was chugging drinks with the kings in the chill pavilions, he was all like, 'Yo, squad, get ready for battle!' And they all geared up, ready to attack the city. {word: Hebrew term} {pavilions: or, tents} {Set yourselves in array: or, Arrange the artillery. And they arranged the artillery}. 13. Yo, listen up! So there's this prophet who rolls up to Ahab, the king of Israel, and drops this sick message from the LORD: 'Hey, Ahab, you peeped that massive crowd over there? Well, check this out. I'm gonna hand 'em over to you today, just so you know I'm the almighty boss.' 14. Ahab was like, 'Who's gonna make this battle happen?' And the dude was like, 'Listen up, young fellas from all over are gonna lead the charge.' Ahab was like, 'Okay, but who's gonna call the shots?' And the response was, 'You, bro. You're in charge.' 15. So he like counted all the cool dudes from the important places, and there were like 232 of them. And then he counted all the peeps, like every single one of the Israelites, and there were 7,000 of them. 16. So, like, it was noon and they all went out, right? And Benhadad was totally getting wasted in the pavilions, along with the thirty-two kings who were supporting him. 17. So, like, the homies from the important places dipped out first; and Benhadad was like, 'yo, go check it out' and they came back saying, 'dude, there are guys coming from Samaria'. 18. And he was like, if they're chill and want peace, then like, capture them; or if they're all ready for a fight, still capture them. 19. So, like, these cool dudes from the cities, you know, they rolled out with their crew of fellow soldiers. 🕺🏼 20. So, like, each dude totally took out their opponent, and the Syrians straight up ran away, but Israel was all like, 'Nuh-uh, not letting you escape!' And Benhadad, the king of Syria, managed to ride away on a horse with his squad of horsemen. 21. So the king of Israel went out and totally wrecked the horses and chariots, and straight up defeated the Syrians with a massive beatdown. 22. So, like, the prophet went up to the king of Israel and was all like, 'Listen up, bro! You gotta get your act together and be on top of your game. Watch closely and figure out your next move, 'cause next year the king of Syria will totally be after you.' 23. So like, the servants of the king of Syria were like, 'Dude, their gods only work in the hills, that's why they defeated us. But if we fight them in the open plain, for sure we'll be stronger than them.' 24. Yo, listen up! It's time to make moves. Let's strip those kings of their power, kick 'em out of their thrones, and replace 'em with some badass captains! 25. Gather a squad, just as big as the squad you lost, with horses and chariots matching theirs. We're gonna go head-to-head on the battlefield, and trust me, we'll be stronger than them. And guess what? He agreed to their plan and made it happen. 26. So, at the start of the year, Benhadad counted his squad, rounded up the Syrians, and headed to Aphek for a massive battle with Israel. Yeah, you heard it right, they were ready to throw down! 27. So, like, the children of Israel, they all gathered up and got ready to face the Syrians. It was like two small groups of cute little goats coming up against them. But man, the Syrians, they just totally took over the whole place, you know? 28. So this dude who's all close to God rolls up to the king of Israel and starts saying, 'Listen up, God's like, the boss everywhere. These Syrians are dissing Him by saying He's only in charge of the hills, not the valleys. But let me tell ya, I'm gonna hand this massive army over to you. And then you'll see that I'm the real deal, the LORD. 29. They set up camp across from each other for a whole week. Then, on the seventh day, the battle began. The Israelites totally obliterated the Syrian army, taking down a whopping one hundred thousand soldiers in just one day. 30. So the others dipped out of there and went to Aphek, like, into the city and a massive wall straight up fell on twenty-seven thousand dudes who were still left. And Benhadad ran off and slipped into the city, hiding in some hidden spot, probably like a boss hideout or something. (or, like going from one fancy room to another: Hebrew says, like a secret chamber within another secret chamber) 31. So, his peeps were like, yo listen up! We've heard that the kings from Israel are all about that compassion vibe. Let's hit 'em up, like please! We'll wear these humble threads, put ropes on our heads, and roll up to the king of Israel, hoping he might just save your soul. 32. So they, like, put on these sackcloth outfits and tied ropes on their heads, and went up to the king of Israel and were all like, 'Yo, your boy Benhadad wants to live. Can you let him?'. And the king's like, 'Wait, he's still alive? He's, like, my bro!'.  33. So these guys were basically watching and waiting to see if anything would happen, and when it did, they quickly grabbed onto it. They were like, 'Yo, that's your bro Benhadad!' Then the dude was like, 'Go get him!' And just like that, Benhadad came forward and hopped into the chariot. 34. And Benhadad was like, yo dude, I'mma give back those cities my dad took from your dad. And you can have some sweet streets in Damascus, just like my dad made in Samaria. Then Ahab was all, bet, I'll send you off with this agreement. So they made a deal and Benhadad bounced. (Streets: aka market places) 35. So there was this dude, one of the prophets' crew, talking to his homie like, 'Yo, hit me up for real, fam. I'm down.' But his friend was like, 'Nah, bro. I ain't gonna hit you.' 36. And he was like, yo bro, since you didn't listen to the Lord's voice and all, check it, as soon as you leave my presence, a lion's gonna take you out. No joke, man, as soon as he bounced, a lion came across him and bam, he was done. 37. Then he came across another dude and was like, 'Yo, hit me up, bro.' And the dude straight up smacked him, leaving him with some serious bruises. 🤕 38. So the prophet bounced, and chillaxed for the king on the road, and fronted with ashes on his face. 39. And like, as the king was walking by, this dude shouted at him and was like, 'Yo, listen up king! So, I was out there in the heat of battle, right? And outta nowhere, some dude comes up to me and hands me another dude, saying I gotta keep him safe. He was like, 'If this dude goes missing, your life is gonna pay the price or you gotta cough up a whole talent of silver, bro. Like, seriously! 40. And when your boy was all over the place, he disappeared. Then the king of Israel was like, 'That's how it's gonna go down for you, my dude. You brought it upon yourself.' (FYI, dude totally vanished!) 41. In a hurry, he quickly wiped the ashes off his face, and the king of Israel realized that he was one of the prophets. 42. Yo, listen up! God said to him, 'Check it, dude. You messed up big time by letting that guy escape who I totally wanted destroyed. So now, your life is gonna be payback for his life, and your people will suffer the consequences too.' 43. So the king of Israel went back home feeling bummed and annoyed, and he arrived in Samaria. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 201. And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and {there were} thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots: and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it. 2. And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad, 3. Thy silver and thy gold {is} mine; thy wives also and thy children, {even} the goodliest, {are} mine. 4. And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy saying, I {am} thine, and all that I have. 5. And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 6. Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, {that} whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put {it} in their hand, and take {it} away. {pleasant: Heb. desirable} 7. Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this {man} seeketh mischief: for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not. {I denied...: Heb. I kept not back from him} 8. And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not {unto him}, nor consent. 9. Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word again. 10. And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me. {follow...: Heb. are at my feet} 11. And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell {him}, Let not him that girdeth on {his harness} boast himself as he that putteth it off. 12. And it came to pass, when {Benhadad} heard this message, as he {was} drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set {yourselves in array}. And they set {themselves in array} against the city. {message: Heb. word} {pavilions: or, tents} {Set yourselves...: or, Place the engines. And they placed the engines} 13. And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I {am} the LORD. {came: Heb. approached} 14. And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, {Even} by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou. {young...: or, servants} {order: Heb. bind, or, tie} 15. Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, {even} all the children of Israel, {being} seven thousand. 16. And they went out at noon. But Benhadad {was} drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him. 17. And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria. 18. And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive. 19. So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army which followed them. 20. And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen. 21. And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter. 22. And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee. 23. And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods {are} gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. 24. And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and put captains in their rooms: 25. And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, {and} surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so. {that thou...: Heb. that was fallen} 26. And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. {to fight...: Heb. to the war with Israel} 27. And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country. {were all...: or, were nourished} 28. And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD {is} God of the hills, but he {is} not God of the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know that I {am} the LORD. 29. And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And {so} it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day. 30. But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and {there} a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men {that were} left. And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber. {into an...: or, from chamber to chamber: Heb. into a chamber within a chamber} 31. And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel {are} merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life. 32. So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and {put} ropes on their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, {Is} he yet alive? he {is} my brother. 33. Now the men did diligently observe whether {any thing would come} from him, and did hastily catch {it}: and they said, Thy brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into the chariot. 34. And {Benhadad} said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then {said Ahab}, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away. {streets: or, market places} 35. And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite him. 36. Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him. 37. Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded {him}. {so that...: Heb. smiting and wounding} 38. So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face. 39. And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver. {pay: Heb. weigh} 40. And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said unto him, So {shall} thy judgment {be}; thyself hast decided {it}. {he was...: Heb. he was not} 41. And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of Israel discerned him that he {was} of the prophets. 42. And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out of {thy} hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people. 43. And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came to Samaria. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 211. So, like, there was this dude named Naboth, he was a Jezreelite and he had this sick vineyard in Jezreel, right next to the palace where Ahab, the king of Samaria, chilled. 2. So, Ahab goes up to Naboth and is like, 'Yo, can you give me your vineyard? I want to turn it into an herb garden because it's right next to my crib. And I'll hook you up with an even better vineyard in exchange, or if you'd rather, I'll give you the cash value for it. 3. And Naboth was like, 'Ahab, dude, I can't let that happen! It's totally against what God wants for me to just give away my family's property to you.' 4. So, Ahab went back to his crib all moody and upset because of what Naboth the Jezreelite said to him. Naboth straight up told him, 'No way am I giving you my family's inheritance.' Ahab was so pissed, he just threw himself on his bed, turned away, and refused to eat anything. 5. Then Jezebel, his wife, came up to him and was like, 'Yo, why you lookin' all down? Not even eating any bread?' 6. So, like, I talked to this girl and I was all like, 'Hey, Naboth from Jezreel, give me your vineyard and I'll pay you for it. Or, if you prefer, I can give you another vineyard in exchange.' But then he was all like, 'No way, man! I'm not giving you my vineyard!' 7. Yo, Jezebel, his wifey, straight up said to him, 'You really gonna be in charge of Israel now? Come on, get up and have some grub, enjoy yourself. I'll hook you up with Naboth the Jezreelite's vineyard.' 8. So she slid into Ahab's DMs, using his custom emoji seal, and sent the messages to the OGs and influencers in his city, who were homies with Naboth. 9. So she sent messages that said, 'Everyone, we're having a fast, and let's make Naboth the center of attention among the people. Like, he should be like, super popular and stuff.' 10. And get two dudes, total non-believers, to stand in front of him and talk trash about him, claiming he disrespected God and the ruler. And then, take him outside and throw rocks at him until he dies. 11. So, like, the dudes from his town, ya know, the older guys and the fancy peeps who lived there, did what Jezebel told them to do. They followed everything that was written in the letters she sent them. 12. They called for a fast and put Naboth in a top position among the people. 13. So, like, there were these two guys who were like total troublemakers, and they came and sat in front of this other guy. And these troublemaker guys started talking smack about this guy named Naboth, in front of everyone! They were saying how Naboth disrespected God and the king. And guess what they did next? They actually took Naboth out of the city and threw stones at him until he died. Like, it was brutal, man. 14. So they texted Jezebel like, 'Naboth got wrecked and he's gone.' 15. So, like, Jezebel found out that Naboth got stoned and, you know, dropped dead. And then Jezebel goes to Ahab and is all like, 'Dude, get up and take over Naboth's vineyard in Jezreel! He totally wouldn't sell it to you even if you offered cash, but guess what? Naboth ain't around anymore, he's dead!' 16. So like, Ahab found out that Naboth was dead, and he was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna head to Naboth's vineyard in Jezreel and take it for myself.' 17. So, like, God reached out to Elijah the Tishbite, right? And here's what He said, 18. Hey, get up and head over to meet Ahab, the king of Israel. He's chilling in Samaria, specifically at Naboth's vineyard, where he's planning to take it over. 19. And you need to talk to him, like, listen up, the LORD says, did you really have to go and kill someone just to take their stuff? And I'm telling you, the LORD says, just like how those dogs licked up Naboth's blood in that place, they're gonna lick up your blood too, yes, yours. 20. Ahab was like, 'Yo, Elijah, you found me, you sneaky enemy!' And Elijah was like, 'Yeah, I found you, bro. You sold yourself out, doing evil stuff that's not cool in the eyes of the LORD.' 21. Yo, listen up. Imma make some bad stuff happen to you, like seriously not cool. Your fam? Yeah, they're gone. And I'm gonna wipe out all dudes in Ahab's gang, whether they pee standing or are left behind in Israel. It's gonna be rough, man. 22. And your crib will be like Jeroboam's crib and Baasha's crib, 'cause you totally ticked me off and got Israel to sin. 23. The LORD also said some stuff about Jezebel, like, 'The dogs are gonna chow down on her by the wall of Jezreel.' (By wall, I mean ditch, FYI.) 24. Anyone who dies in the city, Ahab's got the dogs to feast on 'em; and anyone who dies in the field, the birds in the sky got a meal lined up for 'em. 25. But no one was as wicked as Ahab, who completely sold himself out to do evil in the eyes of the LORD. His wife Jezebel was his partner in crime, always encouraging him to do wrong. 26. And OMG, he was like totally doing the most disgusting thing ever by worshipping idols, just like how the Amorites used to do, but then God kicked them out before the Israelites. 27. And like, Ahab heard what was said, and he totally freaked out and tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and walked around all gentle and stuff. 28. So, like, God spoke to Elijah the Tishbite, and this happened... 29. Yo, peep how Ahab is straight up humble in front of me? 'Cause he's all humble and respectful, I won't let any bad stuff happen to him while he's alive. But, his descendants gonna catch that bad energy later on in life, like, it's gonna hit his fam hard. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 211. And it came to pass after these things, {that} Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which {was} in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. 2. And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it {is} near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; {or}, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money. {seem...: Heb. be good in thine eyes} 3. And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee. 4. And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread. 5. But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread? 6. And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee {another} vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard. 7. And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, {and} eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. 8. So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed {them} with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that {were} in his city, dwelling with Naboth. 9. And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people: {on high...: Heb. in the top of the people} 10. And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And {then} carry him out, and stone him, that he may die. 11. And the men of his city, {even} the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, {and} as it {was} written in the letters which she had sent unto them. 12. They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. 13. And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, {even} against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died. 14. Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead. 15. And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead. 16. And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it. 17. And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 18. Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which {is} in Samaria: behold, {he is} in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down to possess it. 19. And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine. 20. And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he answered, I have found {thee}: because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the LORD. 21. Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, 22. And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked {me} to anger, and made Israel to sin. 23. And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel. {wall: or, ditch} 24. Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat. 25. But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. {stirred...: or, incited} 26. And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all {things} as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 27. And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly. 28. And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 29. Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: {but} in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Kings 221. And they went on for like three whole years without any drama or fighting between Syria and Israel. 2. So, like, after three years, it happened that Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, rolled up to meet the king of Israel. 3. Yo, listen up, fam! The king of Israel straight up told his squad, 'Y'all know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, right? And we just sitting here, not even snatching it from the king of Syria's grip? Like, bro, we keeping it low-key, not making any moves.' 4. And he was like, yo Jehoshaphat, you wanna tag along to Ramothgilead for a battle? And Jehoshaphat was like, word to the king of Israel, I got you fam. My people are your people, my horses are your horses. 5. Yo, Jehoshaphat was like, yo king of Israel, can you do me a solid and ask the LORD for some guidance today? 6. So the king of Israel got all the prophets, like around 400 peeps, and asked them, 'Should I attack Ramothgilead or chill out?' And they were like, 'Dude, go for it! The Lord's got your back.' 7. Jehoshaphat was like, 'Yo, isn't there any other prophet from the LORD around here that we can hit up and ask? 8. And the king of Israel was like, 'Hey, Jehoshaphat, there's this one dude, Micaiah, son of Imlah, he's the only one we can ask God for advice, but I can't stand him! He never says anything good about me, only bad stuff.' And Jehoshaphat was like, 'Don't diss him like that, dude.' 9. So the king of Israel was like, 'Yo, get Micaiah the son of Imlah over here ASAP!' The king called for his officer to make it happen. (BTW, officer could also mean eunuch if you didn't know) 10. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were kicking back on their thrones, all dressed up in their fancy robes, chilling in an open area by the entrance of the gate in Samaria. And there were a bunch of prophets going at it, spittin' fire with their prophecies right in front of them. 11. Then Zedekiah, Chenaanah's son, crafted some sick iron horns and was like, 'Yo, this is what the LORD says: Use these horns to completely wreck the Syrians until they're totally gone.' 12. And like, all the prophets were like, prophesying and stuff, like saying, yo, go up to Ramothgilead and like, don't worry 'bout a thing, 'cause the LORD's got your back and He's gonna deliver it into the king's hand. Fuuursho! 13. So the messenger who went to fetch Micaiah talked to him and said, listen up, all the prophets are totally agreeing and saying good things to please the king. Can you just say something that sounds positive and agree with them? 14. And Micaiah was like, I swear on everything holy, I'm only gonna say what the LORD tells me to say, no cap. 15. So he went up to the king. And the king was like, 'Yo, Micaiah, should we hit up Ramothgilead and start a battle or should we just chill? And Micaiah was all like, 'Go for it, man! The LORD's got your back, he'll totally hand it over to you.' 16. The king was like, 'Seriously, dude, how many times do I have to tell you to only speak the truth in the name of the LORD?' 17. So, like, I was looking at all of Israel and they were like, totally scattered on the hills, you know, like sheep without a shepherd. And then the LORD was like, 'Yo, these peeps don't have anyone to lead them, so let them go home in peace.' 18. The king of Israel straight up told Jehoshaphat, like, 'Didn't I tell you that this dude would never say anything positive about me? Only negative vibes, man!' 19. Yo, listen up and pay attention to what the LORD said: I peeped the LORD chillin' on his throne, and all the heavenly squad posted up on his right and left. 20. God was like, 'How can we convince Ahab to go to Ramothgilead and get himself killed?' And one person had this idea, while another person had a different idea. (The word 'persuade' could also mean deceive.) 21. Then this spirit appeared before God and said, 'I got this, I'll convince him'. 22. And God was like, 'How are you gonna do it?' And the lying spirit was like, 'I'm gonna go and make all his prophets tell lies.' And God was like, 'Yeah, go ahead, convince him and succeed. Go and do it.' 23. So listen up, the LORD has made these prophets straight up spew lies and spread evil things about you. 24. So this guy Zedekiah, Chenaanah's son, came up and straight-up slapped Micaiah across the face. Then he had the audacity to ask, 'Yo, how did the Spirit of the LORD even get to you to speak? Like, it should've come to me first, right?' 25. And Micaiah was like, yo, check it: when the time comes and you in a tight spot, look for a safe hideout, like a secret room within a room. Rock on. 26. So the king of Israel was like, 'Yo, get Micaiah and take him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and also to Joash, the king's son.' 27. And like, the king was all like, 'Yo, put this {dude} in the slammer and give him some super plain bread and water until I come back, no drama, bro.' 28. And Micaiah was like, if you come back safe and sound, then the LORD definitely did not speak through me. And he was like, listen up, everyone! 29. So, like, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to this place called Ramothgilead. 30. So, like, the king of Israel was all like, 'Yo, Jehoshaphat, I'm gonna low-key change my appearance and join the battle, but you should totally keep wearing your fancy clothes.' And then the king of Israel totally disguised himself and got in the middle of the battle. It's kind of like he was like, 'I'll just slip in unnoticed, no biggie.' 31. So, the king of Syria gathered his squad of 32 chariot commanders and ordered them: 'Don't waste your time battling against anyone but the king of Israel, whether they're big shots or nobodies'. 32. So, like, when the chariot captains spotted Jehoshaphat, they were like, dude, that has to be the king of Israel! And they totally changed course to fight against him. Then Jehoshaphat straight up yelled out for help. 33. So, like, when those chariot leaders realized it wasn't the Israelite king, they decided to stop chasing him. 34. So there was this dude who randomly shot an arrow and ended up hitting the king of Israel in a weak spot in his armor. The king was like, 'Driver, get me out of here! I've been wounded!' 35. The fight was on fire that day: and the king was chilling in his swag chariot, taking on the Syrians. But when it hit evening, he went out like a boss and there was mad blood flowing from his wound into the middle of the chariot. 36. A message spread like wildfire among the gang as the sun was setting, declaring, 'Everyone, head back to your turf, and each person return to their own hood!' 37. So the king passed away, and they took him to Samaria where they laid him to rest; he was buried in Samaria. {was brought: Hebrew term came} 38. So this person washed the chariot in the Samaria pool, and, like, the dogs totally licked up his blood. They also washed his armor, just like the LORD said they would. Pretty intense, right? 39. Yo, you wanna know more about Ahab and all the stuff he did? Check out the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. They've got all the deets on Ahab's acts, the sick ivory house he built, and all the lit cities he constructed. 40. So Ahab passed away, and his son Ahaziah took over as king. 41. So, Jehoshaphat, Asa's son, started ruling over Judah during Ahab's fourth year as the king of Israel. 42. Jehoshaphat took the throne at the young age of thirty-five and ruled Jerusalem for a solid twenty-five years. His mom, Azubah, was the daughter of Shilhi. 43. And like, he totally followed in the footsteps of his dad Asa, like not deviating at all, doing things that were right in the eyes of the LORD. 44. But like, those high places were still there, ya know? People kept offering sacrifices and burning incense up there. 45. So, basically, Jehoshaphat was like, 'Yo, let's squash the beef with the king of Israel.' 46. So, like, there's more stuff that Jehoshaphat did, all the powerful things he did and all the battles he fought. You can find all the deets about it in the book that's keeping track of all the cool stuff the kings of Judah did, you know? 47. He got rid of the leftover sodomites in the land that were still around from his father Asa's time. 48. So basically, at that time, Edom didn't have a king. They had a sort of second-in-command king, you know? 49. Jehoshaphat wanted to flex his ship game with some boss Tharshish ships to score mad gold from Ophir. But oh snap, those ships straight up FAILED because they got wrecked at Eziongeber. And we ain't talking ten ships, we talking ten losses. 50. So Ahaziah, Ahab's son, asked Jehoshaphat, 'Can my peeps roll with your squad on the ships?' But Jehoshaphat was like, 'Nah, not feeling it.' 51. And Jehoshaphat passed away peacefully, joining his ancestors, and was laid to rest in the city of David, his father. Jehoram, his son, took over as the new ruler. 52. So, like, this dude Ahaziah, Ahab's son, started ruling over Israel in Samaria while Jehoshaphat was king of Judah, around the seventeenth year. He stayed in power for two years, ruling over Israel. 53. So, like, this dude totally messed up in God's eyes. He was just following in his parents' footsteps, and even took after Jeroboam, the dude who led Israel astray. Smh, not a good look. 54. Yo, this dude was into Baal, like legit served and worshipped him. And, dang, he really ticked off the LORD God of Israel, you know, like super annoyed Him, just like his dad did. No chill. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Kings 221. And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. 2. And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. 3. And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead {is} ours, and we {be} still, {and} take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria? {still...: Heb. silent from taking it} 4. And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I {am} as thou {art}, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. 5. And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day. 6. Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver {it} into the hand of the king. 7. And Jehoshaphat said, {Is there} not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him? 8. And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, {There is} yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. 9. Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten {hither} Micaiah the son of Imlah. {officer: or, eunuch} 10. And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. {void...: Heb. floor} 11. And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have consumed them. 12. And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver {it} into the king's hand. 13. And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets {declare} good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak {that which is} good. 14. And Micaiah said, {As} the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto me, that will I speak. 15. So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver {it} into the hand of the king. 16. And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but {that which is} true in the name of the LORD? 17. And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace. 18. And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? 19. And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left. 20. And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner. {persuade: or, deceive} 21. And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him. 22. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persuade {him}, and prevail also: go forth, and do so. 23. Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee. 24. But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee? 25. And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. {into...: or, from chamber to chamber: Heb. a chamber in a chamber} 26. And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 27. And say, Thus saith the king, Put this {fellow} in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I come in peace. 28. And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you. 29. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead. 30. And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle. {I will...: or, when he was to disguise himself, and enter into the battle} 31. But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel. 32. And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it {is} the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out. 33. And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it {was} not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him. 34. And a {certain} man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. {at a...: Heb. in his simplicity} {joints...: Heb. joints and the breastplate} {wounded: Heb. made sick} 35. And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot. {increased: Heb. ascended} {midst: Heb. bosom} 36. And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country. 37. So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king in Samaria. {was brought: Heb. came} 38. And {one} washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word of the LORD which he spake. 39. Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 40. So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. 41. And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. 42. Jehoshaphat {was} thirty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 43. And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing {that which was} right in the eyes of the LORD: 44. Nevertheless the high places were not taken away; {for} the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places. 45. And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 46. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 47. And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land. 48. {There was} then no king in Edom: a deputy {was} king. 49. Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber. {made...: or, had ten ships} 50. Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not. 51. And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. 52. Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel. 53. And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: 54. For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 11. So Moab straight up went against Israel once Ahab was out of the picture. 2. So Ahaziah was hanging out in his chill chamber in Samaria when he fell through a lattice and got sick, bummer. He was like, 'Yo messengers, go ask Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, if I'm gonna bounce back from this sickness'. 3. But this super chill angel dude was like, 'Yo, Elijah the Tishbite, get up and meet the squad sent by the king of Samaria. Tell them straight up, don't you realize there's a legit God in Israel? Why are you even bothering to ask Baalzebub, the god of Ekron?' 4. So, like, God was like, 'Yo, listen up! You can't get off that bed you went on, or else you're gonna die. Bye, Elijah! 5. And when the messengers came back to him, he asked them, why did y'all go and come back? 6. So, they told him this story: Some dude came up to us and said, 'Yo, go back to the king who sent you and deliver this message to him. The LORD asks, 'Why are you seeking guidance from Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, when you know there's a God in Israel?' So basically, the LORD is saying you won't be leaving that bed you climbed onto. You're gonna die for sure, man. 7. And he's like, yo, dudes, who was that guy who came up to you and told you this stuff? What did he look like and all? Like, what's the deal with him? 8. And they were like, yo, he had a serious mane, and had this wicked leather belt around his waist. And this dude was like, 'Yo, that's Elijah the Tishbite!' 9. So the king sent a squad of 50 with their leader. They approached the man of God who was chilling up on a hill. The leader called out to him, saying, 'Hey, holy dude! The king wants you to come down.' 10. 'Yo, so Elijah straight up responds to the captain of fifty like, 'If I'm really a man of God, then bring on that fire from heaven and let it wreck you and your whole squad.' And guess what? That fire actually came down from heaven and totally burned them all up. 11. Then he sent another group of soldiers, about fifty of them along with their captain. The captain respectfully approached the man of God and said, 'Hey, the king wants you to come down right away.' 12. And Elijah was like, yo, if I'm really a man of God, then let fire rain down from heaven and wipe out you and your whole squad. And sure enough, boom! God's fire came down and totally roasted them all. 13. Then he sent another captain with his group of fifty. The captain approached Elijah, went down on his knees, and earnestly pleaded, saying, 'Oh, man of God, I humbly ask that you value not only my life but also the lives of these fifty servants of yours.' 14. Yo, check it out, fire straight up rained down from the sky and totally roasted those two leaders and their crews. So, like, can you please consider my life valuable now? 15. And the angel of the LORD was like, 'Yo Elijah, go down with him, don't be scared, bro.' So Elijah was like, 'Alright, bet,' and went down with him to the king. 16. And he was like, 'Yo, listen up! The LORD has something to say. So, you sent your boys to ask Baalzebub, the so-called god of Ekron, if it's because you think there's no God in Israel who can answer your questions? Well, I got news for you, bro. Since you did that, you ain't getting off that bed you climbed onto, and you're gonna die for sure.' 17. And just as the LORD had said through Elijah, he passed away. Then Jehoram took over as king in the second year of Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, since he didn't have any sons. 18. Yo, all the other stuff Ahaziah did, isn't it all written down in that book about the Kings of Israel? \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 11. Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab. 2. And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that {was} in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease. 3. But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, {Is it} not because {there is} not a God in Israel, {that} ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? 4. Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed. {Thou shalt...: Heb. The bed whither thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from it} 5. And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back? 6. And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, {Is it} not because {there is} not a God in Israel, {that} thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. 7. And he said unto them, What manner of man {was he} which came up to meet you, and told you these words? {What...: Heb. What was the manner of the man} 8. And they answered him, {He was} an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It {is} Elijah the Tishbite. 9. Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down. 10. And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I {be} a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. 11. Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly. 12. And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I {be} a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty. 13. And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. {fell: Heb. bowed} 14. Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight. 15. And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king. 16. And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, {is it} not because {there is} no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. 17. So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son. 18. Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 21. So, get this, when God was ready to bring Elijah up to heaven in a crazy whirlwind, Elijah rolled with Elisha from Gilgal. 2. And Elijah was like, yo Elisha, just chill here for a sec because the big man upstairs sent me to Bethel. And Elisha was like, swear on the Lord and swear on your own life, I'm not ditching you. So they both rolled down to Bethel. 3. So, like, these guys who were training to be prophets at Bethel came up to Elisha and said, 'Yo dude, do you know that the LORD is gonna snatch your teacher away from you today?' And Elisha was like, 'Yeah man, I'm aware, so just chill and keep quiet about it, okay?' 4. And Elijah was like, 'Yo Elisha, chill here for a sec, 'cause the LORD sent me to Jericho.' And Elisha was like, 'Swear, man! I ain't ditching you, not even if my life depended on it!' So they rolled up to Jericho together. 5. So, like, the prophets' guys in Jericho went up to Elisha and were all, 'Hey, do you know that the LORD is gonna take your boss away from you today?' And Elisha was like, 'Yeah, I'm totally aware of that, so just chill and keep quiet, okay?'} 6. And Elijah was like, 'Yo, dude, chill here for a bit, 'cause the LORD hooked me up to go to the Jordan river.' And the other guy was like, 'OMG, swear on the LORD and your life, I'm not gonna leave you!' So they both kept going together, no doubt. 7. Fifty dudes from the sons of the prophets went over there and took a chill spot to scope things out from a distance, while these two just kicked it by the Jordan river. 8. Then Elijah grabbed his cloak and wrapped it up. He hit the water and bam, it split in two, opening up a path for them to walk on dry land. 9. So, when they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, 'Yo, ask me what I can do for you before I bounce. And Elisha was like, 'Bro, please hook me up with a double dose of your spirit.' 10. And he was like, 'Bro, you're asking for something really difficult. But, if you actually witness me disappearing right in front of you, then okay, you can have it. But if you don't see it happen, then sorry, it's not gonna go down like that. Just saying, you asked for something pretty tough.' 11. While they were walking and chatting, suddenly this epic scene unfolded: a lit chariot with fire vibes and fiery horses rolled in and split the two apart; Elijah straight up ascended to heaven, riding on a whirlwind. It was insane! 12. Then Elisha saw it and exclaimed, 'OMG, dad, dad, you were like the ultimate ride of Israel with your sick chariot and horsemen. And just like that, you were gone. Elisha couldn't handle it, so he pulled a serious fashion move, tearing his clothes into two pieces. 13. Then he picked up Elijah's cool jacket that fell off him, and went back and stood by the riverside, you know, by the Jordan River. Just saying, 'bank' in Hebrew is 'lip', 14. So he grabbed Elijah's jacket that had fallen from him, and hit the water, saying, 'Where's the LORD God of Elijah?' And when he hit the water too, it split apart, making a path for Elisha to cross. 15. And when the dudes who followed the prophets and were hanging out in Jericho caught sight of Elisha, they were like, 'Yo, Elijah's spirit is totally on him!' So they went up to him, paid mad respect, and bowed down before him. 16. Yo, listen up! So, like, check it: we got around fifty tough dudes here, right? How 'bout we send 'em vibes to go find your master, just in case the Spirit of the LORD, like, whisked him away to some mountain or valley or sumthin'. But the dude was like, nah, don't even bother sending 'em. 17. And when they kept bugging him until he couldn't take it anymore, he was like, 'Fine, whatever.' So they sent fifty dudes to look for three whole days, but they couldn't find him anywhere. 18. So, when they came back to him, (because he was chilling in Jericho,) he straight up told them, 'Didn't I already tell y'all not to go?' 19. So the guys in the city were like, yo Elisha, check out this city, it looks pretty cool, right? But dude, our water is totally messed up, and the ground here can't grow anything. It sucks, man. 20. Then he was like, yo, get me a fresh container and put salt in it. And they brought it to him. 21. So he went to this sick water source, and just Yeeted some salt in there, and was like, 'Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs said I've healed this water, so no more death or boring dryness in this place.' 22. So like, the water totally got healed and it's been that way till today, just like what Elisha said would happen. 23. So, he left that place and went up to Bethel. And as he was walking along, a group of kids came out of the city and started making fun of him, saying, 'Hey, Mr. Baldie, go up! Hey, Mr. Baldie, go up!' 24. Then he turned around and saw them, and he got really angry and called down some serious bad vibes in the name of the LORD. And out of nowhere, two angry she-bears came charging out of the woods and totally wrecked forty-two of those kids. 25. Then he went to Mount Carmel, and after that, he headed back to Samaria. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 21. And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. 2. And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said {unto him, As} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel. 3. And the sons of the prophets that {were} at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know {it}; hold ye your peace. 4. And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho. 5. And the sons of the prophets that {were} at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know {it}; hold ye your peace. 6. And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on. 7. And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. {to view: Heb. in sight, or, over against} 8. And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped {it} together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. 9. And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me. 10. And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: {nevertheless}, if thou see me {when I am} taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be {so}. {Thou hast...: Heb. Thou hast done hard in asking} 11. And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, {there appeared} a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. 12. And Elisha saw {it}, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. 13. He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; {bank: Heb. lip} 14. And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where {is} the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went over. 15. And when the sons of the prophets which {were} to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him. 16. And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send. {strong...: Heb. sons of strength} {some mountain: Heb. one of the mountains} 17. And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. 18. And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not? 19. And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city {is} pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water {is} naught, and the ground barren. {barren: Heb. causing to miscarry} 20. And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought {it} to him. 21. And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or barren {land}. 22. So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spake. 23. And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head. 24. And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them. 25. And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 31. So, like, Jehoram, Ahab's kid, became the ruler of Israel in Samaria, when Jehoshaphat had been ruling Judah for eighteen years, and he was in power for twelve years. 2. And he did bad stuff that made God unhappy; but it wasn't as bad as what his dad and mom did. He got rid of that idol thingy that his dad made called Baal. (BTW, Baal was like a statue or something) 3. But he still kept doing the same messed up stuff as Jeroboam, which got Israel all caught up in sin - he didn't stop doing it. 4. Yo, Mesha, the king of Moab, was totally a boss when it came to raising sheep. He straight up gave the king of Israel a whopping 100,000 lambs and 100,000 rams, plus all that wool. Respect! 5. So, like, once Ahab was gone, the king of Moab totally went against the king of Israel. Can you believe it? 6. So King Jehoram left Samaria at that time and counted all of Israel. 7. So he texted Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, and was like, 'Dude, the king of Moab totally turned against me. Wanna team up and take Moab down in a battle?' And Jehoshaphat was all, 'I'm in! We're like BFFs, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses.' 8. So he's like, 'Yo, which direction should we head?' And the other dude's like, 'Bro, the path goes through the Edom desert.' 9. So the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom teamed up and took a detour that lasted a whole week. But hey, guess what? They ran out of water for both the army and the animals. It was a major problem. 10. OMG, the king of Israel was like, so devastated! He couldn't believe that the LORD brought these three kings together just to let Moab defeat them! Like, what a bummer! 11. But Jehoshaphat was like, yo, is there a prophet of the LORD up in here? We need to find out what the LORD has to say. Then one of the king of Israel's servants was like, oh yeah, we got Elisha, son of Shaphat. He used to chill with Elijah and pour water on his hands and stuff. 12. Jehoshaphat was like, yo, this dude got that divine knowledge on lock. So the kings of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom rolled up to him. 13. So Elisha was like, 'Yo, why are you even talking to me? Go consult your parents' prophets.' Then the king of Israel was like, 'No way, man. The LORD brought us three kings here to hand us over to Moab.' 14. Yo, I need to keep it real with you. Swear on the highest authority, the LORD of hosts, the one I'm serving. If it wasn't for Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, being here, I wouldn't even bother looking at you or acknowledging your presence. 15. Yo, grab me a sick musician right now. So, when this musician starts jamming, the power of the Lord vibes with him, you feel me? 16. And God was like, yo, listen up fam, I got a message for ya. Fill up this whole valley with ditches, okay? 17. So listen up, fam! God says you won't even see the wind or the rain, but guess what? That valley is gonna get filled with water, enough for you, your pets, and all your livestock to drink up. 18. And like, this is not a big deal for God, okay? He's totally gonna make sure you kick the Moabites' butts too. 19. You gotta wreck every fortified city, every cool city, and cut down every amazing tree, and block all water sources, and mess up every good piece of land with stones. (mess up: in Hebrew it means to make sad) 20. And the next morning, when they were making the food offering,  something crazy happened: water started flowing from the direction of Edom, and the whole land got flooded! 21. And when all the Moabites found out that the kings were about to attack them, they called together all those who could suit up and get ready for battle, and they positioned themselves at the border. 22. So, like, they woke up super early in the morning, and the sun was all beaming down on the water, and the Moabites, yo, they saw that the water on the other side was legit red, like blood and stuff. 23. And they were like, dude, this is blood! The kings totally went at it and killed each other. So now, Moab, let's go grab all their stuff! 24. So, when the Israelites reached the Israelite camp, they totally defeated the Moabites, causing them to run away scared. But not stopping there, they kept on attacking the Moabites in their own turf. It was an absolute smackdown! 25. So they totally wrecked the cities, on every prime spot of land each person threw their own rocks, filling it up. They blocked all the water wells and chopped down all the good trees, except in Kirharaseth they left the stones behind. But then the slingers went around and attacked it. 26. So, like, when the king of Moab realized he was totally getting wrecked in battle, he got together a squad of 700 sword-wielding soldiers, thinking they could break through and reach the king of Edom. But guess what? They couldn't. Epic fail, bro. 27. So he sacrificed his oldest son, who was supposed to be the next ruler, as a burnt offering on the wall. This seriously ticked off Israel and they ditched him, going back to their own land. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 31. Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years. 2. And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made. {image: Heb. statue} 3. Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom. 4. And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool. 5. But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 6. And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel. 7. And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I {am} as thou {art}, my people as thy people, {and} my horses as thy horses. 8. And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom. 9. So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them. {that...: Heb. at their feet} 10. And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab! 11. But Jehoshaphat said, {Is there} not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said, Here {is} Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah. 12. And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him. 13. And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab. 14. And Elisha said, {As} the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee. 15. But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him. 16. And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches. 17. For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts. 18. And this is {but} a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand. 19. And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones. {mar: Heb. grieve} 20. And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water. 21. And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border. {gathered: Heb. were cried together} {put on...: Heb. gird himself with a girdle} 22. And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side {as} red as blood: 23. And they said, This {is} blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil. {slain: Heb. destroyed} 24. And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in {their} country. {they went...: or, they smote in it even smiting} 25. And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about {it}, and smote it. {only in...: Heb. until he left its stones in Kirharaseth} 26. And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through {even} unto the king of Edom: but they could not. 27. Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him {for} a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to {their own} land. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 41. So this woman, who was married to one of the prophets' sons, came to Elisha and said, 'Yo, my husband, your boy, passed away. And you know he had mad respect for the LORD. But now, the creditor is here tryna take my two sons as slaves.' 2. Elisha was like, 'Yo, what can I do for ya? Spill the tea, what do you have in the crib?' And the woman was like, 'Sorry, but I'm totally broke. I only have this little jar of oil.' 3. And he was like, 'Yo, go out and ask your neighbors if you can borrow their empty vessels. Don't just ask for a few, borrow as many as you can, no cap.' 4. Once you're inside, close the door behind you and your squad, then flex by pouring into all those lit containers and set aside the ones that are fully stacked. 5. So she left him and closed the door with her and her sons who had brought the stuff to her, and she spilled it all out. 6. When all the containers were filled up, she said to her son, 'Yo, grab me another container.' And he was like, 'Nah, there ain't no more containers left.' And the oil stopped flowing. 7. So she went and told the prophet guy. And he was like, yo, sell the oil and use the money to pay off your debt. Then you can live with your kids on the leftover cash. #NoMoreBills 8. So, one day, Elisha went to Shunem where he met this amazing woman. She insisted that he join her for a meal. And from that day forward, whenever he passed by, he would stop by and have a bite to eat. Can you believe it? This woman was just so awesome that she had such an impact on Elisha that he couldn't resist her invitation! 9. And she was like, yo, hubby, check it out, I'm getting major vibes that this dude passing by is a legit holy man of God. 10. Hey, how about we create a chill space, like a mini room on the wall? We can put a bed, a table, a stool, and a cool candle holder there. So when he comes to visit, he can crash there. 11. So, one day, he arrives at the place, goes into the room, and crashes there. 12. Yo, tell Gehazi, your sidekick, to hit up this Shunammite chick. And when he finally got her on the line, she showed up in front of him. 13. And he was like, yo, go tell her, like wow, you've been looking out for us so much, what can we do to thank you? Do you want us to put in a good word for you with the king or the boss? And she was like, nah, I'm good, I'm chilling with my own peeps. 14. And he was like, okay, what can we do to help her out? And Gehazi was like, bro, she doesn't have any kids and her husband is, like, ancient. 15. Then he was like, 'Yo, call her.' And when he did, she came and stood by the door. 16. And he was like, yo, in about this specific time, you're gonna be hugging up on a son. And she was like, nah, my dude, you, the man of God, better not be straight up lying to your girl. 17. And the lady got pregnant and gave birth to a son just like Elisha had predicted, at the right time in her life. 18. So, like, when the kid got older, one day he went out to his dad who was working with the reapers. 19. And he's like, yo pops, my head hurts so bad. And he's like, dude, go tell that kid to take you to your mom. 20. And after he was taken and brought to his mother, he sat on her lap until noon, and then passed away. 21. And she went up and put him on the man of God's bed and closed the door on him, then bounced outta there. 22. So she texts her husband and asks him to hook her up with one of the epic boys and one of the cool rides, so she can zoom to the man of God and come back. 23. And he was like, why are you even going to him today? It's not the new moon or sabbath or anything. And she was all like, it's gonna be fine, no worries. 24. So she got a ride ready and told her servant to hurry up and go, without holding back, unless she says otherwise. 25. So she went and found the man of God at mount Carmel. And when the man of God saw her from a distance, he said to his servant Gehazi, 'Look, there goes that Shunammite woman.' 26. Yo, go quickly and meet her, then ask her how she's doin'. Are things going good for you? Is your husband doing alright? Is the kid alright? And she replied, 'Everything's all good.' 27. So, she went up to the man of God on the hill and grabbed onto his feet, but Gehazi tried to push her away. But the man of God said, 'Leave her alone, her spirit is troubled deep down, and the LORD has kept it a secret from me, and hasn't told me yet.' 28. And she was like, wait, did I ask for a kid from you? I straight up told you not to play games with me! 29. Yo, Gehazi, get ready and grab my staff. Go on your way—don't greet anyone you meet, and if someone greets you, don't respond. Just put my staff on the kid's face. 30. And the kid's mom was like, 'OMG, I swear to God and swear on my life, I'm not gonna abandon you.' So, the child got up and started following her. 31. Gehazi went ahead of them and gently placed the staff on the child's face, but nothing happened. So he went back to meet Elisha and said, 'Sorry, but the child didn't wake up.' 32. So, when Elisha entered the house, guess what? The child was dead, just lying there on the bed. 33. So, he went inside and closed the door behind him, leaving just the two of them. Then, he started praying to the LORD. 34. And he climbed up onto the bed, and leaned over the kid, and pressed his lips against its lips, and his eyes against its eyes, and his hands against its hands: and he stretched himself out over the kid; and the body of the kid felt warm. 35. Then he went back inside and started pacing back and forth, and went up to the child and stretched himself out on him. And the kid sneezed seven times, and finally opened his eyes. {to and fro: Hebrew meaning moving back and forth} 36. And he was like, yo Gehazi, hit up that Shunammite girl. So he hit her up and when she came to him, he was like, take your kid with you. 37. So she walked in, and went straight to him, and like totally prostrated herself on the floor, and like picked up her son, and then left. 38. So Elisha went back to Gilgal, and there was a major shortage of food in the land. The guys who were training to become prophets were hanging out with him, and he told his assistant, 'Get the big pot and cook some soup for the guys.' 39. And someone went to the field to collect herbs, and they found a super random vine with a bunch of these wild squash things. They grabbed a ton and then chopped them up and tossed them into the pot of soup because they had no clue what they were. 40. So they served the food for the guys to eat. And while they were munching on the soup, they freaked out and said, 'Yo, man of God, this is some deadly stuff in the pot!' And they couldn't eat it for real. 41. But he was like, yo, bring me some meal. So he threw it in the pot and was like, serve it up to the homies so they can eat. And guess what? The pot was all good, no bad vibes or anything. 42. So there was this dude from Baalshalisha who brought the man of God some fresh vibes - twenty loaves of barley bread and fully loaded corn on the cob. And he was like, 'Yo, feed the people with this!' {the husk...: or, his scrip, or, garment} 43. And his servant was like, um, are you serious? Are you expecting me to serve this to a hundred people? But he was like, yup, give it to them anyways. Cuz God said, they're gonna eat and still have leftovers, so we good. 44. Then he put it in front of them, and they chowed down and had leftovers, just like the LORD said. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 41. Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. 2. And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. 3. Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, {even} empty vessels; borrow not a few. {borrow not...: or, scant not} 4. And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full. 5. So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought {the vessels} to her; and she poured out. 6. And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, {There is} not a vessel more. And the oil stayed. 7. Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest. {debt: or, creditor} 8. And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where {was} a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And {so} it was, {that} as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. {it fell on a day: Heb. there was a day} {constrained him: Heb. laid hold on him} 9. And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this {is} an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually. 10. Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither. 11. And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there. 12. And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him. 13. And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what {is} to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people. 14. And he said, What then {is} to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old. 15. And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door. 16. And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, {thou} man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid. {season: Heb. set time} 17. And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life. 18. And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers. 19. And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother. 20. And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and {then} died. 21. And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut {the door} upon him, and went out. 22. And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again. 23. And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? {it is} neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, {It shall be} well. {well: Heb. peace} 24. Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not {thy} riding for me, except I bid thee. {slack...: Heb. restrain not for me to ride} 25. So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, {yonder is} that Shunammite: 26. Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, {Is it} well with thee? {is it} well with thy husband? {is it} well with the child? And she answered, {It is} well. 27. And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul {is} vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid {it} from me, and hath not told me. {him...: Heb. by his feet} {vexed: Heb. bitter} 28. Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me? 29. Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. 30. And the mother of the child said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her. 31. And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but {there was} neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked. {hearing: Heb. attention} 32. And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, {and} laid upon his bed. 33. He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD. 34. And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. 35. Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. {to and fro: Heb. once hither and once thither} 36. And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son. 37. Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out. 38. And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and {there was} a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets {were} sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets. 39. And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred {them} into the pot of pottage: for they knew {them} not. 40. So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O {thou} man of God, {there is} death in the pot. And they could not eat {thereof}. 41. But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast {it} into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot. {harm: Heb. evil thing} 42. And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat. {the husk...: or, his scrip, or, garment} 43. And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave {thereof}. 44. So he set {it} before them, and they did eat, and left {thereof}, according to the word of the LORD. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 51. Yo, Naaman, the big shot captain of the king of Syria's crew, was straight up impressive and respected 'cause the Lord had helped him make Syria win battles and stuff. He was also pretty darn brave, but here's the thing, he had a case of leprosy. Like, it wasn't a good look, ya know? 2. So, like, the Syrians went out in groups and, like, kidnapped this girl from Israel and she became, like, a servant for Naaman's wife. 3. And she was like, yo, imagine if my boss had the hookup with that prophet in Samaria! He could totally cure him of his leprosy and stuff. Like, for real! 4. So this person went in and told their boss, like, yo, check it, this girl from Israel said something like this and that. 5. So, like, the King of Syria was like, 'Yo, listen up, I'm gonna send a letter to the King of Israel.' So he bounced and took with him ten talents of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten outfits. Oh, and just so you know, 'with...in his hand' means he took it all with him. 6. So, this message was taken to the king of Israel, like 'yo, when you get this letter, check it, I'm sending Naaman, my servant, to you. He needs help with his leprosy, bro. 7. So, like, the king of Israel gets this letter, right? And he's, like, totally shook! He tears his clothes and goes, 'Dude, am I, like, God or something? Can I just kill and bring people back to life? This guy wants me to cure his leprosy or whatever. Can you believe he's tryna pick a fight with me? Seriously, think about it, guys! It's so not cool.' 8. So, like, when Elisha, this legit dude who's close to God, found out that the king of Israel tore his clothes in distress, he sent a message to the king, being all like, 'Why'd you tear your clothes, man? Come see me, and you'll realize there's a true prophet here in Israel.' 9. So Naaman rolls up with his dope horses and sick chariot, and parks at the entrance of Elisha's crib, straight flexin'. 10. So Elisha hit him up with a DM, like, 'Yo, go and take a dip in the Jordan River seven times, and you'll be all good - your skin will be back and you'll be squeaky clean fam'. 11. But Naaman was mad and left, saying, 'Dude, I totally thought this guy was gonna come out, like, flex and shout to his God, and do some kind of cool magic hand wave thing, and BAM, no more leprosy.' 12. Like, seriously? Are Abana and Pharpar, those rivers in Damascus, supposed to be better than all the waters in Israel? Can't I just wash myself there and be clean? And then, in a fit of anger, he just stormed off. You know, Abana, or whatever it's called. 13. And his homies approached him and were like, yo pops, if the prophet told you to do something major, wouldn't you do it? So why not just listen to him when he says, 'Yo, cleanse yourself and be fresh'? 14. So he went down and took a dip in the Jordan River, just like the man of God told him to. And guess what? His skin became all fresh and smooth, like that of a newborn baby. He was totally clean! 15. Then he went back to the man of God with all his crew, stood before him, and said, 'Look, I get it now. The only true God is in Israel. So, please, accept this gift from your humble servant.' 16. He's like, bro, I swear on the Lord's name, the one I stand before, I ain't taking anything. He kept pushing him to take it, but he was like, nah, I'm good. 17. And Naaman was like, yo, can I like, get a couple of loads of dirt? Cuz I'm totally done with offering burnt sacrifices to other gods. From now on, I'm all about worshipping the LORD. 18. Yo, God, forgive me for this one. So, when my boss goes to worship this god named Rimmon and leans on me for support, and I gotta bow down with him in Rimmon's house, I hope you'll pardon me for doing it too. 19. And he was like, 'Yo, take it easy bro.' So he bounced out of there, just a few steps away. {a little...: It was just a small distance} 20. But Gehazi, Elisha's servant, straight up said, yo, check it, my master totally let Naaman off the hook, the Syrian dude, by not accepting the stuff he brought. But, I swear on the Lord's name, I'm gonna chase after him and grab something from him. 21. Gehazi decided to chase after Naaman. When Naaman noticed him running towards him, he hopped off his chariot to greet him and asked, 'Yo, what's up? Everything cool?' 22. And he was like, 'Everything's good, dude.' My boss sent me a message and he was like, 'Yo, check it out, two young dudes from mount Ephraim, they're like sons of the prophets or something, just arrived. Can you hook them up with like a ton of cash and a couple of fresh outfits?' 23. Naaman was like, 'Yo, be cool, bro, take these two talents.' And he kept insisting, so he put two bags filled with silver, along with two sets of clothes, on two of his servants. They carried it all in front of him. 24. And when he reached the tower, he grabbed {them} from their hand, and placed {them} in the house. Then he set the dudes free, and they left. {tower: or, secret place} 25. So he went in and stood in front of his master. And Elisha asked him, 'Where you been at, Gehazi?' And he replied, 'I haven't been anywhere, boss, nowhere at all.' 26. And he was like, dude, did my heart not go with you when that guy turned around from his ride to greet you? Is this like, the right moment to be accepting money, clothes, fancy gardens, vineyards, animals, and people to work for you and clean your stuff? 27. So Naaman's leprosy will stick to you and to your descendants forever. And Naaman left his presence completely covered in leprosy, like pure white snow. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 51. Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty man in valour, {but he was} a leper. {with: Heb. before} {honourable: or, gracious: Heb. lifted up, or, accepted in countenance} {deliverance: or, victory} 2. And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she waited on Naaman's wife. {waited...: Heb. was before} 3. And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord {were} with the prophet that {is} in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy. {with: Heb. before} {recover: Heb. gather in} 4. And {one} went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that {is} of the land of Israel. 5. And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand {pieces} of gold, and ten changes of raiment. {with...: Heb. in his hand} 6. And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have {therewith} sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy. 7. And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, {Am} I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me. 8. And it was {so}, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. 9. So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. 10. And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean. 11. But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper. {I thought: Heb. I said} {I thought...: or, I said with myself, He will surely come out, etc: Heb. I said} {strike: Heb. move up and down} 12. {Are} not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. {Abana: or, Amana} 13. And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My father, {if} the prophet had bid thee {do some} great thing, wouldest thou not have done {it}? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? 14. Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. 15. And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that {there is} no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant. 16. But he said, {As} the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none. And he urged him to take {it}; but he refused. 17. And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD. 18. In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, {that} when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing. 19. And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way. {a little...: Heb. a little piece of ground} 20. But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, {as} the LORD liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him. 21. So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw {him} running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, {Is} all well? {Is...: Heb. Is there peace?} 22. And he said, All {is} well. My master hath sent me, saying, Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. 23. And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid {them} upon two of his servants; and they bare {them} before him. 24. And when he came to the tower, he took {them} from their hand, and bestowed {them} in the house: and he let the men go, and they departed. {tower: or, secret place} 25. But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence {comest thou}, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. {no whither: Heb. not hither or thither} 26. And he said unto him, Went not mine heart {with thee}, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? {Is it} a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? 27. The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper {as white} as snow. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 61. So, the bros from the prophet gang were like, 'Yo Elisha, check it, the spot we're crashin' at with you is mad cramped, man.' 2. Yo, let's go to Jordan and grab a beam each to build ourselves a dope crib. Dude was like, 'Yeah, go for it'. 3. And someone was like, yo, chill and come kick it with us, bro. And he's like, bet, I'm down. 4. So he like went with them, no cap. And when they pull up at Jordan, they start slaying wood, you know what I'm saying? 5. So like, while this one dude was cutting down a beam, the axe head like, totally fell into the water. And he freaked out, and was like, 'Yo, master! That axe head was borrowed, dude!' 6. The guy who speaks for God asked, 'Where did it fall?' And the other guy showed him the spot. Then the guy grabbed a stick, threw it in there, and believe it or not, the metal floated. 7. So, he was like, 'Yo, pick that stuff up.' And then he reached out his hand and grabbed it. 8. So, like, the king of Syria started this war against Israel, and he gathered his crew and was like, 'Okay, let's set up camp in this specific spot.' 9. yo, the man of God hit up the king of Israel and was like, 'yo, don't even go near that spot, 'cause the Syrians rolled through there. 10. So the king of Israel slid into the DMs of the spot that the man of God mentioned and gave him a heads up. And he stayed there to keep himself out of trouble, not just once, but multiple times. 11. The king of Syria was freaking out because of this, so he gathered his squad and asked them, 'Yo, can someone tell me who among us is spying for the king of Israel?' 12. One of his servants was like, 'Nah, my dude, O king. But yo, Elisha, the prophet from Israel, straight up be telling the king of Israel all the stuff you be saying in your crib.' 13. So he's like, 'Yo, go check where he's at, so I can send for him.' And then someone was like, 'Listen up, he's chillin' in Dothan, just so you know.' 14. So he sent a whole squad of horses, chariots, and a massive crew. They arrived under the cover of night and surrounded the city completely. {heavy: meaning huge} 15. So, when the servant of the man of God woke up, went outside, they saw that the city was surrounded by a huge army with horses and chariots. The servant freaked out and said, 'Oh no, boss! What are we gonna do now?' 16. And he was like, don't even trip: we got way more people on our side than they do on theirs. 17. So Elisha was like, 'Yo, God, please open this guy's eyes so he can see what's really going on.' And guess what? God did it! The young dude's eyes were opened and bam! He could see that the whole mountain was packed with these sick horses and fire chariots, all surrounding Elisha! It was lit! 18. So, when they went up to Elisha, he talked to God and was like, 'Hey, could you please make these people blind?' And then they actually became blind, just like Elisha said. 19. And Elisha was like, 'Nah, guys, you're going in the wrong direction and this ain't even the right city. Follow me and I'll take you to the guy you're looking for.' So, he led them to Samaria. #NoWorries, just come with me. 20. So, like, when they arrived in Samaria, Elisha was all like, 'Yo, LORD, give these dudes some epic vision.' And guess what? The LORD totally hooked them up, and boom! They could see everything around them in Samaria. 21. The king of Israel asks Elisha, 'Hey, dude, should I like, totally go all out and attack them? Should I hit them or what?' 22. And he was like, yo, don't go all violent on those peeps: why would you wanna harm the ones you captured with your weapon? Just give 'em some grub and H2O, let 'em eat, drink, and bounce back to their boss. 23. And he made sure there was a ton of food and drinks for them. After they filled themselves up, he sent them back to their boss. From then on, the Syrian bands never came back to the land of Israel. 24. So like, later on, Benhadad, the king of Syria, got all his squad together and rolled up to Samaria, ready to put it on lockdown 25. Yo, there was this huge famine in Samaria, like, legit bad vibes. And yo, they had the city under siege and it got so desperate that they were selling an ass's head for, like, 80 pieces of silver, and like, a tiny bit of dove's dung for five pieces of silver. Talk about crazy times, man. 26. So, like, the king of Israel was just, you know, strolling along on this wall, when suddenly this woman starts yelling for help, you know? She's all like, 'Yo! My lord, O king, help me!' 27. And he was like, if God doesn't help you, where do you expect me to help you from? From the farming tools or from the grape crushing machine? God forbid I save you myself. 28. The king was like, yo, what's up with you? And she was like, this other chick straight up told me to give my son so we can feast on him today, and then tomorrow we eat my son. Like, what?! 29. So, like, we were super desperate, and we ended up cooking and eating my own son. Then, I was all like, 'Yo, give me your son so we can eat him too.' But she straight up hid her son and didn't give him to us. 30. So, like, when the king heard what the woman said, he totally freaked out and ripped his clothes. Then he went along the wall, and everyone was staring at him, and guess what? He was wearing sackcloth under his clothes, like, against his skin. 31. And he was like, yo, I swear on everything, if Elisha the son of Shaphat isn't toast by the end of today, may God unleash some major consequences on me. 32. But Elisha was chilling at home, vibing with the elders. Then, the king sent a dude to see him, but before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, 'Yo, peep how this killer's offspring is tryna snatch my head? When the messenger comes, lock the door and keep him outside. Can't you hear his master's footsteps approaching?' 33. As they were having a convo, suddenly a messenger showed up and said, 'Yo, this bad situation is from the LORD. Should I even bother waiting for the LORD any longer?' \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 61. And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us. 2. Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may dwell. And he answered, Go ye. 3. And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy servants. And he answered, I will go. 4. So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut down wood. 5. But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was borrowed. {axe head: Heb. iron} 6. And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast {it} in thither; and the iron did swim. 7. Therefore said he, Take {it} up to thee. And he put out his hand, and took it. 8. Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel with his servants, saying, In such and such a place {shall be} my camp. {camp: or, encamping} 9. And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come down. 10. And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once nor twice. 11. Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them, Will ye not shew me which of us {is} for the king of Israel? 12. And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but Elisha, the prophet that {is} in Israel, telleth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber. {None: Heb. No} 13. And he said, Go and spy where he {is}, that I may send and fetch him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, {he is} in Dothan. 14. Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about. {great: Heb. heavy} 15. And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! how shall we do? {the servant: or, the minister} 16. And he answered, Fear not: for they that {be} with us {are} more than they that {be} with them. 17. And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain {was} full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha. 18. And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha. 19. And Elisha said unto them, This {is} not the way, neither {is} this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. But he led them to Samaria. {follow...: Heb. come ye after me} 20. And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these {men}, that they may see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, {they were} in the midst of Samaria. 21. And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite {them}? shall I smite {them}? 22. And he answered, Thou shalt not smite {them}: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink, and go to their master. 23. And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel. 24. And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria. 25. And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they besieged it, until an ass's head was {sold} for fourscore {pieces} of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for five {pieces} of silver. 26. And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king. 27. And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress? {If...: or, Let not the LORD save thee} 28. And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow. 29. So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath hid her son. {next: Heb. other} 30. And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, {he had} sackcloth within upon his flesh. 31. Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day. 32. But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and {the king} sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: {is} not the sound of his master's feet behind him? 33. And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil {is} of the LORD; what should I wait for the LORD any longer? \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 71. So Elisha was like, listen up fam! The word of the LORD is this: Tomorrow at this exact time, you're gonna find some top-quality flour for just a shekel, and two servings of barley for the same price, right there at the entrance of Samaria. 2. So this dude, who was like the king's right-hand man, had the nerve to answer the man of God and be like, 'Yo, even if God opened up windows in heaven, could this really happen?' And the man of God straight up told him, 'Listen up, you'll see it happen but you won't get to enjoy it.' 3. Yo, there were these four dudes with leprosy chillin' at the entrance of the gate. They were like, 'Why are we just sittin' here waitin' to kick the bucket?' 4. Like, if we're like, 'Let's go into the city,' then there's, like, a legit famine in the city and we'll totally die there. And if we just chill here, we'll still die. So, like, let's go and surrender to the Syrian army, and if they spare us, we can live, you know? And if they, like, kill us, well, we'll just be dead, no biggie. 5. And they like totally sneaked out in the evening, to head towards the camp of the Syrians: and when they reached the farthest edge of the Syrian camp, guess what? There wasn't a single soul to be found. 6. Yo, the Lord totally freaked out the Syrians by making them hear a bunch of chariots and horses, like a massive army or something. And they were all like, 'OMG, the king of Israel totally hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us!' 7. So they like, totally panicked and dipped in the evening, abandoning their tents, horses, and donkeys - basically everything at the camp. They straight up ran for their lives, no cap. 8. And when these lepers reached the farthest edge of the camp, they went into one tent and had a feast, enjoying some delicious food and drinks. They also took some silver, gold, and fancy clothes from there and went to hide it. Then they went into another tent and took even more valuable things and hid it there. 9. Then they were like talking to each other, and they were like, 'Yo, we messed up big time, dude. Today is like such a lit day with all these good news, but we're just chilling here in silence like total noobs. If we wait till morning, something bad is gonna go down, for real. So let's go and spill the beans to the king's squad, ASAP. Otherwise, we might get some serious punishment, you know?'} 10. So, like, they went and called the security dude of the city, and they were all like, 'Yo, listen up! We went to the Syrians' camp and guess what? There was nobody! Like, seriously, no one was there, no voices or anything. Just horses and donkeys tied up, and the tents were just chillin' as they were before.' 11. And he called the porters, and they told it to the king's house within. 12. So, like, the king woke up in the middle of the night and was all like, 'Yo, guys, listen up! I'm gonna spill the tea on what those Syrians did to us. They totally know we're starving and stuff, so they sneakily left our camp and hid in the fields. They're probably thinking, 'When those peeps leave the city, we can totally capture them and take over the city.' 13. And one of his servants was like, yo, let's take five of the horses that are still chillin' in the city. They're pretty much all that's left of the Israelites, like, all of 'em that didn't get wiped out, you know? We should send 'em out and see what's up. (in the city: like, in there) 14. So they grabbed two sick rides, and the king slid into DMs of the Syrian squad, like 'Yo, go scope them out.' 15. So they followed them all the way to Jordan, and, guess what, the whole path was covered in clothes and stuff that the Syrians had ditched in a hurry. And then the messengers came back and spilled the tea to the king. 16. And the peeps went out and raided the tents of the Syrians. So, like, a bag of fancy flour costed a shekel, and you could get two bags of barley for the same price. All in accordance with what the LORD said, you know? 17. So the king gave the guy he trusted the most the important job of guarding the gate. But the crowd accidentally trampled all over him at the gate, and he died, just like the man of God predicted when the king went to see him. 18. So, like, the king was chillin' with the man of God, right? And the man of God was all, 'Yo, tomorrow at this time, you'll be able to score two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.' 19. So the boss guy was like, 'Dude, seriously? Can you believe if the big man upstairs actually made windows in the sky? Like, impossible!' And the man of God was like, 'Just you wait, you'll see it happen right before your very eyes, but you won't get to enjoy it.' 20. And that's what happened to him: because everyone stepped all over him at the gate, and he died. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 71. Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time {shall} a measure of fine flour {be sold} for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria. 2. Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, {if} the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see {it} with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. {a lord...: Heb. a lord which belonged to the king leaning upon his hand} 3. And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die? 4. If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine {is} in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die. 5. And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, {there was} no man there. 6. For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, {even} the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us. 7. Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it {was}, and fled for their life. 8. And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid {it}; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence {also}, and went and hid {it}. 9. Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day {is} a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household. {some...: Heb. we shall find punishment} 10. So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, {there was} no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they {were}. 11. And he called the porters; and they told {it} to the king's house within. 12. And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we {be} hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city. 13. And one of his servants answered and said, Let {some} take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they {are} as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, {I say}, they {are} even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see. {in the city: Heb. in it} 14. They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see. 15. And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way {was} full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king. 16. And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was {sold} for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD. 17. And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him. 18. And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria: 19. And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, {if} the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. 20. And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 81. So, Elisha was talking to the woman whose son he brought back to life, and he was like, 'Yo, get up and take your family somewhere else, wherever you can find a place to stay. The big man upstairs called for a famine, and it's gonna hit the land for seven years.' 2. Then the woman got up and did what the man of God said. She took her fam and lived in Philistine territory for seven years. 3. After seven years, the lady came back from Philistine territory and decided to approach the king to plead for her house and land. 4. So the king like chatted with Gehazi, who's, like, the servant of this super holy dude, and he's all like, 'Yo, spill the tea, bro! Let me know all the epic stuff that Elisha has pulled off.' 5. So, like, while he was sharing with the king how he brought back a dead person to life, this woman, whose son he revived, straight up starts crying to the king, asking for her crib and her property. And then Gehazi, he's all like, 'Yo king, this chick and her kid right here, they're the ones Elisha brought back to life.' 6. So, like, when the king asked the woman, she spilled the tea. And then the king was like, 'Alright, I got you.' And he assigned this specific person, like, this officer or whatever, to make sure she gets everything back that was hers, including all the crops that were grown since the day she left, up until now. You know, no one's messing with her stuff anymore. 7. So Elisha rolls up to Damascus, right? And guess what? Benhadad, the king of Syria, is feeling under the weather. Word gets out that the man of God has made his grand entrance in town, ya feel me? 8. So the king was like, yo Hazael, grab a gift and go meet the man of God. Ask him to speak to the LORD, like, will I get better from this sickness or what? 9. So Hazael went to hang out with him and brought a sick gift from Damascus, like all the cool stuff, on the backs of forty camels. He pulled up and stood in front of him, and was like, 'Yo, your son Benhadad, the king of Syria, sent me. He's wondering if he'll recover from this sickness?' {with...: like, he had the gift in his hand} 10. Elisha was like, 'Yo, go tell him he'll totally bounce back, but the big man upstairs told me that he's gonna kick the bucket for real. 11. And he stared without flinching, until he felt embarrassed: and the holy person started crying. 12. And Hazael was like, Yo, why you crying, my lord? And he replied, Bruh, I'm crying 'cause I know all the messed up stuff you're gonna do to the children of Israel. You gonna straight up burn down their fortresses, kill their young dudes with swords, and brutally attack their pregnant women and kids. It's just heavy, man. 13. And Hazael was like, hold up, am I some kind of dog that I should do this epic thing? But Elisha was like, yo, the LORD straight up revealed to me that you're gonna be the king of Syria. 14. So he left Elisha and went to his boss, who asked him, 'What did Elisha say to you?' And he replied, 'He told me that you'll definitely get better.' 15. The next day, he grabbed a big cloth, dunked it in water, and put it over his face. He ended up dying, and Hazael took over as king. 16. And in the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, ruling as king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, who was the king of Judah at that time, passed the torch to his son, Jehoram, who took over as the new king of Judah. 17. He was 32 years old when he became king, and he ruled over Jerusalem for 8 years. 18. And he totally followed the footsteps of the kings of Israel, just like the fam of Ahab: 'cause he married the daughter of Ahab, and he did all kinds of messed up things that totally didn't sit well with the LORD. 19. But the LORD didn't want to wipe out Judah because of his promise to David, his loyal servant. He promised to always bring hope to David and his descendants. 20. Back in the day, Edom totally did their own thing and ditched Judah. They went ahead and crowned their own king and everything. 21. So Joram went to Zair with all his crew of chariots. And then, under the cover of darkness, he launched a surprise attack on the Edomites who were surrounding him, taking down both the chariot leaders and the captains. The Edomite forces were left stunned and the remaining people fled back to their tents. 22. But Edom said, 'Nah, we outta here!' and broke away from Judah, and they're still doin' their own thing till now. And then Libnah was like, 'Same energy!' and rebelled too. 23. Yo, like, everything else Joram did, and all the deets, are they not all written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 24. And Joram passed away, joining his ancestors, and was laid to rest in the city of David. Afterward, his son Ahaziah took over as ruler. {Ahaziah: also known as Azariah and Jehoahaz} 25. So, like, in the twelfth year of Joram, you know, Ahab's son, being all king of Israel and stuff, Ahaziah, Jehoram's son, started his reign as king of Judah. 26. Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king, and he ruled over Jerusalem for one year. His mom, Athaliah, was the daughter of Omri, who was the king of Israel. 27. And he totally followed in the footsteps of the house of Ahab, and did some seriously messed up stuff that the LORD was not happy about, just like the house of Ahab did. 'Cause you know what? He was actually married into the house of Ahab. Yikes! 28. So, like, he totally joined forces with Joram, you know, Ahab's son, to face off against Hazael, the king of Syria in Ramothgilead. And dang, those Syrians totally got the best of Joram and gave him some serious wounds. 29. So King Joram went to Jezreel to get patched up from the beat down he got from the Syrians in Ramah while fighting against Hazael, the king of Syria. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, went to visit Joram, the son of Ahab, in Jezreel because he was injured. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 81. Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years. 2. And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. 3. And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land. 4. And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done. 5. And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this {is} the woman, and this {is} her son, whom Elisha restored to life. 6. And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that {was} hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now. {officer: or, eunuch} 7. And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither. 8. And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? 9. So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? {with...: Heb. in his hand} 10. And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die. 11. And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept. {stedfastly: Heb. and set it} 12. And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child. 13. And Hazael said, But what, {is} thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou {shalt be} king over Syria. 14. So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me {that} thou shouldest surely recover. 15. And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped {it} in water, and spread {it} on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead. 16. And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel, Jehoshaphat {being} then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah began to reign. {began...: Heb. reigned} 17. Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 18. And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD. 19. Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, {and} to his children. {light: Heb. candle, or, lamp} 20. In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made a king over themselves. 21. So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents. 22. Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. 23. And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 24. And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. {Ahaziah: also called, Azariah, and Jehoahaz} 25. In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign. 26. Two and twenty years old {was} Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel. {daughter: or, granddaughter} 27. And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as {did} the house of Ahab: for he {was} the son in law of the house of Ahab. 28. And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram. 29. And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick. {which...: Heb. wherewith the Syrians had wounded} {Ramah: called Ramoth} {sick: Heb. wounded} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 91. Elisha, the prophet, told one of the young prophets, 'Get ready and grab this tub of oil, then head over to Ramothgilead.' 2. When you get there, find this guy named Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat and Nimshi. Tell him to get up from hanging out with his bros and bring him to a private room within a room. 3. Now grab that oil bottle, pour it all over his head and be like, 'Yo, God said you're the king of Israel'. After that, bolt out the door as fast as you can and don't look back, man. 4. And then this young dude, who also happens to be a prophet, went over to Ramothgilead. 5. And when he arrived, like, the head honchos of the squad were chilling there, and he was like, 'Yo, I got a message for you, Captain.' And Jehu was all like, 'Uh, which one of us you talkin' to?' And he was all like, 'Nah, man, I mean you, Captain.' 6. So, he got up and went inside the house. He took the oil and poured it on his head, and then he said to him, 'Yo, this is what the LORD God of Israel is saying: I've chosen you to be the king over the people of the LORD, like, specifically over Israel. 7. You gotta wreck the crib of Ahab, your boss, so I can get back at Jezebel for spillin' the blood of my crew, the prophets, and all the LORD's homies. 8. The entire Ahab crew is going down: I'll wipe out all the dudes who pee standing up and those who are left in Israel! 9. And I'm gonna totally wreck Ahab's fam, just like I did to Jeroboam, Nebat's kid, and Baasha, Ahijah's son. 10. And, like, the dogs are totally gonna devour Jezebel in Jezreel, and there won't be anyone to give her a proper burial. Then, this dude just peaced out by opening the door and running away. 11. So, Jehu goes up to his lord's servants, right? And one of them asks him, 'Yo, everything cool? Why did this crazy dude come to see you?' And Jehu is like, 'You know the guy and what he's all about.' 12. So they were like, 'Nah, that can't be true! Spill the beans already!' Then he was like, 'Listen up, fam. This is what he said to me, straight from the man upstairs. The LORD said, 'I've officially crowned you as the king of Israel.' 13. Then they quickly grabbed their own clothes and placed them under him, on the top of the stairs, and blew on trumpets, shouting, 'Jehu is the king!'} 14. So this guy named Jehu, who was the son of Jehoshaphat and the grandson of Nimshi, decided to plot against Joram. (Oh, by the way, Joram was the dude who ruled over Ramothgilead with all of Israel because they were worried about Hazael, the king of Syria. 15. So, King Joram went back to Jezreel to get healed from the injuries that the Syrians gave him during his battle with Hazael, the king of Syria. Then Jehu said, 'If you're down with this plan, let no one leave the city to go and spill the tea in Jezreel. No one's escaping, alright?' 16. Jehu hops in a sick chariot and heads to Jezreel where Joram is chilling. Oh, and by the way, Ahaziah, the king of Judah, came down to visit Joram. 17. There was this dude chilling on the tower in Jezreel, and he spotted Jehu and his homies rolling up. He was like, 'Yo, I see a crew coming through.' Then Joram was like, 'Send a messenger on a horse to check them out and ask if everything's cool.' 18. So this person on a horse went to meet him and said, like, the king's vibe is like, 'Are we chillin' here?' And Jehu was all like, 'What's peace gotta do with me, man? You can follow me if you want.' And the lookout dude was like, 'Yo, the messenger reached them but he ain't coming back.' 19. Then he, like, sent another dude on a horse, who rolled up to them and was like, 'Yo, the king says, 'What's up? Is everything chill?' And Jehu was like, 'Why you asking about peace? Ain't got nothin' to do with me, bro. Just follow me.' 20. So the lookout said, like, 'Yo, he totally came to them, but he ain't coming back - and his driving skills are on another level, just like Jehu, son of Nimshi. He's like on a whole 'nother speed, driving all crazy and wild.' 21. So Joram was like, 'Get ready!' And his chariot was, like, all set. Then Joram, the king of Israel, and Ahaziah, the king of Judah, both hopped in their chariots and they like, totally went out to confront Jehu. And they actually found him chilling in the land that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite. 22. So, like, when Joram saw Jehu, he was all like, 'Hey man, everything cool?' And Jehu was like, 'Dude, there's no way anything's cool with all the messed up stuff your mom Jezebel is doing. She's got all these witchcraft things going on, it's not cool at all.' 23. Joram dipped outta there real quick and was like, 'Yo Ahaziah, something shady's going down, bro.' 24. So Jehu grabbed a bow and gave it all he had, hitting Jehoram right in the middle of his arms. The arrow went straight through his heart and he collapsed in his chariot. 25. So Jehu told Bidkar, his chief, 'Yo, grab him and throw him into Naboth the Jezreelite's field, 'cause let's not forget, back when me and you were riding with Ahab his pops, the big man upstairs dropped this whole thing on him, you know?' 26. Yo, I saw with my own eyes yesterday how Naboth and his sons got done dirty, says the LORD. And I ain't gonna let that slide. So, I'm telling you, toss him into that very same plot of land, just like the LORD said. Don't mess with me, I know what's up. 27. But yo, when Ahaziah, the king of Judah, peeped the situation, he dipped through the garden house. And Jehu chased after him like, 'Yo, hit him up in the chariot too.' And they did exactly that when they reached Gur by Ibleam. Ahaziah bounced to Megiddo and met his demise there. 28. And his homies rolled him in a lit whip to Jerusalem, and laid him to rest in his fam's crib in the city of David. 29. And when Joram's kid, Ahaziah, hit his eleventh year on the throne, he started being the ruler of Judah. 30. So, like, Jehu arrived in Jezreel, and Jezebel totally heard about it and decided to do her makeup, style her hair, and show herself off at a window. She went all out with her eye makeup, you know? 31. So, like, when Jehu walked through the gate, she was like, 'Yo, did Zimri have peace after killing his master?' 32. And he looked up at the window and asked, 'Who's got my back? Who?' And then two or three of his homies checked it out and looked out for him. 33. And he was like, 'Yo, yeet her down.' So they straight up yeeted her down: and like, some of her blood got all splashed on the wall and the horses too, and he straight up trampled on her. 34. And when he arrived, he ate and drank, and he was like, 'Yo, go check out this woman who's got some bad juju, and give her a proper burial, 'cause she's, like, a royalty.' 35. So, like, they went to bury her, right? But all they found was, like, the skull, the feet, and, you know, the palms of her hands. Pretty crazy, tbh. 36. So they went back and told him what happened. And he was like, bruh, this is literal words from the LORD that he spoke through his servant Elijah the Tishbite. He straight-up said that in Jezreel, Jezebel's body is gonna get chowed down by some hungry dogs. By the way, that 'by' is just another way of saying 'through.' 37. And Jezebel's dead body will be like poop on the ground in the land of Jezreel; nobody will even say, 'That's Jezebel!' \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 91. And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead: 2. And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber; {inner...: Heb. chamber in a chamber} 3. Then take the box of oil, and pour {it} on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not. 4. So the young man, {even} the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead. 5. And when he came, behold, the captains of the host {were} sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain. 6. And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, {even} over Israel. 7. And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel. 8. For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel: 9. And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah: 10. And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and {there shall be} none to bury {her}. And he opened the door, and fled. 11. Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and {one} said unto him, {Is} all well? wherefore came this mad {fellow} to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication. 12. And they said, {It is} false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. 13. Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put {it} under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king. {is king: Heb. reigneth} 14. So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria. 15. But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, {then} let none go forth {nor} escape out of the city to go to tell {it} in Jezreel. {Joram: Heb. Jehoram but not in verse sixteen} {had given: Heb. smote} {let none...: Heb. let no escaper go, etc} 16. So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram. 17. And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, {Is it} peace? 18. So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, {Is it} peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again. 19. Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, {Is it} peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. 20. And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving {is} like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously. {driving: or, marching} {furiously: Heb. in madness} 21. And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. {Make ready: Heb. Bind} {met: Heb. found} 22. And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, {Is it} peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts {are so} many? 23. And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, {There is} treachery, O Ahaziah. 24. And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. {drew...: Heb. filled his hand with a bow} {sunk: Heb. bowed} 25. Then said {Jehu} to Bidkar his captain, Take up, {and} cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him; 26. Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take {and} cast him into the plat {of ground}, according to the word of the LORD. {blood: Heb. bloods} {plat: or, portion} 27. But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw {this}, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. {And they did so} at the going up to Gur, which {is} by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there. 28. And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David. 29. And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah. 30. And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard {of it}; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window. {painted...: Heb. put her eyes in painting} 31. And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, {Had} Zimri peace, who slew his master? 32. And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who {is} on my side? who? And there looked out to him two {or} three eunuchs. {eunuchs: or, chamberlains} 33. And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and {some} of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot. 34. And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed {woman}, and bury her: for she {is} a king's daughter. 35. And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of {her} hands. 36. Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This {is} the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel: {by: Heb. by the hand of} 37. And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; {so} that they shall not say, This {is} Jezebel. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 101. So like, Ahab had a whole squad of 70 sons living it up in Samaria. Then Jehu, being the real influencer he is, decided to slide into the DMs of the rulers of Jezreel and the OG elders who raised those Ahab's peeps. He sent them some lit letters, making his intentions known. 2. Yo, once you receive this letter, just know that your boss's sons are with you, and y'all have chariots, horses, a dope city, and armor. Just sayin'. 3. Find the most talented and worthy of your master's sons, and place them on their father's throne, ready to defend your master's house. 4. But they were super scared, like, omg, and were like, okay, two kings couldn't stand against him, so how are we gonna stand up to him? 5. And the boss man, the city manager, the cool elders, and the child raisers all sent a message to Jehu, saying, 'We've got your back, man. We'll do whatever you ask. We won't crown anyone else as king. Just do what you think is right, bro.' 6. So he sent another message to them and said, If you're loyal to me and willing to listen to what I say, gather up the heads of your master's sons, and meet me in Jezreel by tomorrow. There were about seventy of the king's sons, hanging out with some important people in the city who raised them. 7. Yo, when they got that letter, they straight up went and took the king's sons and killed seventy peeps. Then, they put their heads in baskets and sent 'em to Jezreel. 8. Yo, so this messenger showed up and was like, 'Yo, check it, they brought the heads of the king's sons.' And he was like, 'Just like, put 'em in two piles at the entrance of the gate till morning, ya know?' 9. So the next morning, he went out, stood up, and said to everyone, 'Listen up, y'all! Check this out, I totally planned and carried out the removal of my master. But here's the thing, who's responsible for taking down all these people?' 10. Just so you know, every single thing the LORD said about the house of Ahab will definitely happen. God totally kept His word through His servant Elijah. No doubt about it! 11. So Jehu totally wiped out everyone from the Ahab fam in Jezreel, including all the big shots, their homies, and their holy peeps, leaving none of 'em alive. {kinsfolks: or, acquaintances} 12. So he got up and left, heading towards Samaria. While he was on his way, he stopped by a place where shearing was happening, you know, where the shepherds were taking care of their sheep. 13. Jehu ran into the homies of Ahaziah, the king of Judah, and was like, 'Yo, who y'all be?' And they were like, 'We the bros of Ahaziah, just tryna show some love to the royal kids, you know, the king's and queen's children.' 14. So he was like, 'Capture them, don't let them escape.' And they totally caught them and got rid of all forty-two dudes at the pit near the shearing house. Seriously, not a single one was left. 15. And as he left that place, he came across Jehonadab, Rechab's son, who was coming to meet him. He greeted him and asked if they were on the same wavelength, if their hearts were aligned. Jehonadab replied, 'Absolutely!' If that's the case, give me a sign. So, they shook hands, and he invited Jehonadab to join him in the chariot. 16. And he was like, 'Yo, come chill with me and witness my fire for the LORD.' So they let him roll in his whip. 17. And when he arrived in Samaria, he took down everyone who was left of Ahab's crew, until he wiped them out completely, just like the LORD had said to Elijah. 18. So, Jehu gathered everyone and was like, 'Listen up y'all, Ahab kinda worshiped Baal a bit, but guess what? I'm gonna worship him big time!' 19. So, like, summon all the prophets, servants, and priests of Baal, like every single one of them. No one should be left out, okay? 'Cause I'm about to make this huge sacrifice to Baal, and anyone who doesn't show up won't, like, survive. But Jehu was super sneaky about it, you know, because he wanted to totally wipe out all those people who worshipped Baal. 20. Jehu was like, 'Yo, let's have a lit gathering for Baal. And they were like, 'Bet, let's make it happen.' 21. So Jehu sent a message to all of Israel, and all the people who worshipped Baal showed up. Literally, every single person came. They all gathered at the house of Baal, and let me tell you, that place was packed wall to wall. Like, there wasn't even a little breathing space! It was so crowded, they were practically standing with their mouths touching each other. Crazy, right? 22. Then he told the person in charge of the wardrobe, 'Get some fresh outfits for all the Baal worshippers.' And he did as he was told and brought out the outfits. 23. So Jehu and Jehonadab, Rechab's kid, went to the Baal's crib and told the Baal stans to peep that there's only true Baal followers here, no servants of the LORD allowed. 24. And when they went to make sacrifices and burn offerings, Jehu gathered eighty guys outside and said, 'If any of the dudes I brought to you manages to escape, whoever sets him free will pay with their own life.' 25. And once he finished making the burnt offering, Jehu told the guard and the captains, 'Go in and take them out - no one should escape!' So they attacked them with swords, and the guard and the captains threw them out before heading to the city where the house of Baal was located. 26. So they took those statues from Baal's house and totally yeeted them into the fire. 27. And they totally destroyed the statue of Baal, smashed the entire temple of Baal, and turned it into a freaking public restroom that exists to this day. 28. So Jehu totally wiped out Baal from Israel. 29. But Jehu didn't stop following the sins of Jeroboam, the dude who led Israel astray. Specifically, the golden calves in Bethel and Dan, he was all about them. 30. And God was like, 'Yo Jehu, you totally killed it by doing what's right in my eyes and doing exactly what I wanted you to do to Ahab's family. So, your descendants up until the fourth generation will be chilling on the throne of Israel.' 31. But Jehu didn't really care about following the law of the LORD God of Israel wholeheartedly. He didn't stop himself from committing the same sins as Jeroboam, which led Israel astray. 32. Back in the day, the LORD started reducing Israel's territory. Hazael went all out and attacked them in every part of Israel; 'reducing' here means cutting off their borders. 33. Yo, from the Jordan River going east, the whole land of Gilead belongs to the peeps of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh. It stretches from Aroer by the Arnon River all the way to Gilead and Bashan. Aroer is on the east side, you know, where the sun comes up. 34. So, like, there's more stuff that Jehu did, and all his crazy power moves, you know? It's all in this book called the chronicles of the kings of Israel, fam. Did you check it out? 35. And Jehu passed away, and they laid him to rest in Samaria. Then Jehoahaz, his son, became the new ruler. 36. Jehu was in charge of Israel in Samaria for a solid 28 years. It was a good run, no doubt. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 101. And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's {children}, saying, {them...: Heb. nourishers} 2. Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's sons {are} with you, and {there are} with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armour; 3. Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and set {him} on his father's throne, and fight for your master's house. 4. But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand? 5. And he that {was} over the house, and he that {was} over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up {of the children}, sent to Jehu, saying, We {are} thy servants, and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou {that which is} good in thine eyes. 6. Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye {be} mine, and {if} ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, {being} seventy persons, {were} with the great men of the city, which brought them up. {mine: Heb. for me} 7. And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him {them} to Jezreel. 8. And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning. 9. And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, Ye {be} righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these? 10. Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD hath done {that} which he spake by his servant Elijah. {by: Heb. by the hand of} 11. So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining. {kinsfolks: or, acquaintance} 12. And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. {And} as he {was} at the shearing house in the way, {shearing...: Heb. house of shepherds binding sheep} 13. Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who {are} ye? And they answered, We {are} the brethren of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen. {met with: Heb. found} {to salute...: Heb. to the peace of, etc} 14. And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, {even} two and forty men; neither left he any of them. 15. And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab {coming} to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart {is} with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give {me} thine hand. And he gave {him} his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot. {lighted on: Heb. found} {saluted: Heb. blessed} 16. And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot. 17. And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah. 18. And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little; {but} Jehu shall serve him much. 19. Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice {to do} to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did {it} in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal. 20. And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed {it}. {Proclaim: Heb. Sanctify} 21. And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another. {full...: or, so full that they stood mouth to mouth} 22. And he said unto him that {was} over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments. 23. And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only. 24. And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, {If} any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, {he that letteth him go}, his life {shall be} for the life of him. 25. And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, {and} slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast {them} out, and went to the city of the house of Baal. {the edge: Heb. the mouth} 26. And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them. {images: Heb. statues} 27. And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day. 28. Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel. 29. Howbeit {from} the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, {to wit}, the golden calves that {were} in Bethel, and that {were} in Dan. 30. And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in executing {that which is} right in mine eyes, {and} hast done unto the house of Ahab according to all that {was} in mine heart, thy children of the fourth {generation} shall sit on the throne of Israel. 31. But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin. {took...: Heb. observed not} 32. In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel; {to cut: Heb. to cut off the ends} 33. From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which {is} by the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan. {eastward: Heb. toward the rising of the sun} {even...: or, even to Gilead and Bashan} 34. Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 35. And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead. 36. And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria {was} twenty and eight years. {the time: Heb. the days were} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 111. So, like, when Athaliah, Ahaziah's mom, realized her son had kicked the bucket, she got all triggered and straight-up wiped out the entire royal bloodline. #RIP 2. Jehosheba, who was king Joram's daughter and Ahaziah's sister, snatched up Joash, Ahaziah's son, and rescued him from among the other royal kids who were killed. She hid him and his nurse in a secret room away from Athaliah, so he wouldn't get killed. (Jehosheba was sometimes called Jehoshabeath, and Joash was also known as Jehoash.) 3. So, like, he kept it lowkey and stayed at the crib of the LORD for a solid six years. And Athaliah was totally ruling the land, man. 4. In the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the big shots and the bouncers, and brought them to the crib of the LORD. He made a deal with them, and they swore to him inside the crib of the LORD. Then he introduced them to the king's kid. 5. So he was like, listen up guys, here's what you gotta do: one-third of you that come in on the Sabbath, you'll be in charge of guarding the king's crib, okay? 6. And one third shall be at the Sur gate, and one third at the guard's gate in the back: this is how you'll maintain the security of the house, preventing any damage or break-ins. 7. And two groups of all of you who go out on the sabbath, they will be in charge of guarding the house of the LORD where the king stays. {groups: or, squads: Hebrew version says 'hands'} 8. Surround the king, everyone holding weapons, and anyone who gets too close will be taken out. Stay by the king's side as he comes and goes. 9. The squad leaders followed all the orders given by Priest Jehoiada: They gathered their respective crews, including those who were on duty and those who were off duty on Sabbath, and went to meet Priest Jehoiada. 10. The priest gave King David's spears and shields, which were in the temple of the LORD, to the leaders of the hundreds. 11. And the squad was all geared up, each guy holding their weapons, surrounding the king, from one temple corner to the other, covering the whole area near the altar and the temple. (corner: meaning shoulder in Hebrew) 12. And he brought out the king's son, and placed the crown on his head, and gave him the official documents; and they declared him king, and anointed him; and they cheered and said, Long live the king. 13. When Athaliah heard all the commotion from the guards and the crowd, she went to the temple where the LORD was. 14. And then, like, she saw the king standing by a pillar, just doing his thing, and the important people and the trumpeters were all by the king, and everyone in the land was stoked and started blowing their trumpets. And Athaliah totally freaked out, tore her clothes, and yelled, 'Betrayal, betrayal!' 15. Yo, Jehoiada the priest straight up told the leaders and soldiers, 'Yo, bring her out of here, no chill, and if anyone tryna stick by her, slash 'em with a sword. The priest don't want her killed up in the Lord's crib.' 16. And they grabbed her, and she walked along the path that the horses used to enter the king's house, and that's where she got killed. 17. And Jehoiada, like, made this pact between God and the king and the people, ya know? It was like an agreement, bruh, that they would all be God's peeps and stuff. It was all about bringing them together, like uniting the king and the people, ya feel me? 18. Then everyone in the land went to the crib of Baal and totally wrecked it. They destroyed all his shrines and images, and they even took out Mattan, the priest of Baal, right in front of the shrines. After that, the priest appointed some people to take charge of the gig at the house of the LORD. {officers: like, government peeps appointed by the priest} 19. So, he gathered all the big shots, the leaders, the guards, and all the people in the land. They brought down the king from the sacred house of the LORD and went through the gate of the guards to the king's palace. And there he sat on the royal throne. 20. And everyone was super hyped, and the whole city was lowkey chill, and they straight up took down Athaliah with a sword right near the king's crib. 21. Jehoash was only seven years old when he started ruling the kingdom. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 111. And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. {seed...: Heb. seed of the kingdom} 2. But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons {which were} slain; and they hid him, {even} him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain. {Jehosheba: also called, Jehoshabeath} {Joash: also called, Jehoash} 3. And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land. 4. And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son. 5. And he commanded them, saying, This {is} the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house; 6. And a third part {shall be} at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down. {that...: or, from breaking up} 7. And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king. {parts: or, companies: Heb. hands} 8. And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in. 9. And the captains over the hundreds did according to all {things} that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. 10. And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that {were} in the temple of the LORD. 11. And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, {along} by the altar and the temple. {corner: Heb. shoulder} 12. And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and {gave him} the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king. {God...: Heb. Let the king live} 13. And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard {and} of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD. 14. And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner {was}, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason. 15. But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD. 16. And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain. 17. And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD'S people; between the king also and the people. 18. And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD. {officers: Heb. offices} 19. And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings. 20. And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword {beside} the king's house. 21. Seven years old {was} Jehoash when he began to reign. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 121. In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash took over as king and ruled for forty years in Jerusalem. His mom, Zibiah from Beersheba, held it down. 2. Jehoash totally knew what's up and did all the right things according to the LORD as long as Jehoiada the priest was his guide. 3. But, um, they didn't like, get rid of those worship spots, ya know? Like, people were still doing sacrifices and, like, burning incense at those high places. 4. So Jehoash told the priests, all the cash that people bring to the Lord's house as donations, whether it's a specific amount or whatever someone feels like giving, it's all considered holy. Everyone's got a choice in how much they want to give, it's all up to them and what they feel in their hearts. 5. The priests are gonna grab their squad and handle it: they'll fix up any spots in the crib that need some fixing. 6. So, like, in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, the priests totally didn't fix up the damaged parts of the house. It's kinda crazy, right? They just left it broken and stuff. (By the way, the twenty-third year is like the third year too, just so you know.) 7. So King Jehoash was like, 'Yo, Jehoiada the priest and all the other priests, what's up? Why aren't y'all fixing the broken parts of the house?' He basically told them, 'If you ain't gonna fix it, don't expect no more funds from your homies. Use that money to fix up the house instead.' 8. So, like, the priests were totally cool with not taking any more cash from the peeps, and they were like, 'Nah, we won't fix up the damages in the crib.' 9. So Jehoiada, the priest, grabbed a chest and drilled a hole in its lid. He placed the chest next to the altar, on the right side as you walk into the house of the LORD. Then the priests who guarded the entrance put all the money that was brought into the house of the LORD inside the chest. 10. So, like, when they saw that there was a ton of cash in the chest, the king's scribe and the high priest came over. They put the money in bags and counted it out, all the cash they found in the house of the LORD. (By the way, 'scribe' means 'secretary' and 'put up' means 'bound up' in Hebrew.) 11. So they handed over the money to the ones in charge of the construction of the house of the LORD. They gave it to the carpenters and builders who were working on the house of the LORD. 12. And for builders, stoneworkers, and acquiring materials like wood and cut stones to fix up the damaged parts of the house of the LORD, and for all the expenses required to repair it. 13. But the house of the LORD didn't have any sick silver bowls, shiny snuffers, dope basons, lit trumpets, or any gold or silver items bought for cash and brought in. 14. But they gave that to the work crew, and used it to fix up the house of the LORD. 15. And they didn't even bother keeping track of the guys they gave the money to for the work. But hey, those dudes were trustworthy and played it straight. 16. Yo, they didn't bring that trespass money and sin money up in the house of the LORD, that was for the priests, fam. 17. So, like, this dude named Hazael, who was king of Syria, totally went up and fought against Gath, and, get this, he actually conquered it! And then Hazael was all like, 'I'm headed to Jerusalem next!' 18. So, Jehoash, the king of Judah, gathered up all the sacred stuff that his dads, Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, had dedicated. He also got his own sacred stuff, plus all the gold that was stashed away in the house of the LORD and the king's house. Then, he sent all that loot to Hazael, the king of Syria, and he bounced from Jerusalem. (He literally went up, yo.) 19. Yo, you wanna know more about Joash and the cool stuff he did? Check out the book of chronicles of the kings of Judah, bro. It's got all the juicy deets about his life and his dope accomplishments. 20. So, like, his peeps got together and plotted secretly, and then they killed Joash up in Millo, which connects to Silla. {the house...: or, Bethmillo} 21. Jozachar, son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of Shomer, his homies, straight up took him down and he got finished; they laid him to rest alongside his peeps in the city of David. Then his son Amaziah took over the throne. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 121. In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Zibiah of Beersheba. 2. And Jehoash did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him. 3. But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places. 4. And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD, {even} the money of every one that passeth {the account}, the money that every man is set at, {and} all the money that cometh into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD, {dedicated things: or, holy things: Heb. holinesses} {that every...: Heb. of the souls of his estimation} {cometh...: Heb. ascendeth upon the heart of a man} 5. Let the priests take {it} to them, every man of his acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house, wheresoever any breach shall be found. 6. But it was {so, that} in the three and twentieth year of king Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house. {three...: Heb. twentieth year and third year} 7. Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the {other} priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receive no {more} money of your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house. 8. And the priests consented to receive no {more} money of the people, neither to repair the breaches of the house. 9. But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money {that was} brought into the house of the LORD. {door: Heb. threshold} 10. And it was {so}, when they saw that {there was} much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the house of the LORD. {scribe: or, secretary} {put...: Heb. bound up} 11. And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders, that wrought upon the house of the LORD, {laid...: Heb. brought it forth} 12. And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair {it}. {was...: Heb. went forth} 13. Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money {that was} brought into the house of the LORD: 14. But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the house of the LORD. 15. Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt faithfully. 16. The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'. 17. Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem. 18. And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold {that was} found in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and in the king's house, and sent {it} to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem. {went...: Heb. went up} 19. And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 20. And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla. {the house...: or, Bethmillo} 21. For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 131. So, like, when Joash, Ahaziah's son, was king of Judah for 23 years, Jehoahaz, you know, Jehu's son, took over as king of Israel in Samaria and ruled for 17 years. 2. And he, like, totally messed up in the eyes of the LORD, and, like, followed in the wicked footsteps of Jeroboam, Nebat's son, which, like, caused all of Israel to sin; he didn't even try to turn away. (followed: Hebrew for walked after) 3. God got really ticked off at Israel, so he let Hazael, the king of Syria, and Benhadad (Hazael's son) rule over them for a long time. 4. Jehoahaz reached out to the LORD and the LORD listened to him, because He saw that Israel was dealing with some serious hardship, with the king of Syria really pressing them down.  5. And God hooked up Israel with a hero, so they could finally escape the clutches of the Syrians. And the Israelites went back to chilling in their tents, just like they used to. {as beforetime: Like, it was lit as it was yesterday, and the day before that} 6. But they didn't stop doing the same messed up stuff as Jeroboam and leading Israel astray. They just kept going down that path, and the shady grove in Samaria was still there too, as a constant reminder. 7. But he only let Jehoahaz keep like, 50 horse riders, 10 chariots, and 10k foot soldiers, 'cause the king of Syria straight up wrecked them and turned them into straight-up dust like how you're threshing wheat. 8. So, like, everything else that Jehoahaz did, all his accomplishments and everything, you can totally find that in the kings of Israel history book, you know? 9. And Jehoahaz passed away, and they laid him to rest in Samaria. His son, Joash, took over as the new ruler. (Joash was also known as Jehoash.) 10. In the thirty-seventh year of Joash, the king of Judah, Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, started ruling over Israel in Samaria. He reigned for sixteen years. 11. And he like, totally messed up in God's eyes, didn't even stop doing the same sins as Jeroboam, the dude who caused all of Israel to sin. He was just going along with it, no second thoughts. 12. Yo, there's actually a bunch of other stuff that Joash did, like seriously, it's all written down in this book called the chronicles of the kings of Israel. He showed his strength and straight up fought against Amaziah, who was king of Judah. It's all in there if you wanna check it out! 13. And Joash passed away, joining his ancestors; while Jeroboam took his place on the throne. They laid Joash to rest in Samaria with the other kings of Israel. 14. So like, Elisha got really sick and unfortunately, he passed away. Then, Joash, the king of Israel, went to see him and started crying, like tears flowing down his face. He was like, 'Oh man, my father, my father, you were like the ultimate ride or die for Israel, leading us to victory like a chariot with its strong horsemen.' 15. Elisha was like, 'Yo, grab a bow and some arrows.' So, the dude got himself a bow and some arrows. 16. And he was like, yo, king of Israel, put your hand on the bow. So the king was like, bet, and he placed his hand on it. Then Elisha was like, alright, and he put his hands on top of the king's hands. It was a real power move, you know? 17. Then he was like, 'Yo, open the window towards the east.' So he opened it. Then Elisha was like, 'Aim and shoot!'. And he did. And Elisha was like, 'This arrow represents the LORD's deliverance, and it'll bring deliverance from Syria. You're gonna totally crush the Syrians in Aphek until there's nothing left.' 18. Then he was like, 'Yo, grab those arrows.' So he grabbed them. And he was all like, 'Hey, king of Israel, beat them arrows on the ground.' So the king, like, hit the ground three times and then stopped. 19. The guy of God got super mad at him and said, 'Dude, you should've hit 'em like five or six times, then you would've totally wrecked Syria until it was gone. But now you're only gonna hit 'em three times, man.' 20. So, like, Elisha passed away and they gave him a proper burial and everything. But, yo, at the start of the new year, these Moabite gangs straight up invaded the land, can you believe that? 21. So, there was this one time when some people were burying a dude, right? And then, out of nowhere, they noticed a group of guys nearby. They got a crazy idea and decided to throw the dead guy into the tomb where Elisha's bones were kept. And guess what? As soon as the dead guy touched Elisha's bones, he came back to life and stood up on his feet, like, totally revived and all, you know? 22. Yo, this dude Hazael, the king of Syria, straight up gave Israel a hard time throughout the entire reign of Jehoahaz. 23. And God was like, totally chill with them, showing mad love and respect, all because of the promise he made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He didn't even think about wiping them out or kicking them out of his squad, like, not even once. {presence: Hebrew word for face} 24. Hazael, the king of Syria, passed away and his son, Benhadad, took over as the new ruler. 25. So Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, snatched back the cities from Benhadad, Hazael's son, that he had previously taken from Jehoahaz, his father, in a fierce battle. Joash managed to defeat him three times and reclaim the cities of Israel. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 131. In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} seventeen years. {three...: Heb. twentieth year and third year} 2. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, and followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom. {followed: Heb. walked after} 3. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all {their} days. 4. And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of Syria oppressed them. 5. (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime. {as beforetime: Heb. as yesterday, and third day} 6. Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, {but} walked therein: and there remained the grove also in Samaria.) {walked: Heb. he walked} {remained: Heb. stood} 7. Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing. 8. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 9. And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead. {Joash: also called, Jehoash} 10. In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} sixteen years. 11. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD; he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin: {but} he walked therein. 12. And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 13. And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel. 14. Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. 15. And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took unto him bow and arrows. 16. And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the bow. And he put his hand {upon it}: and Elisha put his hands upon the king's hands. {Put thine...: Heb. Make thine hand to ride} 17. And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened {it}. Then Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the LORD'S deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have consumed {them}. 18. And he said, Take the arrows. And he took {them}. And he said unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed. 19. And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed {it}: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria {but} thrice. 20. And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year. 21. And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band {of men}; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet. {was...: Heb. went down} 22. But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz. 23. And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast he them from his presence as yet. {presence: Heb. face} 24. So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead. 25. And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel. {took...: Heb. returned and took} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 141. So, like, right after Joash, Jehoahaz's son, had been king of Israel for two years, Amaziah, who's Joash's son and king of Judah, started to reign. 2. He was 25 years old when he started ruling and ruled for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mom's name was Jehoaddan and she was from Jerusalem. 3. And he was, like, totally doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD, but, you know, not exactly like his dad David. He was just following in the footsteps of his dad Joash and doing everything he did. 4. But, like, they didn't even bother to get rid of the high places. People were still sacrificing and burning incense up there, you know? 5. And like, once he totally got the kingdom under control, he straight up took out his servants who were responsible for killing his own dad, the king. 6. But he didn't kill the children of the murderers, because that goes against what it says in the book of the law of Moses. The LORD commanded that nobody should be put to death for someone else's crimes. Each person should be held accountable for their own wrongdoing. 7. He totally crushed Edom in the valley of salt, like ten thousand gone! Then he straight up conquered Selah, and named it Joktheel, which it's called till now. Oh, and BTW, Selah also means 'the rock' just FYI. 8. So Amaziah DM'd Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, the king of Israel, like, yo dude, let's meet up and have a face-to-face convo. 9. So, like, Jehoash, the king of Israel, hit up Amaziah, the king of Judah, and was all like, 'Yo, bro! So check it, that little dinky thistle in Lebanon messaged the big ol' cedar in Lebanon, asking if his daughter could marry his son. But then, outta nowhere, this wild beast in Lebanon came and totally stomped on that puny thistle.' 10. You really did destroy Edom, and you're feeling pretty confident about it. Celebrate that victory and stay put at home, okay? There's no need for you to get involved in anything that could end up hurting you and causing both you and Judah to fall. Stay safe and sound in your own crib! 11. But Amaziah was like, 'Nah, not gonna listen.' So then Jehoash, the king of Israel, decided to go and have a face-off with Amaziah, the king of Judah. They met up at Bethshemesh, which is part of Judah. 12. And Judah totally got wrecked by Israel; they dipped out and ran back to their tents. 13. So, Jehoash, the king of Israel, totally captured Amaziah, the king of Judah, who's the son of Jehoash and grandson of Ahaziah, right? It all went down in Bethshemesh. Then, he rolled into Jerusalem and straight up wrecked the wall from the Ephraim gate to the corner gate, like, it was four hundred cubits of pure destruction. 14. So, like, he totally snagged all the sick gold and silver stuff, plus all the cool treasures he found in the house of the LORD and the king's crib. And not gonna lie, he also grabbed some hostages on the way back to Samaria. 15. Yo, check out all the things Jehoash did, yo. He was straight up powerful, and he totally went against Amaziah, the king of Judah. Like, you gotta read all about it in the book that talks about the kings of Israel, y'know? 16. And Jehoash passed away, and he was laid to rest in Samaria alongside the other kings of Israel. After him, his son Jeroboam became the new ruler. 17. And Amaziah, the son of Joash, the ruler of Judah, survived for fifteen years after the passing of Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, the ruler of Israel. 18. And, like, if you wanna know more about what Amaziah did, it's all in this like super cool book called the chronicles of the kings of Judah, you know? 19. So, like, there was this whole plot against him in Jerusalem, and then he had to dip out to Lachish. But, damn, they actually chased after him to Lachish and straight up took him out there. 20. And they carried him on horses, and he was laid to rest in Jerusalem with his ancestors in the city of David. 21. So, like, all the peeps in Judah were like, 'Yo, let's choose Azariah, who was just 16, to be our king after his dad Amaziah.' (BTW, Azariah was also known as Uzziah, ya know?) 22. He built Elath and gave it back to Judah, after the king passed away. 23. So, like, in the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Joash, who was king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joash, took over as the king of Israel in Samaria. And he ruled for, like, forty-one years. 24. And he totally messed up in front of the LORD: he didn't stop doing all the messed up things that Jeroboam, Nebat's son, did, which made Israel go astray. 25. He made Israel all awesome again, from Hamath to the chillin' plain by the sea, just like the LORD God of Israel said through his homie Jonah, son of Amittai, the legit prophet from Gathhepher. 26. Yo, the big man upstairs peeped the struggle of Israel, like, it was mad intense. No lie, ain't nobody safe, nobody left, and nobody to lend a hand to Israel. 27. And God didn't even mention wiping out Israel from existence. Instead, he rescued them with the help of Jeroboam, the son of Joash. 28. So, like, there's more stuff that Jeroboam did, and it was legit impressive. He straight up took over Damascus and Hamath, which were originally part of Judah but became part of Israel. You can find all the deets written in the book that's all about the kings of Israel, yo. 29. And Jeroboam passed away, joining his ancestors, the kings of Israel. Then his son Zachariah took over as the new ruler. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 141. In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah. 2. He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 3. And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did. 4. Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places. 5. And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father. 6. But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin. 7. He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day. {Selah: or, the rock} 8. Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face. 9. And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that {was} in Lebanon sent to the cedar that {was} in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that {was} in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle. 10. Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory {of this}, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to {thy} hurt, that thou shouldest fall, {even} thou, and Judah with thee? {at home: Heb. at thy house} 11. But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which {belongeth} to Judah. 12. And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents. {put...: Heb. smitten} 13. And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 14. And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria. 15. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 16. And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead. 17. And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 18. And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 19. Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there. 20. And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David. 21. And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which {was} sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. {Azariah: also called, Uzziah} 22. He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. 23. In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, {and reigned} forty and one years. 24. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 25. He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which {was} of Gathhepher. 26. For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, {that it was} very bitter: for {there was} not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel. 27. And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. 28. Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, {which belonged} to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 29. And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, {even} with the kings of Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 151. In the 27th year of Jeroboam's rule as king of Israel, Azariah (aka Uzziah) son of Amaziah became the boss of Judah. 2. He was just 16 when he became king, and he ruled over Jerusalem for a solid 52 years. His mom, Jecholiah from Jerusalem, had his back. 3. And he did what was lit in God's eyes, just like his OG dad Amaziah. 4. But they didn't get rid of the high spots tho: peeps kept sacrificing and burning incense up there like before. 5. And God messed up the king so bad that he got leprosy until he died and had to live in a separate house. And Jotham, the king's son, took charge and started making fair decisions for the people of the land. 6. And yo, all the other stuff Azariah did, like, isn't it all written in that book called 'Chronicles of the Kings of Judah' or something? 7. So Azariah passed away and was laid to rest with his ancestors in the city of David. Jotham, his son, took over as ruler in his place. 8. In the 38th year that Azariah was ruling Judah, Zachariah, son of Jeroboam, stepped up to take charge of Israel in Samaria, but only lasted for a short six months. 9. And, like his dads before him, he totally messed up in God's eyes. He didn't even try to stop committing the same sins as Jeroboam, the guy who messed up Israel. 10. Then Shallum, Jabesh's son, plotted against him and attacked him in front of everyone. He killed him and took over his position as ruler. 11. So, basically, if you want to know more about what went down with Zachariah, you gotta check out the book called 'The Chronicles of the Kings of Israel'. It's got all the juicy details you're looking for! 12. This is what God told Jehu: Your kids will rule over Israel for four generations. And guess what? It totally happened. 13. Shallum, Jabesh's son, took over as king when Uzziah of Judah had been ruling for 39 years. Shallum held the throne in Samaria for a solid month. 14. So Menahem, Gadi's son, left Tirzah and went to Samaria. He defeated and killed Shallum, Jabesh's son, in Samaria, taking over as ruler. 15. So, like, all the other stuff that Shallum pulled off, with his whole scheming thing, it's, like, totally recorded in that book of stories about the kings of Israel, you know? 16. So, Menahem totally wrecked Tiphsah and everyone there, along with the surrounding areas from Tirzah. Why, you ask? Well, they refused to let him in, so he's like, 'Fine, I'm gonna take 'em down!' And not only that, he even went as far as to harm all the pregnant women in there. Yeah, pretty brutal, I know. 17. In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah ruling over Judah, Menahem, Gadi's son, took charge of Israel and was king in Samaria for a solid decade. 18. And he, like, totally messed up in the eyes of the LORD, ya know? He never stopped committing the same old sins as Jeroboam, who got all of Israel into sinning mode. 19. So there was this king named Pul from Assyria who rolled up on our turf. And Menahem, being the smart guy he is, gave Pul a ton of cash - like a thousand talents of silver, no biggie - so they could be bros and Pul could help Menahem secure his kingdom. #FriendshipGoals 20. Menahem collected money from all the rich and powerful people in Israel, making each person give fifty shekels of silver to the king of Assyria. As a result, the king of Assyria went back and didn't stay in the land anymore. 21. Yo, are all the other dope things Menahem did not mentioned in the sick book of the kings of Israel? 22. And Menahem passed away, and his son Pekahiah took over as king. 23. In the 50th year of Azariah ruling over Judah, Pekahiah, Menahem's son, started being in charge of Israel in Samaria, and he ruled for two years. 24. And he did some really messed up stuff that made God really, really angry. He just couldn't stop being sinful, just like Jeroboam, who taught Israel to do all kinds of bad things. 25. Yo, so Pekah, the son of Remaliah, one of his top dudes, straight up plotted against him and took him down in Samaria, right in the crib of the king's pad. He had Argob, Arieh, and fifty other Gileadites roll with him, and they straight up killed him. Then Pekah took over and ruled in his place, no cap. 26. So, like, there's more stuff about Pekahiah and everything he did, you know? It's all written down in the book that tells the stories of the kings of Israel, yo. 27. So, like, in the 52nd year of Azariah, the king of Judah, this dude Pekah, son of Remaliah, totally started ruling over Israel in Samaria. He held onto that power for twenty whole years, man. 28. And like, he totally did things that were not cool in the eyes of the LORD, ya know? He was all about keeping up those sinful ways of Jeroboam, Nebat's son, who led Israel astray. 29. Back in the day when Pekah was ruling Israel, Tiglathpileser, the king of Assyria, rolled in and straight up snatched Ijon, Abelbethmaachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, basically all of Naphtali's turf, and dragged them off as captives to Assyria. 30. So Hoshea, Elah's son, plotted against Pekah, Remaliah's son, and totally took him out, becoming the new ruler instead in the year Jotham, Uzziah's son, turned twenty. 31. Yo, there's more to Pekah's story, like all the stuff he did, but you gotta check out the book of the kings of Israel for all the deets. 32. In the second year when Pekah, Remaliah's son, was ruling over Israel, Jotham, Uzziah's son, took the crown as king of Judah. 33. He became king when he was 25 years old and ruled Jerusalem for 16 years. His mom's name was Jerusha, and she was Zadok's daughter. 34. Dude, he totally did what was righteous in the eyes of the LORD. Like, he followed in the footsteps of his father Uzziah and did everything just like him. 35. But, like, even though they knew they shouldn't, the people kept doing their thing at the high places, you know? They were sacrificing and burning incense there, totally ignoring the rules. Oh, and just to add, dude also built this super cool gate, like, way higher up, at the house of the LORD. Pretty impressive, fam. 36. Yo, if you wanna know more about Jotham and everything he did, just check out the chronicles of the kings of Judah. It's all written down there, fam. 37. Back in the day, the LORD decided to bring some trouble to Judah by sending Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah. 38. And Jotham passed away and was laid to rest in the city of David, alongside his ancestors. Afterward, his son Ahaz took over as the ruler. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 151. In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign. {Azariah: also called, Uzziah} 2. Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Jecholiah of Jerusalem. 3. And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done; 4. Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places. 5. And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king's son {was} over the house, judging the people of the land. 6. And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 7. So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead. 8. In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six months. 9. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 10. And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. 11. And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they {are} written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 12. This {was} the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth {generation}. And so it came to pass. 13. Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria. {Uzziah: Gr. Ozias} {a full...: Heb. a month of days} 14. For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. 15. And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they {are} written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 16. Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that {were} therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not {to him}, therefore he smote {it; and} all the women therein that were with child he ripped up. 17. In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, {and reigned} ten years in Samaria. 18. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 19. {And} Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. 20. And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, {even} of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in the land. {exacted: Heb. caused to come forth} 21. And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 22. And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead. 23. In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} two years. 24. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 25. But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room. 26. And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they {are} written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 27. In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, {and reigned} twenty years. 28. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. 29. In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria. 30. And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 31. And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they {are} written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel. 32. In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign. 33. Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok. 34. And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done. 35. Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD. 36. Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 37. In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah. 38. And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 161. In like the 17th year of Pekah, Remaliah's kid, Ahaz - Jotham's offspring - took over as king of Judah. 2. Ahaz was, like, totally 20 when he became king and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. But, like, he didn't do what God wanted him to do, you know? He didn't follow God's rules, just like his dad David did. 3. But he totally followed the kings of Israel and even made his son go through some messed up rituals, like the disgusting stuff the other nations were into, and God was like, 'Nah, I'm kicking them out of Israel.' 4. And he was like, totally offering sacrifices and burning incense everywhere, on like high places, hills, and even under each and every green tree! 5. So, Rezin, the king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, decided to attack Jerusalem, but they couldn't defeat Ahaz, even though they had surrounded the city. 6. Back in the day, Rezin, the king of Syria, took back Elath and kicked out the Jews. The Syrians moved in and still live there to this day. {from Elath: in Hebrew, from Eloth} 7. So Ahaz hit up Tiglathpileser, the king of Assyria, with a DM like, 'Hey, I'm totally down to be your loyal follower and homie. Can you slide through and save me from these haters? The kings of Syria and Israel are all up in my face.' 8. So Ahaz straight up took the cash from both the Lord's crib and the king's stash and sent it as a gift to the king of Assyria. 9. So the king of Assyria listened to him and went up against Damascus, captured it, took its people to Kir as captives, and killed Rezin. (Damascus was also known as Dammesek) 10. So King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser, the king of Assyria, and he noticed an altar in Damascus. King Ahaz then sent a message to Urijah the priest, describing the design and all the details of the altar. 11. So this priest named Urijah totally built an altar, just like King Ahaz had instructed him all the way from Damascus, you know? And Urijah, being the priest that he is, set up the altar before King Ahaz even arrived from Damascus. 12. And when the king got back from Damascus, he noticed the altar. So, he went up to it and made an offering there. 13. And he lit up his burnt offering and his food offering, and poured out his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings on the altar. {the peace offerings which were his: in Hebrew, the peace offerings that belonged to him} 14. So he moved the bronze altar that was in front of the LORD, from the very front of the temple, between the altar and the house of the LORD, and placed it on the north side of the altar. 15. Yo, King Ahaz told Urijah the priest to go ahead and burn the morning burnt offering, the evening meat offering, the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering on the huge altar. Oh, and don't forget to include the burnt offerings, meat offerings, and drink offerings from all the people in the land. Then, sprinkle all the blood from the burnt offering and sacrifice on that brass altar. By the way, that altar is solely for my needs and inquiries. 16. So Urijah the priest did everything that king Ahaz commanded him to do. 17. Yo, King Ahaz straight up removed the edges of these bases and took away the water basin from them. He also took down the huge sea thing from the bronze oxen underneath it, and placed it on a stone floor. 18. So, the chill hangout spot they made in the house for the Sabbath, and the cool outdoor entrance for the king, he decided to get rid of because of the king of Assyria. 19. So, like, all the other stuff that Ahaz did, isn't it all, like, written down in that book called 'The Chronicles of the Kings of Judah' or what? 20. And Ahaz passed away, joining his ancestors, and was laid to rest in the city of David. Then Hezekiah, his son, took his place as the new ruler. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 161. In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign. 2. Twenty years old {was} Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father. 3. But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel. 4. And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. 5. Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome {him}. 6. At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto this day. {from Elath: Heb. from Eloth} 7. So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I {am} thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me. 8. And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent {it for} a present to the king of Assyria. 9. And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried {the people of} it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin. {Damascus: Heb. Dammesek} 10. And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that {was} at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof. {Damascus: Heb. Dammesek} 11. And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made {it} against king Ahaz came from Damascus. 12. And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon. 13. And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon the altar. {his peace offerings: Heb. the peace offerings which were his} 14. And he brought also the brasen altar, which {was} before the LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar. 15. And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire {by}. 16. Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz commanded. 17. And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that {were} under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones. 18. And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for the king of Assyria. 19. Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 20. And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 171. So, like, in the twelfth year of Ahaz's reign as king of Judah, this dude named Hoshea, Elah's son, started being the ruler of Israel in Samaria. He held the position for, like, nine years, you know? 2. And he, like, totally did things that were so not cool in the eyes of the LORD, but hey, he wasn't as bad as the previous kings of Israel, you know? 3. Then Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria, came against him, and Hoshea became his servant and gave him some gifts. (The word 'gave' means 'rendered' here and 'presents' can also mean 'tribute'.) 4. So, like, the king of Assyria totally caught Hoshea trying to plot against him. Turns out, Hoshea had sent messengers to this So dude, king of Egypt, without bringing any gifts to the king of Assyria, like he used to do every year. That's why the king of Assyria was like, 'Nah, no way!' and he locked Hoshea up in prison. #toughluck 5. So like, the king of Assyria rolled through the whole land and headed to Samaria, and he straight up surrounded it for three years. 6. In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria totally clapped Samaria and flexed on Israel by dragging them to Assyria. He yeeted them to places like Halah and Habor by the river of Gozan, as well as the cities of the Medes. 7. Yo, it went down like this: the Israelites straight up messed up and got on the wrong side of the LORD, their God, who hooked them up by getting them out of Egypt, breaking free from Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and suddenly they were all about worshipping other gods and stuff. 8. And they started following the same rules as those non-believers that God kicked out before the Israelites, and the rules set by the kings of Israel that they themselves created. 9. So the Israelites started doing some shady stuff that totally wasn't cool with the LORD their God. They straight up built these fancy spots in all their cities, from the lookout tower to the fortified city walls. 10. And they, like, totally put up these statues and groves on every high hill and under every cool tree, you know. #artistry #nature 11. And they were burning incense at all the cool spots, just like those non-believers that the LORD sent away earlier, and doing all kinds of messed up stuff to make the LORD really mad: 12. They were all about worshipping idols, even though the LORD had straight up told them not to do that. 13. But God totally called out Israel and Judah through all the prophets and seers. He was like, 'Yo, stop doing messed up stuff and start following my rules and laws, just like your ancestors did. I sent you messages through my prophet squad, so you better listen up.' 14. But they were stubborn and refused to listen, just like their ancestors who didn't trust in the LORD their God. 15. But they totally dissed his rules and the agreement he made with their ancestors, and even ignored all his warnings. Instead, they started chasing after useless things and ended up being totally empty. They ditched their own God and started imitating the people around them, even though God had specifically told them not to. 16. And, like, they totally ditched all the rules from the LORD their God and decided to make these, like, trendy metal statues, you know, two calves. Oh, and they also made this chill hangout spot in the woods and started worshiping all the cool celestial beings and serving this dude named Baal. 17. They like, totally made their kids go through fire, and got all into divination and enchantments, and like, straight up sold themselves out to do bad stuff that made the LORD hella mad. 18. So, like, the LORD was seriously ticked off at Israel, and totally banished them from his presence. It was like, only the tribe of Judah that survived, y'know? 19. So, like, Judah totally didn't follow the commandments of the LORD their God. They were all about doing their own thing and going along with the rules that the people of Israel made for themselves. 20. Yo, the LORD straight up rejected all the descendants of Israel. He gave them a tough time, let them face some real spoilers, until he straight up pushed them out of his sight. 21. Because he split Israel away from David's dynasty; and they made Jeroboam, Nebat's son, their king: and Jeroboam led Israel astray from following the LORD, causing them to commit a major sin. 22. The Israelite squad really went all in on the sinful actions of Jeroboam, like no turning back, totally sticking with it. 23. So, like, the LORD followed through on what He said through all the prophets and stuff and made Israel peace out of His sight. And now, Israel got deported from their homeland to Assyria, and it's been like that up until now. 24. So, the Assyrian king brought in some peeps from Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and Sepharvaim, and settled them in the cities of Samaria, kicking out the Israelite kids. They took over Samaria and made it their new crib. 25. So, like, when they first started living there, they totally didn't respect the LORD, you know? So, the LORD decided to send a bunch of lions to attack them, and, like, some people got killed and stuff. 26. So, they went up to the Assyrian king and were like, 'Yo, the peeps you relocated to the cities of Samaria don't know squat about the God of the land. That's why there are lions attacking and straight up wrecking them, 'cause they don't know how to act around the God of the land. 27. So the ruler of Assyria was like, 'Yo, grab one of those priests you took from there and send them over to live there and teach the people about how the God of that land rolls.' 28. So, like, this priest that got taken from Samaria ended up chilling in Bethel, and he's, like, teaching the people there how to respect the LORD, you know? 29. But like, every nation was like, into making their own gods, you know? And they would totally place them in these fancy high places that the Samaritans built, like in every city where they lived. 30. So, like, the guys from Babylon were all about this thing called Succothbenoth, and the dudes from Cuth were into Nergal, and the guys from Hamath were all about Ashima. 31. So, the Avites were totally into creating Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites took things to a whole new level by literally sacrificing their own children in a fiery blaze to worship Adrammelech and Anammelech, who they believed were the supreme gods of Sepharvaim. 32. So like, they were totally in awe of the LORD, and then they went and chose some random peeps from the bottom of the barrel to be their priests at the fancy worship spots. These priests were the ones sacrificing for them in those bougie high-rise houses of worship. 33. They were shook by the LORD, but also did their own thing by following the trends of the nations they were taken captive by. {who carried them away from thence} 34. Even until now, they still do things the old-fashioned way. They don't really care about God, and they don't follow the rules, regulations, laws, and commandments that God gave to the people of Jacob, also known as Israel. 35. God made a deal with these people and told them, 'Don't be scared of other gods, don't bow down to them, don't be their servants, and definitely don't offer sacrifices to them.' 36. But the LORD, who flexed His immense power and rescued you from Egypt, is the one you should respect, worship, and make offerings to. 37. So, like, all those rules, guidelines, laws, and commands that he put down for you? Yeah, you gotta follow them forever, and definitely don't start worshiping any other gods, okay? 38. Yo, don't forget about the deal I made with you and don't be trippin' over other gods. 39. You gotta have mad respect for the LORD your God, 'cause He'll straight up save you from all your enemies. 40. But they didn't listen, they just kept doing what they always did. 41. So like, these nations legit had like, mad respect for God and stuff, but they also worshipped these whack statues and passed down this whole messed up worship thing to their kids and grandkids. It's like a tradition that's still going on today, just like their ancestors used to do. Man, talk about stuck in the past. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 171. In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years. 2. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him. 3. Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents. {gave: Heb. rendered} {presents: or, tribute} 4. And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as {he had done} year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison. {present: or, tribute} 5. Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. 6. In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor {by} the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. 7. For {so} it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods, 8. And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made. 9. And the children of Israel did secretly {those} things that {were} not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. 10. And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree: {images: Heb. statues} 11. And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as {did} the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger: 12. For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing. 13. Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, {and by} all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments {and} my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets. {by: Heb. by the hand of} 14. Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God. 15. And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that {were} round about them, {concerning} whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them. 16. And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, {even} two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal. 17. And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 18. Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only. 19. Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made. 20. And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight. 21. For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin. 22. For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them; 23. Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day. 24. And the king of Assyria brought {men} from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed {them} in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof. 25. And {so} it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, {that} they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew {some} of them. 26. Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land. 27. Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land. 28. Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD. 29. Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put {them} in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt. 30. And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 31. And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 32. So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places. 33. They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence. {whom...: or, who carried them away from thence} 34. Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel; 35. With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them: 36. But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice. 37. And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods. 38. And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods. 39. But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies. 40. Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner. 41. So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 181. In the year three of Hoshea, son of Elah, reigning as king of Israel, Hezekiah, son of Ahaz, took over as the ruler of Judah. You may also know Hezekiah as Ezekias. 2. He was 25 years old when he started being in charge, and he ruled over Jerusalem for 29 years. His mom's name was Abi, and she was the daughter of Zachariah. (Abi was also known as Abijah!) 3. And he did what was lit in God's eyes, just like how his dad David did it. 4. He totally got rid of all the cool spots where people were worshiping idols, smashed all the statues, chopped down those nature shrines, and completely destroyed that bronze snake Moses had made. You won't believe it, but back then, the Israelites used to light incense and worship it like it was some kind of divine object. He even gave it a mocking name - Nehushtan, which basically means a useless piece of metal. 5. He had mad trust in the LORD God of Israel; like, no cap, no other king in Judah could even come close to him, not even the ones before him. 6. Because he stayed loyal to the LORD and never stopped following Him. He made it a point to obey all the commandments that the LORD gave to Moses. 7. And God was always there for him; he succeeded wherever he went, and he refused to obey the king of Assyria and didn't serve him. 8. He totally owned the Philistines, like all the way to Gaza, and their whole territory, from the watchtower to the fortified city. (Gaza means Azzah in Hebrew, by the way) 9. So, like, in the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was in the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah, who was king of Israel, Shalmaneser, who was the king of Assyria, came and attacked Samaria, putting it under siege. 10. After three years, they finally conquered it - in the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign, which was also the ninth year of Hoshea's rule over Israel. That's when Samaria fell. 11. So like, the king of Assyria took the whole nation of Israel to Assyria and made them live in places called Halah and Habor, which are like near the Gozan river, you know? And there were also some Israelites living in the cities of the Medes, FYI. 12. Yo, they straight up didn't listen to the voice of the LORD, didn't keep His covenant, and totally ignored all the commands of Moses, who was like God's right-hand man. They just couldn't be bothered to listen or follow through. 13. So like, in the 14th year that King Hezekiah was ruling, this dude named Sennacherib, who was the king of Assyria, decided to attack all the fortified cities of Judah and actually managed to conquer them. (Sennacherib means Sanherib in Hebrew, just FYI!) 14. So Hezekiah, the king of Judah, reached out to the king of Assyria in Lachish and humbly admitted his wrongdoing. He asked the king to forgive him and promised to take responsibility for any consequences. In response, the king of Assyria demanded from Hezekiah a hefty amount of silver - three hundred talents - and gold - thirty talents. 15. So Hezekiah hooked him up with all the cash he found in the crib of the LORD and the king's stash. 16. Back then, Hezekiah straight up took the gold from the doors of the temple of the LORD, and the ones he used to fancy up the pillars, and handed it all over to the king of Assyria. Can you believe it? 17. So, like, the king of Assyria, he like totally sent Tartan, Rabsaris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with this massive army, you know? And they like went all the way to Jerusalem, and once they got there, they stood by the conduit of the upper pool, the one that's located on the highway of the fuller's field. It's, like, a major deal, you know?! 18. So they called for the king, and Eliakim, Hilkiah's son who was in charge of the household, along with Shebna the scribe and Joah, Asaph's son, who was the recorder, came out to meet them. 19. So Rabshakeh was like, 'Yo, talk to Hezekiah and tell him this: The big shot king of Assyria wants to know what gives him so much confidence.' 20. You're just talking nonsense when you say you have a plan and power for the battle. Who do you think you can rely on that you're rebelling against me? 21. Yo, check it out, you're relying on a weak af stick - Egypt, bro. If you lean on it, it's gonna break and stab you. That's exactly what Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is like for anyone who puts their trust in him. #notworthit #unreliable 22. But like, if you're telling me, 'Yo, we're all about trusting in the LORD our God,' isn't it true that Hezekiah straight up got rid of those fancy worship spots and altars? And now he's saying that we gotta worship at this altar in Jerusalem? 23. Okay, listen up. Here's the deal: Get ready, 'cause I'm about to offer you a sweet deal. Just give some guarantees to my main man, the king of Assyria, and in return, I'll hook you up with two thousand horses. Of course, you gotta prove you can handle them by actually putting riders on 'em. Deal or no deal? 24. Like, how do you plan to impress even the lowest-ranking officer of my master, and rely on Egypt for chariots and horsemen? 25. Did I just roll up here without the LORD to wreck this place? The LORD straight up told me, 'Yo, go and take down this land.' 26. So Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, Shebna, and Joah said to Rabshakeh, 'Dude, could you, like, speak in Syrian so that we can actually understand you? Don't use Hebrew to talk to us in front of these peeps on the wall.' 27. Yo, Rabshakeh was like, did my boss send me to your boss and you just to say this? Nah, he sent me to the dudes chillin' on the wall, so they can munch on their own crap and chug their own pee with you. Yeah, you heard me right, their own pee aka the water they wash their feet with. 28. So, like, Rabshakeh straight up stood there and started shouting in the Jews' language, and he was like, 'Listen up, ya'll! Get ready to hear the word from the real deal great king, the king of Assyria!' 29. Listen up, fam! The king says, don't be fooled by Hezekiah. He won't be able to save you from his grasp. 30. Don't let Hezekiah talk you into putting all your faith in the LORD, claiming that the LORD will totally save us and that this city won't fall into the hands of the king of Assyria. 31. Don't listen to Hezekiah, 'cause this is what the king of Assyria says: hang out with me, bring some cool stuff, and then we can all enjoy our own fruit and drink water from our own fancy wells. Let's make it all good, my peeps! 32. Yo, listen up! I got some good news for y'all. Imma come through and bring you to a dope land, just like where you from. It's gonna have all the good stuff - corn and wine, bread and vineyards, olive oil and honey. You'll be livin' it up, no dying allowed. Oh, and don't fall for Hezekiah tryna convince you that the LORD gonna save us. Don't believe the hype. Trust me on this one! 33. Have any of the gods of other nations actually saved their land from the king of Assyria? 34. Yo, what happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are those gods from Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? Did they save Samaria from my power? 35. Like, seriously, which of those so-called gods of other nations even stand a chance? Like, have any of them ever saved their people from me? So, why should the LORD save Jerusalem from me? 36. But the people were all like, totally silent and didn't say anything to him. 'Cause the king was all like, 'Don't answer him, fam.' 37. So, Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, who was in charge of the household, along with Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son, the recorder, went to Hezekiah. They were wearing torn clothes and shared the words of Rabshakeh with him. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 181. Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, {that} Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign. {Hezekiah: he is called Ezekias} 2. Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Abi, the daughter of Zachariah. {Abi: also called, Abijah} 3. And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did. 4. He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan. {images: Heb. statues} {Nehushtan: that is, A piece of brass} 5. He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor {any} that were before him. 6. For he clave to the LORD, {and} departed not from following him, but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses. {from...: Heb. from after him} 7. And the LORD was with him; {and} he prospered whithersoever he went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not. 8. He smote the Philistines, {even} unto Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. {Gaza: Heb. Azzah} 9. And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which {was} the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, {that} Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged it. 10. And at the end of three years they took it: {even} in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that {is} the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria was taken. 11. And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and put them in Halah and in Habor {by} the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes: 12. Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, {and} all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear {them}, nor do {them}. 13. Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them. {Sennacherib: Heb. Sanherib} 14. And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold. 15. And Hezekiah gave {him} all the silver that was found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house. 16. At that time did Hezekiah cut off {the gold from} the doors of the temple of the LORD, and {from} the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria. {it: Heb. them} 17. And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which {is} in the highway of the fuller's field. {great: Heb. heavy} 18. And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which {was} over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder. {scribe: or, secretary} 19. And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence {is} this wherein thou trustest? 20. Thou sayest, (but {they are but} vain words,) {I have} counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? {sayest: or, talkest} {vain...: Heb. word of the lips} {I have...: or, but counsel and strength are for the war} 21. Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, {even} upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so {is} Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him. {trustest: Heb. trustest thee} 22. But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: {is} not that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem? 23. Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them. {pledges: or, hostages} 24. How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 25. Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it. 26. Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah, unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand {it}: and talk not with us in the Jews' language in the ears of the people that {are} on the wall. 27. But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy master, and to thee, to speak these words? {hath he} not {sent me} to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you? {their own piss: Heb. the water of their feet} 28. Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria: 29. Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand: 30. Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 31. Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make {an agreement} with me by a present, and come out to me, and {then} eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern: {Make...: or, Seek my favour: Heb. Make with me a blessing} {cistern: or, pit} 32. Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us. {persuadeth: or, deceiveth} 33. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 34. Where {are} the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where {are} the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine hand? 35. Who {are} they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand? 36. But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not. 37. Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which {was} over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with {their} clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 191. So, when King Hezekiah heard about it, he was totally devastated. He freaked out, tore his clothes, threw on some humble sackcloth, and headed straight to the house of the LORD. 2. So he picked Eliakim, who was in charge, and Shebna the scribe, and the older priests, all wearing sackcloth, to go see Isaiah the prophet, Amoz's son. 3. And they were like, yo Hezekiah, listen up, today is straight up rough. We're dealing with troubles, criticism, and straight up disrespect. It's like giving birth, but lacking the strength to actually bring it forth. It's legit provoking, man. 4. God might just listen to what that guy Rabshakeh is saying, you know, the one the Assyrian king sent to disrespect the one true God. And when God hears it, He'll definitely call him out on it. So, you better pray for the few who are still hanging on. (Remnant means like, those who were found or something.) 5. So King Hezekiah's squad rolled up to Isaiah's crib. 6. Isaiah was like, yo guys, here's what you gotta tell your boss: listen up, the Lord says, don't freak out about all the trash talk you heard from those Assyrian king's servants dissing me. 7. Yo, listen up! I'm about to send a major attack his way, and he's gonna catch wind of some juicy gossip that'll make him turn right back to where he came from. And you know what? I'm gonna make sure he gets taken down in his own turf, beaten by the sword. 8. So Rabshakeh went back and saw that the king of Assyria was battling against Libnah, because he heard that the king had left Lachish. 9. So, when he heard that Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia, was coming to fight against you, he sent messengers to Hezekiah once again, like, 10. Yo, tell Hezekiah, the king of Judah, that he shouldn't let his trust in God fool him into thinking that Jerusalem won't be handed over to the king of Assyria. 11. Listen up, you've seen how the kings of Assyria straight up wrecked all those lands. Think you're gonna be spared? 12. Did those gods of other nations even save them from being annihilated as my ancestors annihilated cities like Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden in Thelasar? 13. Yo, what happened to the kings of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah tho? 14. So Hezekiah got the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went into the house of the LORD and laid it out in front of Him. 15. And Hezekiah was like, yo God, the only one and true God of Israel, who's chilling between the cherubims, you're the absolute boss, no one else compares, ruling all the kingdoms on this earth. You're the one who created the whole heaven and earth. 16. Yo, God, like, listen up and pay attention: open your eyes and witness what Sennacherib is saying to dishonor you, the mighty living God. 17. For real, God, the kings of Assyria straight up wrecked the nations and their lands, 18. And they totally yeeted their fake gods into the fire, 'cause let's be real, those things were just made by some dudes using basic materials like wood and stone. So obvi they totally wrecked them. 19. Yo, God, listen up! I'm begging you, please rescue us from this guy's clutches, so that all the kingdoms on Earth can recognize that you're the one and only LORD God. 20. So Isaiah, son of Amoz, hit up Hezekiah with a message from the LORD God of Israel. The deal is, He heard your prayer about Sennacherib, the king of Assyria. 21. Yo, this is what the LORD said about this dude: The virgin, daughter of Zion, straight up dissed you and laughed at you; the daughter of Jerusalem even shook her head in disappointment. 22. Who have you dissed and disrespected? And who have you mocked and talked trash about? Against whom have you tried so hard to be loud and tried to act all high and mighty? Yep, against the Holy One of Israel. 23. You really dissed the Lord with your messengers, boasting about how your fleet of fancy chariots conquered mountains and chopped down all those majestic cedar and fir trees. You even bragged about invading the borders and infiltrating the lush forest. #BoldMoves #NatureConqueror 24. I've explored and sipped on some seriously bizarre drinks, and I've totally drained all the rivers in heavily protected areas with the soles of my shoes. {besieged: or, fenced} 25. Yo, didn't you know way back when I totally did this? Like, I've been planning and setting it up since ancient times. And now, watch me make it happen: those fortified cities are gonna crumble into total ruins. Bet you didn't see that coming, huh? 26. So like, the people living there were pretty weak and totally freaked out. They were like, so fragile and easily crushed, just like grass in a field or green plants on a rooftop. It's like they couldn't even grow up properly, getting destroyed just as they started. They seriously lacked power and strength. 27. But I know where you chill, where you roll out, where you show up, and how you get all mad at me. #notsosecret 28. Since you're out here getting all mad and causing a scene, I heard it loud and clear. So guess what? I'm gonna put a little something in your nose and a bit in your mouth to control ya. And you know what else? I'm gonna make you go back the same way you came from. Bam! 29. And here's how you know: You gotta feast on the self-grown goods this year, then the next year munch on what's sprouting up naturally. But in the third year, you gotta put efforts into planting, harvesting, and growing vineyards, and indulge in the sweet fruits of your labor. 30. Yo, the small crew that managed to survive from the house of Judah will get their roots deep down and start producing mad fruit in no time. #Survivors #Growth 31. Yo, listen up! There will be a group of peeps coming outta Jerusalem, and some survivors from Mount Zion too. It's all gonna go down because the Lord is super pumped about it. Trust me, it's gonna happen! 32. So basically, God's saying that the king of Assyria ain't gonna get anywhere near this city. Like, no chance. He won't even shoot an arrow at it, or show up with his shield, or try to set up camp. This city is off-limits to him, no doubt. 33. Just like the way he rolled in, that's how he gonna roll back out. Ain't gonna step foot in this city, says the LORD. 34. I got your back, fam! Gonna protect this city, just to save it. Doing it for my own sake and for the sake of my homeboy, David. 35. So, like, during the night, the angel of the LORD went out and totally wrecked the Assyrians in their camp, wiping out like 185,000 of them! And when morning came, bam, there was just a bunch of dead bodies lying around. 36. And like, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, just bounced, went back to his crib in Nineveh. 37. So, while he was busy vibing and worshipping in the house of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, straight up attacked him with a sword. Then, they dipped and escaped to Armenia. And yo, his son Esarhaddon took over as the new ruler. (Ararat, you know, that's what Armenia used to be called, just a lil' FYI) \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 191. And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard {it}, that he rent his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the LORD. 2. And he sent Eliakim, which {was} over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz. 3. And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day {is} a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and {there is} not strength to bring forth. {blasphemy: or, provocation} 4. It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up {thy} prayer for the remnant that are left. {left: Heb. found} 5. So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 6. And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. 7. Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. 8. So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 9. And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying, 10. Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria. 11. Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be delivered? 12. Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; {as} Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which {were} in Thelasar? 13. Where {is} the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah? 14. And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD. 15. And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of Israel, which dwellest {between} the cherubims, thou art the God, {even} thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou hast made heaven and earth. 16. LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent him to reproach the living God. 17. Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands, 18. And have cast their gods into the fire: for they {were} no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed them. {cast: Heb. given} 19. Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou {art} the LORD God, {even} thou only. 20. Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, {That} which thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard. 21. This {is} the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, {and} laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. 22. Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted {thy} voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? {even} against the Holy {One} of Israel. 23. By thy messengers thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof, {and} the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders, {and into} the forest of his Carmel. {By: Heb. By the hand of} {tall...: Heb. tallness, etc} {of his Carmel: or, and his fruitful field} 24. I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places. {besieged: or, fenced} 25. Hast thou not heard long ago {how} I have done it, {and} of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities {into} ruinous heaps. {long...: or, how I have made it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? should I now bring it to be laid waste, and fenced cities to be ruinous heaps?} 26. Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were {as} the grass of the field, and {as} the green herb, {as} the grass on the housetops, and {as corn} blasted before it be grown up. {of small...: Heb. short of hand} 27. But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. {abode: or, sitting} 28. Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. 29. And this {shall be} a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof. 30. And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward. {remnant...: Heb. escaping of the house of Judah that remaineth} 31. For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD {of hosts} shall do this. {they...: Heb. the escaping} 32. Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it. 33. By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith the LORD. 34. For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. 35. And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they {were} all dead corpses. 36. So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh. 37. And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. {Armenia: Heb. Ararat} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 201. Back in those days, Hezekiah was seriously ill, almost on the verge of death. Then Isaiah, the prophet and son of Amoz, paid him a visit. Isaiah straight up told him, 'Yo, the Big Man upstairs has a message for you: Get your house in order because you're about to kick the bucket.' 2. So he whipped out his phone, flipped the camera to selfie mode, and DM'd the LORD, like, 3. Yo, God, please remember how I've been real and genuine in my actions, staying true to my heart and doing what's right in your eyes. Hezekiah straight up cried his heart out, like, a lot. 4. So, like, Isaiah hadn't even left the middle court yet, when the word of the LORD came to him, saying... 5. Get back to Hezekiah, the leader of my peeps, and tell him this from the LORD, the God of his pops David: I listened to your prayer, I saw those tears drop. Check it, I'm gonna bring the healing your way, and in just three days, you'll bounce back and head over to the crib of the LORD. 6. I'm gonna hook you up with 15 more years, save you and this city from the Assyrian king, and protect this place for myself and because of my homeboy David. 7. So Isaiah was like, 'Yo, grab those figs.' And they did, and put it on the boil, and the dude got better. 8. And Hezekiah was like, yo Isaiah, can you gimme a sign that the LORD is gonna heal me? Like, I wanna know if I'll be able to go to the house of the LORD in three days or not. 9. So Isaiah was like, yo, here's how you'll know that the Lord is gonna do what He said: basically, you can choose if the shadow moves forward ten degrees or goes back ten degrees. 10. And Hezekiah was like, bruh, it ain't no big deal if the shadow goes down ten degrees, nah fam, but how about we make it go back ten degrees instead? 11. So Isaiah the prophet called out to the LORD and, like, the LORD made the shadow go back ten degrees on the dial of Ahaz, you know. (BTW, the Hebrew word for 'dial' means 'degrees'.) 12. Back in the day, Berodachbaladan, Baladan's son and the king of Babylon, slid into Hezekiah's DMs with a message and a gift. He heard that Hezekiah was dealing with some sickness. (BTW, Berodachbaladan is also known as Merodachbaladan.) 13. And Hezekiah listened to them, and showed them everything cool in his crib - the bling, the gold, the fragrances, the fancy perfume, and all the lit gear he had in his stash. He didn't hold back, showing them everything in his crib and his entire kingdom. Hezekiah flexed hard, making sure they saw every single thing he had. No cap! 14. So Isaiah the prophet showed up to King Hezekiah and asked him, 'Yo, what did those dudes say and where did they come from?' And Hezekiah was like, 'They came all the way from Babylon, man.' 15. And he was like, 'Dude, what did those people see in your house?' And Hezekiah was like, 'Bro, they saw everything that's in my house, no secrets here. I wasn't holding back, showed 'em all my treasures and stuff.' 16. And Isaiah was like, yo Hezekiah, check it out, I got a message from the big man upstairs. 17. Listen up, there's gonna be a time when everything in your crib and all the stuff your parents saved up will be hauled off to Babylon. The Lord's making it clear, there won't be anything left behind. 18. And, like, some of your kids who come after you, that you're gonna have, they're gonna be taken away and end up as eunuchs in the king of Babylon's crib. 19. Hezekiah said to Isaiah, 'That's a solid word from the LORD you just spoke. You know what, wouldn't it be awesome if peace and truth could reign during my time? Like, that would be legit!' 20. Yo, want to know more about Hezekiah? Dude was legit strong and did some awesome stuff, like building a sick pool and pipeline to bring water into the city. If you're curious about all the other cool things he did, you gotta check out the book of the kings of Judah, it's all written in there. 21. And Hezekiah passed away, joining his ancestors, and Manasseh, his son, assumed the throne in his place. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 201. In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live. {Set...: Heb. Give charge concerning thine house} 2. Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD, saying, 3. I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done {that which is} good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore. {sore: Heb. with a great weeping} 4. And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying, {court: or, city} 5. Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD. 6. And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake. 7. And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid {it} on the boil, and he recovered. 8. And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What {shall be} the sign that the LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of the LORD the third day? 9. And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees? 10. And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward ten degrees. 11. And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz. {dial: Heb. degrees} 12. At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick. {Berodachbaladan: or, Merodachbaladan} 13. And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and {all} the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them not. {precious things: or, spicery} {armour: or, jewels: Heb. vessels} 14. Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, {even} from Babylon. 15. And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All {the things} that {are} in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them. 16. And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD. 17. Behold, the days come, that all that {is} in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. 18. And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. 19. Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good {is} the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, {Is it} not {good}, if peace and truth be in my days? {Is it...: or, Shall there not be peace and truth, etc} 20. And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the city, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 21. And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son reigned in his stead. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 211. Manasseh was, like, 12 years old when he became king and he ruled for, like, 55 years in Jerusalem. His mom's name was Hephzibah, by the way. 2. And he, like, totally did bad stuff that disgusted the LORD, copying the messed up things the unbelievers were doing, you know, the ones the LORD kicked out before the Israelites. 3. So, this guy totally rebuilt those cool hilltop gathering spots that Hezekiah, his dad, had totally wrecked. Plus, he went all out and made these rad altars for Baal and even planted a grove, just like that Ahab, king of Israel, did back in the day. And get this, he actually worshiped all those celestial beings and did everything they asked! 4. And he, like, built these altars in the house of the LORD, you know. And the LORD was like, 'Yo, I'm totally gonna hook up my name in Jerusalem.' 5. And he, like, totally put up altars for all the cool celestial beings in both areas of the Lord's house. 6. And he made his son go through some intense stuff, practiced all kinds of mystical rituals, and got involved with spirits and spellcasters: he did a whole lot of evil that seriously ticked off the LORD. 7. So, he placed this cool statue of a grove that he made inside the house, just like the LORD told David and Solomon. This house in Jerusalem is pretty rad, it's the one the LORD picked out of all the tribes of Israel to put His name on forever! 8. I won't kick Israel out of the land I gave their ancestors anymore, just as long as they stay committed to following all the rules I've given them, just like my boy Moses told them to. 9. But they didn't listen: and Manasseh totally got them to do even more messed up stuff than the nations that got wiped out by the LORD before the Israelite peeps. 10. And God spoke through his prophets, saying, 11. Yo, Manasseh, the king of Judah, seriously messed up. Like, he did some seriously messed up things that were even worse than what the Amorites did before him. And because of his actions, he caused the people of Judah to also sin by worshipping idols. Like, it was not cool at all. 12. Yo, listen up! This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, is saying: Brace yourselves, 'cause I'm about to bring some serious trouble upon Jerusalem and Judah. It's gonna be so intense that when people hear about it, their ears will be tingling like crazy. 13. And I'm gonna bring some major judgment vibes to Jerusalem, just like what went down in Samaria and in the house of Ahab. Jerusalem is about to get wiped clean, like when you fully clean a dish, flipping it upside down and getting rid of any residue. Seriously, it's gonna be intense. 14. And I will totally ditch what's left of my people, and hand them over to their haters; they'll be totally taken advantage of and robbed by all their enemies; 15. Yo, they've been straight up doing evil stuff in front of me and getting me all mad, ever since their parents left Egypt till now. 16. Manasseh was super brutal and killed a ton of innocent peeps, like flooded Jerusalem all over with their blood. Plus, he got Judah all messed up and made them do all kinds of wicked stuff that made the big man upstairs really ticked off. 17. Yo, there's still more stuff that Manasseh did and all the wrong choices he made. You can find all the deets about it in the book that documents the history of the kings of Judah. 18. And Manasseh passed away, and he was laid to rest in his own backyard, in the garden of Uzza. Then his son Amon took over as king. 19. Amon was like 22 when he started being the boss in Jerusalem, and he ruled for about 2 years. His mom's name was Meshullemeth, and she was the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah. 20. And he was totally not vibing with the LORD, just like his dad Manasseh. 21. And he followed in the footsteps of his father, doing all the same things his dad did - serving the idols and worshiping them:  22. And he ditched the LORD God of his ancestors, and didn't follow the path the LORD laid out. 23. The squad of Amon's homies plotted against him and straight up took down the king in his own crib. 24. Then the squad of peeps took down all those who plotted against King Amon; and the crew made Josiah, his son, the new king in his place. 25. Yo, all the other stuff that Amon did, isn't it already written down in the book of the kings of Judah? 26. And they put him to rest in his fancy grave in the Uzza garden. Then Josiah, his son, took over as ruler. {Josiah: aka Josias} \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 211. Manasseh {was} twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Hephzibah. 2. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel. 3. For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 4. And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name. 5. And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. 6. And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke {him} to anger. 7. And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 8. Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them. 9. But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel. 10. And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, 11. Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations, {and} hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which {were} before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his idols: 12. Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I {am} bringing {such} evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. 13. And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as {a man} wipeth a dish, wiping {it}, and turning {it} upside down. {wiping...: Heb. he wipeth and turneth it upon the face thereof} 14. And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; 15. Because they have done {that which was} evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day. 16. Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD. {from...: Heb. from mouth to mouth} 17. Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 18. And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. 19. Amon {was} twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 20. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did. 21. And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: 22. And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD. 23. And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house. 24. And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. 25. Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 26. And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead. {Josiah: Gr. Josias} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 221. Josiah was just 8 when he started being in charge, and he ruled over Jerusalem for 31 years. His mom's name was Jedidah, and she was the daughter of Adaiah from Boscath. 2. He straight up did what the LORD thought was right and followed in his dad, David's, footsteps. He stayed on track without getting swayed to either side. 3. So, like, in the year when King Josiah was 18 and all, the king decided to send this dude named Shaphan to the house of the LORD. Shaphan was the son of Azaliah and the grandson of Meshullam, and he was a total pro at writing stuff down, you know? Anyway, the king was like, 'Hey Shaphan, go to the house of the LORD and tell 'em what's up.' 4. Just head over to Hilkiah, the high priest, and ask him to count all the cash that's been brought to the house of the LORD. The guards at the entrance have gathered it from the people. {door: Hebrew for threshold} 5. And they should give it to the people in charge of the Lord's house, who will fix any damage or holes in the building. 6. For the carpenters, builders, and masons to get supplies like wood and cut stones for fixing up the house. 7. But they didn't have to show receipts or keep track of the money they were given, 'cause they were totally reliable and never messed up. 8. Yo, Hilkiah, the high priest, tells Shaphan, the scribe, 'Yo, bro, I found the book of the law up in the house of the LORD!' Hilkiah hands the book to Shaphan, and he starts reading it, man. 9. So Shaphan, the scribe, went up to the king and gave him an update. He said, 'Yo, bro! Your squad totally collected all the cash we found in the crib and handed it over to those in charge of keeping the house of the LORD in top shape.' 10. So Shaphan, the scribe, approached the king and said, 'Yo, Hilkiah the priest hooked me up with this lit book.' And then Shaphan started reading it for the king. 11. So, like, when the king heard the words from the book of the law, he totally freaked out and tore his clothes. 12. Then the king told Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, who is Shaphan's son, Achbor, who is Michaiah's son, Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah, one of the king's servants, this: {Achbor: or, Abdon} {Michaiah: or, Micah} 13. Hey, guys! So, like, go and hit up the LORD for me, you know? And not just for me, but for the whole crew and all of Judah. We gotta find out what the deal is with this book we found, 'cause the LORD is super mad at us. Our parents totally didn't listen to what this book says, and we need to get our act together and do everything it says about us. 14. So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to talk to Huldah, the awesome prophetess. She's the wife of Shallum, Tikvah's son, Harhas' grandson, and keeper of all the fly outfits (you got that 'wardrobe' Hebrew translation!). She lives in Jerusalem, probably in some rad college, and they had a dope conversation with her. 15. And she was like, yo dudes, the LORD God of Israel has a message for the guy who sent you to me, 16. Yo, listen up! The big man upstairs says, 'Pay attention, peeps! I'm about to bring some serious bad juju to this joint and everyone living in it, just like what the king of Judah read in that book.' 17. They've straight up abandoned me and are offering incense to other gods, just to tick me off with all the stuff they make. So now I'm about to get seriously mad at this place and there's no way I'm gonna calm down. 18. Yo, to the king of Judah who sent you to ask the LORD, this is what you gotta tell him. The LORD God of Israel got something to say about the stuff you've been hearing. 19. Because you were so soft-hearted and totally humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard what I said about this place and its people being destroyed and cursed, and you tore your clothes and cried in front of me, I gotta say, I heard you loud and clear, says the LORD. 20. Yo, listen up! I'm gonna bring you back to your ancestors and you'll peacefully rest in your grave. Lucky for you, you won't have to witness all the crazy bad stuff I'm gonna bring upon this area. The message got delivered to the king, just so you know. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 221. Josiah {was} eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath. 2. And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. 3. And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, {that} the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying, 4. Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people: {door: Heb. threshold} 5. And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which {is} in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house, 6. Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house. 7. Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully. 8. And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it. 9. And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD. {gathered: Heb. melted} 10. And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king. 11. And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes. 12. And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying, {Achbor: or, Abdon} {Michaiah: or, Micah} 13. Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great {is} the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us. 14. So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her. {wardrobe: Heb. garments} {in the...: or, in the second part} 15. And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me, 16. Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, {even} all the words of the book which the king of Judah hath read: 17. Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched. 18. But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, {As touching} the words which thou hast heard; 19. Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard {thee}, saith the LORD. 20. Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 231. So the king messaged all the OGs from Judah and Jerusalem, and they all came together. 2. So the king and all the people, including the guys from Judah and Jerusalem, as well as the priests, prophets, and everyone else, both young and old, went up to the house of the LORD. And the king straight up read aloud all the words of the book of the covenant that they found there. 3. So the king goes over to a pillar and takes an oath in front of the LORD. He promises to follow the LORD, obey His commandments, testimonies, and statutes with all their heart and soul. They commit to fulfilling the words written in this book. And everyone there agrees to this covenant. 4. So the king was like, 'Yo Hilkiah, the high priest, and all you other priests and doorkeepers, go get all those Baal and grove idols and stuff from the LORD's temple and burn 'em outside Jerusalem in the Kidron fields. Then take the ashes to Bethel.' 5. He got rid of the priests who were into idol worship, the ones that the kings of Judah had set up to burn incense in the high places across Judah and around Jerusalem. He even took down those who were burning incense to Baal, the sun, the moon, and all the cosmic stuff. (Btw, 'put down' here means he made them stop, and 'idolatrous priests' means the ones who worshipped idols, just fyi.) 6. Then he took the grove out of the LORD's house, outside of Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and set it on fire at the brook Kidron, and crushed it into tiny bits, and scattered the bits over the graves of the people's children. 7. And he demolished the houses of those who engaged in wicked practices, which were near the house of the LORD, where the women made beautiful tapestries for idol worship. 8. So he gathered all the priests from the different cities of Judah, and messed up the spots where they were offering incense, from Geba to Beersheba. He even destroyed the high places near the gates of the city, specifically the ones on the left of the gate, where Joshua the governor used to hang out. 9. But even though the high-ranking priests didn't go to the main altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, they still got to eat the unleavened bread with their buddies. 10. And he totally wrecked Topheth, which, like, it's this place in the valley where the children of Hinnom were at, you know? He did that so that nobody would ever do this messed up thing where they sacrifice their own kids in the fire for Molech. Like, that's just not cool, man. 11. So, he, like, totally confiscated those horses that the kings of Judah dedicated to the sun god, right at the entrance of the Lord's house. It was near Nathanmelech's office in the suburbs. And guess what? He actually set fire to those sun chariots. Yeah, burned them to a crisp! (BTW, Nathanmelech might be a eunuch or some high-ranking officer, just saying) 12. So, the king totally destroyed the altars on the upper floor of Ahaz's palace that the kings of Judah had built. He also smashed the altars that Manasseh had set up in the two courtyards of the house of the LORD. Then he threw the dust from those altars into the brook Kidron. It was a total demolition! 13. And the cool hangout spots that were around Jerusalem, on the right side of the shady hill where bad stuff went down, which King Solomon of Israel built for Ashtoreth (a god the Zidonians worshiped) and for Chemosh (a god the Moabites thought was cool) and for Milcom (a god the Ammonites were into), the king totally ruined. (That shady hill was actually the Mount of Olives, BTW.) 14. And he totally smashed all those statues, like, broke them to smithereens, and chopped down all those groves, and filled up those spots with human remains. Like, he didn't play around, he got rid of all those false idols and replaced them with bones of real people. So legit, man! {images: Heb. statues} 15. Yo, so there was this altar at Bethel, right? And this high place that Jeroboam, Nebat's son, made. He's the one who led Israel into sin. Well, guess what? He totally wrecked that altar and burned down the high place. Then he crushed it to tiny bits and burned the grove. It was intense, bro. 16. And when Josiah turned around, he noticed the tombs that were on the hill. He then sent someone to retrieve the bones from the tombs and burned them on the altar, which made it impure, just as the LORD's message from the man of God said. 17. And he was like, 'Yo, what's up with that sign over there?' And the locals were like, 'Oh, that's the tomb of the dude who came all the way from Judah and called out the messed up stuff you did to the altar in Bethel.' 18. And he was like, leave him be; don't mess with his bones. So they just left his bones alone, along with the bones of that prophet from Samaria. 19. Josiah straight up yeeted all those fancy high places that the Israelite kings built in Samaria to tick off the Lord. He totally got rid of them and did the same thing he did to them in Bethel. 20. Then he got rid of all the priests at the fancy worship spots, sacrificed them on the altars, and burned people's bones on them. Afterwards, he went back to Jerusalem. 21. And the king's like, yo, everyone gotta celebrate Passover for the LORD your God, just like it says in the book of this agreement, fam. 22. For real, there has never been a Passover like this since the OG judges in Israel, or even during the time of the kings of Israel and Judah. No cap. 23. But yo, in the eighteenth year that king Josiah was rockin' it, this passover party went down in Jerusalem to give major props to the LORD. 24. Josiah got rid of all the fortune tellers, magicians, idols, and other disgusting stuff that he found in Judah and Jerusalem. He did this to follow the rules written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. 25. And there was no king before him who was like him, who wholeheartedly turned to the LORD and followed all the laws of Moses, and there was no one like him after him either. 26. But like, even though the LORD was super mad and furious at Judah because of all the stuff Manasseh did to piss Him off, He didn't like, back down from His anger and stuff. Like, it was a really intense situation and there were, like, a lot of things that made God angry. 27. God said, Judah's getting the boot just like Israel did. Jerusalem, the city I picked, is getting ghosted too. And the house where I said my name would be? Yeah, it's gonna be left behind. 28. Yo, if you wanna know more about what Josiah did, check out the book of the kings of Judah. It's all written down there, fam. 29. During this time, Pharaohnechoh, the boss of Egypt, decided to take on the king of Assyria by heading to the river Euphrates. Our dude, king Josiah, wasn't about to back down, so he went up against Pharaohnechoh and straight up took him out at a place called Megiddo. No messing around, just quick and decisive - Josiah saw him and finished him off. 30. And then his homies took his lifeless body in a fancy carriage from Megiddo and rolled him all the way to Jerusalem, where they laid him to rest in his own tomb. Meanwhile, the locals crowned Jehoahaz, son of Josiah, and gave him the royal treatment, making him the new king in his pops' place. 31. Jehoahaz took the throne at the age of 23 and ruled over Jerusalem for only 3 months. His mom's name was Hamutal, and she was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. (Jehoahaz was also known as Shallum.) 32. And he, like, did some really messed up stuff in the eyes of the LORD, following in the footsteps of his ancestors and all. 33. Pharaohnechoh straight-up locked him down in Riblah, in the land of Hamath, so he couldn't be the ruler of Jerusalem anymore. And to add insult to injury, he made them pay a hefty fee of a hundred talents of silver and one talent of gold. Talk about a fine! 34. So like, Pharaohnechoh was like, 'Hey Eliakim, you're the new king now instead of your dad Josiah!' And then Pharaohnechoh changed his name to Jehoiakim, and he totally took Jehoahaz away. And guess what? Jehoiakim went to Egypt, and that's where he passed away. 35. So Jehoiakim gave Pharaoh all the silver and gold. But to gather the money, he made the people pay taxes as Pharaoh commanded. Each person had to give a certain amount based on their income, and it all went straight to Pharaohnechoh. 36. Jehoiakim was like 25 when he started ruling, and he ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mom's name was Zebudah, and she was Pedaiah from Rumah's daughter. 37. And he did some really messed up stuff in God's view, just like his parents did. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 231. And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem. 2. And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD. {both...: Heb. from small even unto great} 3. And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all {their} heart and all {their} soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant. 4. And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel. 5. And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven. {put...: Heb. caused to cease} {idolatrous...: Heb. Chemarim} {planets: or, twelve signs or, constellations} 6. And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped {it} small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people. 7. And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that {were} by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove. {hangings: Heb. houses} 8. And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the gates that {were} in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which {were} on a man's left hand at the gate of the city. 9. Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren. 10. And he defiled Topheth, which {is} in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. 11. And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which {was} in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire. {chamberlain: or, eunuch, or, officer} 12. And the altars that {were} on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake {them} down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron. {brake...: or, ran from thence} 13. And the high places that {were} before Jerusalem, which {were} on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile. {the mount...: that is, the mount of Olives} 14. And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men. {images: Heb. statues} 15. Moreover the altar that {was} at Bethel, {and} the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, {and} stamped {it} small to powder, and burned the grove. 16. And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that {were} there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned {them} upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words. 17. Then he said, What title {is} that that I see? And the men of the city told him, {It is} the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel. 18. And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of Samaria. {bones alone: Heb. bones to escape} 19. And all the houses also of the high places that {were} in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke {the LORD} to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel. 20. And he slew all the priests of the high places that {were} there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to Jerusalem. {slew: or, sacrificed} 21. And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as {it is} written in the book of this covenant. 22. Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah; 23. But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, {wherein} this passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem. 24. Moreover the {workers with} familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. {images: or, teraphim} 25. And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there {any} like him. 26. Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him withal. {provocations: Heb. angers} 27. And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there. 28. Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 29. In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him. 30. And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead. 31. Jehoahaz {was} twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. {Jehoahaz: also called, Shallum} 32. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done. 33. And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold. {that...: or, because he reigned} {put the...: Heb. set a fine upon the land} 34. And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there. 35. And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give {it} unto Pharaohnechoh. 36. Jehoiakim {was} twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 37. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 241. So, like, during that time when Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, was in charge, Jehoiakim was all serving him for three years and then he was like, 'Nah, I'm outta here' and rebelled against him. 2. Then God sent groups of the Chaldeans, Syrians, Moabites, and Ammonites to go against Judah and wreck it, just like He said through His prophets. 3. Like, the LORD totally made this happen to Judah because they were like so not cool in His eyes, all because of Manasseh's sins, you know, everything he did and stuff. 4. And like, because of all the innocent blood he like totally spilled, man: he straight up filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the Lord was like not gonna let that slide, you know? 5. Like, wanna know more about what Jehoiakim did? Check out the book of chronicles of the kings of Judah, fam. It's all there, every single detail! 6. And then Jehoiakim passed away, and Jehoiachin, his son, became the new ruler. 7. So basically, the king of Egypt couldn't leave his own turf anymore because the king of Babylon straight up snagged everything under the king of Egypt's control, all the way from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates. 8. Jehoiachin was just 18 when he took the throne, ruling over Jerusalem for a quick three months. His mom's name was Nehushta, and she was the daughter of Elnathan, a Jerusalem OG. By the way, Jehoiachin also went by the names Jeconiah and Coniah. 9. And he did some seriously messed up stuff that made the LORD super disappointed, just like his dad did before him. 10. So, like, one day the peeps who worked for Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, surrounded Jerusalem and put it in lockdown. This city was totally besieged, ya know. 11. So, like, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, totally came and attacked the city, and his crew showed up and surrounded it. 12. So Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, rolled up on the king of Babylon along with his squad, his mom, his crew, and his entourage. And yo, the king of Babylon straight up nabbed him in his eighth year on the throne. (P.S. officers can also mean eunuchs, just saying. And Nebuchadnezzar was the king in his eighth year, you feel?) 13. And he like totally grabbed all the lit treasures from the LORD's crib and the king's crib, and smashed all the sick gold stuff that King Solomon made for the LORD's hangout, just like the LORD said. 14. And he took everybody from Jerusalem, including all the leaders and the brave warriors, like, ten thousand prisoners, and all the skilled workers and craftsmen. Like, no one was left behind except for the poorest people in the land. 15. Then he took Jehoiachin, the king's mom, the king's wives, his peeps, and the powerful folks from the land and brought them as captive to Babylon from Jerusalem. (BTW, officers here can also mean eunuchs) 16. So, like, the king of Babylon totally captured about 7,000 brave dudes, plus like, a thousand skilled craftsmen and smiths. They were all strong and ready for war, and he brought them as captives to Babylon. 17. So, like, the king of Babylon, right, he made Mattaniah, his dad's brother, the new king instead. And get this, he even gave him a cool new name, Zedekiah. 18. Zedekiah became king when he was 21 years old and ruled over Jerusalem for 11 years. His mom's name was Hamutal, and she was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 19. And he straight up did some messed up stuff that the LORD was seriously not cool with, just like Jehoiakim did. 20. So, basically, God got super mad and decided to punish the people of Jerusalem and Judah by kicking them out of His sight. And guess what? Zedekiah was like, 'Nah, I ain't playin' along with the king of Babylon!' \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 241. In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him. 2. And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets. {by: Heb. by the hand of} 3. Surely at the commandment of the LORD came {this} upon Judah, to remove {them} out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did; 4. And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon. 5. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 6. So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. 7. And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land: for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt. 8. Jehoiachin {was} eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name {was} Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. {Jehoiachin: also called Jeconiah and Coniah} 9. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father had done. 10. At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged. {was...: Heb. came into siege} 11. And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and his servants did besiege it. 12. And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign. {officers: or, eunuchs} {his reign: Nebuchadnezzar's eighth year} 13. And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said. 14. And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, {even} ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. 15. And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, {those} carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. {officers: or, eunuchs} 16. And all the men of might, {even} seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths a thousand, all {that were} strong {and} apt for war, even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon. 17. And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah. 18. Zedekiah {was} twenty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 19. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. 20. For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Kings 251. So, like, in the ninth year that Nebuchadnezzar was king, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of that month, he and all his crew rolled up to Jerusalem and set up camp. They even built some sick forts all around the city. 2. And the city was totally locked down until King Zedekiah's eleventh year, like, no one could get in or out, it was like a fortress. 3. And like, on the ninth day of the fourth month, the whole city was dealing with a major famine, ya know? No bread left for the peeps living there. 4. And the city was totally wrecked, and all the dudes who fought for the city straight up bounced in the middle of the night through this sick backdoor route between two walls, right outside the king's fancy garden. (By the way, the Chaldees were totally surrounding the city, just in case you didn't know.) And the king peaced out towards the open field. 5. Then the Chaldees' squad came chasing after the king, and caught up with him in the Jericho fields. And all his crew got split up and scattered. 6. So they captured the king and brought him before the king of Babylon in Riblah, and they passed judgment on him. {passed judgment: Hebrew for talked things over with him} 7. So they killed Zedekiah's sons right in front of him, and then they blinded Zedekiah and chained him up with brass cuffs. After that, they took him to Babylon. 8. So, like, in the fifth month, on the seventh day, you know, it was the nineteenth year that King Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of Babylon, was in charge. And then this dude, Nebuzaradan, the head honcho of the palace guards, you feel me, who was like a servant to the Babylonian king, like, totally showed up in Jerusalem. 9. And he completely destroyed the house of the LORD, the king's house, and all the crib houses in Jerusalem. Every fancy house went up in flames. 10. And all the squad of the Chaldees, who were rolling with the leader of the squad, totally wrecked the walls of Jerusalem from all sides. 11. So, like, there were still some peeps left in the city, ya know? And those who ran away to join the king of Babylon, plus the remaining crew, got taken away by Nebuzaradan, the big boss of the guards. (By the way, 'fugitives' means those who bailed on their peeps, if you didn't know.) 12. So, like, the captain of the guard, right? He totally let some of the poor peeps stay behind to work on the vineyards and farms, you know? 13. The Chaldeans totally wrecked the brass pillars, bases, and bronze sea in the LORD's house and took all that bronze to Babylon. 14. And they grabbed all the pots, shovels, snuffers, spoons, and every brass instrument they used for their duties. 15. Then the captain of the guard grabbed all the firepans, bowls, and other golden and silver stuff and took them away, matching gold with gold and silver with silver. 16. Solomon made two big pillars, a huge water basin, and some strong bases for the LORD's house. The brass used for all of these things was so heavy that it couldn't even be weighed. #impressive 17. The first pillar was like eighteen cubits tall, with a cool brass chapiter on top that was like three cubits tall. It had these dope wreathen work and pomegranates all around it, also made of brass. The second pillar was just as rad, with the same kind of wreathen work. 18. The head honcho of the squad grabbed Seraiah, the high priest, and Zephaniah, the second-in-command priest, along with the three door guardians. (BTW, the original Hebrew uses the word 'threshold' for 'door'.) 19. Then he captured a high-ranking military officer from the city, along with five dudes who were close to the king, and the head scribe who organized all the people in the land, as well as sixty regular people that were found in the city. 20. So Nebuzaradan, the leader of the security team, gathered them up and brought them to the Babylonian king in Riblah: 21. And then the king of Babylon totally wrecked them, like, completely wiped them out at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah got totally expelled from their land. 22. So, there were still some people left in Judah after Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, did his thing. And guess what? He chose Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, to be in charge of them. 23. When all the army leaders and their crew found out that the king of Babylon appointed Gedaliah as governor, they went to Mizpah to meet him. Ishmael, Johanan, Seraiah, and Jaazaniah, along with their squads, were among them. 24. And Gedaliah promised them, and their squad, and said, don't stress about becoming the Chaldees' minions: just chill in the land, do your thing for the king of Babylon, and everything will be lit. 25. So, like, in the seventh month, this dude Ishmael, who's the son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama, from a real important family and all, showed up with ten of his homies and straight up killed Gedaliah. Like, Gedaliah was dead, and even the Jews and the Chaldeans who were chilling with him at Mizpah got messed up too. Just FYI, 'royal' means 'of the kingdom' in the original language. 26. So, like, everyone, from the little peeps to the big shots, and even the army bosses, got up and hightailed it to Egypt because they were totally scared of the Chaldees. 27. So, like, after Jehoiachin king of Judah was, like, held captive for 37 years, in the 12th month, on the 27th day of the month, Evilmerodach king of Babylon, during his first year of ruling, released Jehoiachin king of Judah from prison. 28. And he was super chill with him, and gave him a major upgrade, placing his throne even higher than the other kings in Babylon; like, they were all tight, you know? 29. And he switched up his prison fits: and he stayed snacking on bread non-stop, straight flexin' like that for all the days of his life. 30. And he got a sick daily vibe from the king, like a constant flex that lasted for his whole life, every single day without fail. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Kings 251. And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth {day} of the month, {that} Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about. 2. And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 3. And on the ninth {day} of the {fourth} month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land. 4. And the city was broken up, and all the men of war {fled} by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which {is} by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees {were} against the city round about:) and {the king} went the way toward the plain. 5. And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were scattered from him. 6. So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him. {gave...: Heb. spake judgment with him} 7. And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon. {put...: Heb. made blind} 8. And in the fifth month, on the seventh {day} of the month, which {is} the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem: {captain...: or, chief marshal} 9. And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great {man's} house burnt he with fire. 10. And all the army of the Chaldees, that {were with} the captain of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about. 11. Now the rest of the people {that were} left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away. {fugitives: Heb. fallen away} 12. But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land {to be} vinedressers and husbandmen. 13. And the pillars of brass that {were} in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that {was} in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon. 14. And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. 15. And the firepans, and the bowls, {and} such things as {were} of gold, {in} gold, and of silver, {in} silver, the captain of the guard took away. 16. The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight. {one...: Heb. the one sea} 17. The height of the one pillar {was} eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it {was} brass: and the height of the chapiter three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work. 18. And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: {door: Heb. threshold} 19. And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's presence, which were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and threescore men of the people of the land {that were} found in the city: {officer: or, eunuch} {were in...: Heb. saw the king's face} {principal...: or, scribe of the captain of the host} 20. And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah: 21. And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land. 22. And {as for} the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler. 23. And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. 24. And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well with you. 25. But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came, and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah. {royal: Heb. of the kingdom} 26. And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of the Chaldees. 27. And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth {day} of the month, {that} Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison; 28. And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that {were} with him in Babylon; {kindly...: Heb. good things with him} 29. And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread continually before him all the days of his life. 30. And his allowance {was} a continual allowance given him of the king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 11. Adam, Sheth, Enosh, 2. Kenan, Mahalaleel, Jered, 3. LOL, Henoch, Methuselah, Lamech, 4. Yo, we got Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth in the house! 5. The fam of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. 6. And Gomer had sons named Ashchenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. (Some copies also mention Diphath instead of Riphath) 7. And Javan had these sons: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. (Some copies say Rodanim instead of Dodanim) 8. So, like, Ham had these sons: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan. 9. These were the descendants of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabta, Raamah, and Sabtecha. And from Raamah came Sheba and Dedan. 10. And Cush had a son named Nimrod: he totally started flexing and becoming super powerful on the planet. 11. Mizraim had kids named Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, and Naphtuhim. 12. And there were Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (from whom the Philistines originated), and the Caphthorim. 13. And Canaan had a kid named Zidon, who was his oldest, and also Heth. 14. The Jebusite, the Amorite, and the Girgashite were all there too, 15. There were also the Hivites, Arkites, and Sinites, 16. And like, there were these Arvadite dudes, and the Zemarite squad, and the Hamathite homies. 17. Shem's squad consisted of Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, Aram, Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshech (also known as Mash). 18. And Arphaxad had a son named Shelah, and Shelah had a son named Eber. 19. Eber had two sons - one named Peleg, because in his time the Earth was split, and his brother named Joktan. Peleg means division. 20. And Joktan had Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, 21. Hadoram, Uzal, and Diklah were also there, 22. Like, there were these dudes named Ebal, Abimael, and Sheba, 23. And there were Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. Joktan was their dad, you know. 24. Shem, Arphaxad, and Shelah, yo, 25. Eber, Peleg, Reu, bro, 26. Serug, Nahor, Terah, 27. Abram? Yeah, that's Abraham, fam. 28. Abraham had two sons - Isaac and Ishmael. Just that, homies. 29. Here's the fam lineage: Ishmael's firstborn was Nebaioth, followed by Kedar, Adbeel, and Mibsam, 30. Yo, we got Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, and Tema, aka Hadad or Hadar. 31. Yo, check it out - we got Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. Those are the homies, Ishmael's sons. 32. So Abraham had some more kids with his side chick, Keturah. She had Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. And Jokshan had two sons, Sheba and Dedan. 33. And Midian had some chill sons - Ephah, Epher, Henoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All of them were Keturah's fam. 34. And Abraham became the father of Isaac. Isaac had two sons: Esau and Israel. 35. Esau's kids were Eliphaz, Reuel, Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah. 36. Eliphaz had some chill sons: Teman, Omar, Zephi (or Zepho), Gatam, Kenaz, Timna, and Amalek. 37. Reuel's sons: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. 💯 38. Bruh, check out these homies, the sons of Seir: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. 39. So, like, Lotan had these sons, you know? Hori, Homam, and Timna, who was Lotan's sister. (Homam can also be called Hemam, just FYI.) 40. Shobal's kids were Alian, Manahath, Ebal, Shephi, and Onam. Zibeon's kids were Aiah and Anah. (Alian was also known as Alvan, and Shephi was also called Shepho.) 41. Anah had a kid named Dishon and Dishon had four kids - Amram, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. (Amram could also be called Hemdan) 42. The squad of Ezer had Bilhan, Zavan, and Jakan in it. Dishan's crew included Uz and Aran. (Jakan is also known as Akan.) 43. So, these were the kings who ruled in Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites, starting with Bela, the son of Beor, who was the ruler of the city called Dinhabah. 44. Once Bela kicked the bucket, Jobab, Zerah's kid from Bozrah, took over the kingdom. 45. So after Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites took over as ruler. 46. And after Husham passed away, Hadad, Bedad's son, who defeated Midian in the territory of Moab, became the new ruler. He named his city Avith. 47. And once Hadad passed away, Samlah of Masrekah took over as the new ruler. 48. And yo, when Samlah passed away, Shaul from Rehoboth by the river took over the throne in his place. 49. And after Shaul passed away, Baalhanan, Achbor's son, became king in his place. 50. After Baalhanan died, Hadad took over as ruler. He ruled from the city called Pai and his wife's name was Mehetabel. She was the daughter of Matred and the granddaughter of Mezahab. Some also call Hadad by the name Hadar and Pai by the name Pau. 51. Hadad also bit the dust. And the cool kids of Edom were: Timnah, the leader of the pack, Aliah, the influencer, and Jetheth, the boss. 52. The key players in the game were Aholibamah, Elah, and Pinon, 53. Yo, Kenaz, Teman, and Mibzar holdin' it down as the top dukes! 54. Yo, Magdiel and Iram holdin' it down as bosses in Edom. These are the top dogs. \n",

      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 21. These are the OGs of Israel: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun, also known as Jacob. 2. Bruh, we got Dan, Joseph, and Benjamin in the mix. We can't forget Naphtali, Gad, and Asher too. 3. The dudes from Judah were Er, Onan, and Shelah. These three were born to him through a girl named Shua, who was a Canaanite. Now, Judah's firstborn, Er, didn't exactly have good vibes with the LORD. In fact, the LORD wasn't really feeling him and ended up taking him out. 4. And Tamar, his daughter-in-law, gave birth to Pharez and Zerah. Judah had a total of five sons. 5. The homies of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. 6. Here are the names of Zerah's sons: Zimri, Ethan, Heman, Calcol, and Dara. Five of them in total. Zimri could also be called Zabdi, and Dara could also be called Darda. 7. The dudes from Carmi were Achar, the one causing trouble for Israel. He totally messed up and broke the rules by taking something that was cursed. {Achar: or, Achan} 8. And Ethan's squad was lit with his son, Azariah. 9. Hezron had three sons, named Jerahmeel, Ram (also known as Aram) and Chelubai (also called Caleb). 10. So, Ram became the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab became the dad of Nahshon, who was like the awesome ruler of the people from the tribe of Judah. 11. Nahshon was the real OG who gave birth to Salma, who then passed on the vibes and brought Boaz into this world. (Salma was known as Salmon too, just FYI) 12. And Boaz became the proud parent of Obed, and Obed became the proud parent of Jesse, 13. And Jesse had his firstborn Eliab, then Abinadab came next, and Shimma came after him, {Shimma: or, Shammah} 14. Nethaneel be rollin' in at four, Raddai takin' it to the next level at number five, 15. Ozem #6, David #7: 16. Zeruiah and Abigail were like, the sisters, ya know? And Zeruiah had three sons: Abishai, Joab, and Asahel. 17. Abigail had a son named Amasa, and his dad was Jether the Ishmeelite. (Jether, also known as Ithra, was an Israelite.) 18. And Caleb, Hezron's son, had children with his wife Azubah and Jerioth. Their sons were Jesher, Shobab, and Ardon. 19. When Azubah passed away, Caleb decided to marry Ephrath, who then gave birth to his son named Hur. 20. And Hur had a kid named Uri, and Uri had a kid named Bezaleel. 21. And then Hezron got together with the daughter of Machir, Gilead's dad, and they got hitched when he hit the big 6-0; and she gave birth to Segub. 22. And Segub had a son named Jair, who was totally ballin' with twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead. 23. And he totally conquered Geshur and Aram, along with all the cool cities of Jair, including Kenath and its surrounding towns. Yep, he basically took over sixty cities! All of this was owned by the awesome sons of Machir, who was the father of Gilead. 24. And when Hezron passed away in Calebephratah, his wife Abiah gave birth to Ashur, the father of Tekoa. 25. The oldest son of Hezron, Jerahmeel, had some cool sons: Ram, who was the firstborn, and there's also Bunah, Oren, Ozem, and Ahijah. 26. Jerahmeel had another wife named Atarah and she was the mother of Onam too. 27. Ram, who was Jerahmeel's firstborn, had three sons: Maaz, Jamin, and Eker. 28. The dudes Onam had two sons, Shammai and Jada. Shammai's sons were named Nadab and Abishur. 29. Abishur's wife was named Abihail, and together they had Ahban and Molid. 30. And Nadab's sons were Seled and Appaim, but Seled passed away without having kids. 31. And Appaim had a son named Ishi. Ishi had a son named Sheshan. And Sheshan had some children, including Ahlai. 32. So like, Jada's bro Shammai had these sons, Jether and Jonathan. But Jether, he didn't have any kids and died, man. 33. And Jonathan had two sons named Peleth and Zaza. These were the sons of Jerahmeel. 34. So, Sheshan didn't have any sons, just daughters. And he had this servant, who was an Egyptian dude named Jarha. 35. So Sheshan arranged for his daughter to marry his servant, Jarha, and they had a son named Attai. 36. And Attai had a son named Nathan, and Nathan had a son named Zabad, 37. And Zabad had a kid named Ephlal, and Ephlal became the father of Obed, 38. And Obed had a kid named Jehu, and Jehu had a kid named Azariah, 39. And Azariah had a kid named Helez, who then had a kid named Eleasah, 40. And Eleasah had a kid named Sisamai, and Sisamai had a kid named Shallum, 41. And Shallum had a kid named Jekamiah, and Jekamiah had a kid named Elishama. 42. So, like, Caleb's bro Jerahmeel had some sons. First up was Mesha, who was the father of Ziph. And then there were the sons of Mareshah, who was the father of Hebron. 43. The homies from Hebron were Korah, Tappuah, Rekem, and Shema. 44. And Shema became the dad of Raham, who was the cool parent of Jorkoam. And Rekem became the dad of Shammai. 45. Shammai had a son named Maon, who became the father of Bethzur. 46. So Ephah, Caleb's concubine, had sons named Haran, Moza, and Gazez. And Haran was the father of Gazez. 47. And Jahdai had these sons: Regem, Jotham, Geshan, Pelet, Ephah, and Shaaph. 48. Maachah, Caleb's side babe, had Sheber and Tirhanah. 49. She also had Shaaph, who was the dad of Madmannah, Sheva, the dad of Machbenah, and the dad of Gibea. And Caleb's daughter's name was Achsah. 50. These dudes were the sons of Caleb, who came from Hur, the oldest son of Ephratah. Shobal was the dad of Kirjathjearim, (also known as Ephreth). 51. Salma was the OG of Bethlehem, and Hareph was the OG of Bethgader. 52. Yo, Shobal, he's the dad of Kirjathjearim and he got some kids, Haroeh and like, half of the Manahethites. You feel? Haroeh is also known as Reaiah. And, um, when we say 'half of the Manahethites,' it could mean like, half of the Menuchites or Hatsihammenuchoth, you know what I'm saying? 53. And there were these cool tribes in Kirjathjearim: the Ithrites, the Puhites, the Shumathites, and the Mishraites. And out of them came the Zareathites and the Eshtaulites, no biggie. 54. Some of Salma's descendants were from Bethlehem and the Netophathites. Then there were those from Ataroth and the house of Joab, as well as half of the Manahethites and the Zorites. By the way, Ataroth could also be known as Atarites or crowns of the house of Joab, just FYI! 😇 55. And there were these really cool families of scribes that lived in Jabez, like the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and the Suchathites. Oh, and let's not forget about the Kenites who are descendants of Hemath, the awesome founder of the Rechab clan! \n",

      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 31. So like, here's the deal. These are the sons of David, you know, the homie who was living it up in Hebron. First off, we got Amnon, who was born to him by Ahinoam, the Jezreelitess. And then we got Daniel, also known as Chileab, who came from Abigail, the Carmelitess. Pretty cool, huh? 🤟🏼 2.

These were the kids he had in Jerusalem: Shimea, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, four of them, with Bathshua, the daughter of Ammiel. (Shimea also goes by Shammua. Bathshua is also known as Bathsheba. And Ammiel's alternate name is Eliam.) 6. There were also Ibhar, Elishama, and Eliphelet (who was also known as Elishua). 7. And like, Nogah was there, and Nepheg, and Japhia, you know? 8.

And Jeconiah's children were Assir and Salathiel, who was also known as Shealtiel. 18. There were also Malchiram, Pedaiah, Shenazar, Jecamiah, Hoshama, and Nedabiah on the squad. 19.

      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 41. The homies of Judah were Pharez, Hezron, Carmi (aka Chelubai or Caleb), Hur, and Shobal, y'know. 2. So Reaiah, Shobal's son, became the father of Jahath, who then had Ahumai and Lahad. These are the Zorathites' clans. (Reaiah is also known as Haroeh) 3. And these were the fam of Etam: Jez, Ish, and Iddi, and their sis was Hazza! 4. And Penuel, the OG dad of Gedor, and Ezer, the cool dad of Hushah. These dudes are the sons of Hur, the oldest one from Ephratah, the one who started it all in Bethlehem. 5. So like, this dude Ashur from Tekoa, he had, you know, two wives - Helah and Naarah. 6. And Naarah had children named Ahuzam, Hepher, Temeni, and Haahashtari. These were Naarah's sons. 7. Helah had three sons named Zereth, Jezoar, and Ethnan. 8. And Coz had Anub, Zobebah, and the rest of Aharhel's descendants, who was Harum's son. 9. So, Jabez was like, totally cooler than his bros and his mom gave him a name that was like, super deep. She called him Jabez which means like, being all sad and stuff. {Jabez: which is totes, like, sorrowful} 10. So Jabez hits up the God of Israel like, 'Yo, I'm really hoping you can hook me up with some serious blessings, make my territory bigger and keep me away from all the bad stuff that could mess me up.' And guess what? God totally grants his request, no hesitation. Epic, right? 11. And Chelub, Shuah's bro, had a son named Mehir who became the dad of Eshton. 12. Eshton had three sons: Bethrapha, Paseah, and Tehinnah, who was the father of Irnahash. These were the people who lived in Rechah. (Irnahash was also known as the city of Nahash.) 13. And Kenaz had two sons, Othniel and Seraiah. Othniel also had a son named Hathath. 14. And Meonothai had a kid named Ophrah, and Seraiah had a kid named Joab, who became the leader of the creative community in the valley of Charashim, because they were all really skilled at their crafts. (The valley area was actually inhabited by these craftsmen.) 15. And Caleb's boys were Iru, Elah, Naam, and their brother Kenaz, who was the son of Elah. 16. And Jehaleleel had these sons: Ziph, Ziphah, Tiria, and Asareel. 17. Ezra had some cool offspring: Jether, Mered, Epher, and Jalon. Their momma also gave birth to Miriam, Shammai, and Ishbah, who's the dad of Eshtemoa. 18. And Jehudijah, his wife, had a son named Jered who became the father of Gedor. Heber became the father of Socho, and Jekuthiel became the father of Zanoah. These were the sons of Bithiah, the daughter of Pharaoh, whom Mered married. (Jehudijah was also known as the Jewess.) 19. And Hodiah's sons were Keilah the Garmite and Eshtemoa the Maachathite. (Hodiah was Naham's sister.) 20. Shimon had sons named Amnon, Rinnah, Benhanan, and Tilon. Ishi had sons named Zoheth and Benzoheth. 21. Shelah, who was Judah's son, had some cool kids. There was Er, the dude who founded Lecah, and Laadah, the guy who started Mareshah. They were part of the fams who rocked the fine linen game, repping the house of Ashbea. 22. And Jokim, the squad from Chozeba, Joash, Saraph, who held it down in Moab, and Jashubilehem. And these are like, old school facts. 23. These were the skilled artisans, and those who lived amidst nature and greenery. They resided alongside the king to execute their crafts. 24. Simeon had these lit sons: Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and Shaul. Nemuel could also be called Jemuel. Jarib and Zerah could also be known as Jachin and Zohar, ya feel? 25. Shallum had a son named Mibsam, who had a son named Mishma. 26. And Mishma had some dope sons - Hamuel, Zacchur, and Shimei. 27. So Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters, but his siblings didn't have as many kids and their family didn't grow as much as the children of Judah did. 28. So they stayed in Beersheba, Moladah, and Hazarshual. 29. And they named their places Bilhah, Ezem, and Tolad. 30. And like, at Bethuel, and Hormah, and Ziklag, you know? 31. And in Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and in Bethbirei, and in Shaaraim. These were their cities until David became king. (Hazarsusim can also be called Hazarsusah) 32. And these were their towns: Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen, and Ashan, a total of five cities. (Etam could also be called Ether.) 33. And all the cool towns that surrounded those cities, up to Baal. These were the places they lived, and their family history. (Baal means Baalathbeer) (Their family history means how they grouped themselves by nations among them) 34. And there was also Meshobab, Jamlech, and Joshah, the son of Amaziah. 35. And there's this guy named Joel, and Jehu, he's the son of Josibiah, who's also the son of Seraiah, who happens to be the son of Asiel. 36. And we also got Elioenai, Jaakobah, Jeshohaiah, Asaiah, Adiel, Jesimiel, and Benaiah in the squad! 37. And Ziza, who was the child of Shiphi, who was the child of Allon, who was the child of Jedaiah, who was the child of Shimri, who was the child of Shemaiah; 38. These are the OGs of their families, known and respected in their names. And their family legacies grew like crazy, straight up multiplying. 39. So, they went to this spot called Gedor, which is, like, on the east side of the valley, looking for a place where their flocks can chillax and munch on some good grass. 40. So, like, they stumbled upon this lit pasture, you know? It was so good, and the land was mad spacious, chill and peaceful. Turns out, the peeps from Ham had been there for a hot minute. 41. So, this group of people, who were mentioned by name, showed up during the time when Hezekiah was the king of Judah. They basically went and wrecked the tents and homes they found there, completely wiping them out up until now. And guess what? They took over those spaces and made them their own, because there was some good pasture land for their flocks. 42. So like, some of the dudes from the Simeon crew, about five hundred of them, they rolled up to mount Seir. Leading the pack were Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel - these dudes are the sons of Ishi. 43. And they totally destroyed the remaining Amalekites who managed to escape, and settled there until now. \n",

And they found fat pasture and good, and the land {was} wide, and quiet, and peaceable; for {they} of Ham had dwelt there of old. 41. And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in their rooms: because {there was} pasture there for their flocks. 42. And {some} of them, {even} of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. 43.

      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 51. So, like, Reuben was the oldest son of Israel and stuff. But, like, he did something wrong by sleeping with his father's wife, so his birthright got taken away and given to Joseph's sons instead. And, just to be clear, the family tree doesn't follow the whole birthright thing anymore. 2. So, basically, Judah was the one who came out on top among his brothers and became the ruler. But, you know, the birthright belonged to Joseph. Like, he was the real deal, you know, the chief or whatever. #SiblingRivalry 3. So, Reuben, the OG son of Israel, had some siblings named Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 4. Yo, Joel's fam was lit! Shemaiah was his son, Gog was his son, and Shimei was his son too. 5. Micah's kid, Reaia's kid, Baal's kid, 6. Beerah, the dude who got taken hostage by Tilgathpilneser, the super powerful king of Assyria. Yeah, he used to be the top dog of the Reubenites. By the way, Tilgathpilneser is also known as Tiglathpileser. 7. So, like, his brothers from different families, when their family trees were all figured out, y'know, they were like the main dudes. We got Jeiel and Zechariah, they were like the top players, man. 8. So there's this dude named Bela, right? He's the son of Azaz, who's the son of Shema, who's the son of Joel. Bela was livin' it up in Aroer, chillin' all the way from Nebo to Baalmeon. Oh, and by the way, Shema is also known as Shemaiah, in case you were wonderin'. 9. And he went to the east until he reached the edge of the wild, from the Euphrates River, because their livestock had multiplied in the land of Gilead. 10. Back in Saul's time, there was a big showdown with the Hagarites and Saul's crew totally defeated them. After that, they set up camp all over the eastern part of Gilead. It was like their turf now, you know what I'm saying? 11. And the kids of Gad made their crib in the land of Bashan, all the way to Salchah: 12. Joel the leader, and Shapham the second in command, and Jaanai, and Shaphat rockin' it in Bashan. 13. And their squad from their fams were Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jachan, Zia, and Heber, a total of seven homies. 14. These are the fam of Abihail, he's the son of Huri, grandson of Jaroah, great-grandson of Gilead, great-great-grandson of Michael, super-great-grandson of Jeshishai, mega-great-grandson of Jahdo, and ultimate-great-grandson of Buz. 15. Yo, Ahi, the homie who's Abdiel's son, and Abdiel's Guni's son, be straight up leadin' the crew from their family's crib. 16. So they lived in Gilead in Bashan, and in the cool towns and hip neighborhoods of Sharon, all along their borders. {their...: Yeah, like, their stomping grounds} 17. Like, all this stuff was kept in record books back in the day when Jotham was king of Judah and Jeroboam was king of Israel. No cap. 18. The Reubenites, Gadites, and half of the Manassites were a bunch of fearless warriors, skilled in using shields, swords, bows, and knocking down enemies. There were a total of 44,760 of them who went off to battle. They were hardcore, no doubt about it! 19. And they totally clashed with the Hagarites squad, straight up battling Jetur, Nephish, and Nodab. 20. And they got major assistance against the Hagarites, who totally got wrecked, along with all their crew. Why? 'Cause they straight up called out to God during the battle, and He totally heard them and answered their prayers. It was all because they had mad trust in Him, no doubt. 21. And they straight up snatched their whole livestock game: like, 50K camels, 250K sheep, 2K donkeys, and a solid 100K homies. For real though, they totally took them captive, like no joke. #wildtimes 22. Many people died in the battle, because it was a war ordained by God. And they lived in their own places until they were taken captive. 23. And the kids from the half tribe of Manasseh were vibin' in the land: they totally blew up from Bashan all the way to Baalhermon and Senir, and even to mount Hermon. 24. And these were the bosses of their fam fams, like Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mega chads, legit famous dudes, and the top dogs of their fam fams. Y'know, those with big reputations. 25. And they, like, totally betrayed the God of their ancestors, and started hooking up with the gods that the folks in that land worshipped. But God already wiped out those gods, man. 26. So, the God of Israel got the attention of Pul, the king of Assyria, and Tilgathpilneser, another king of Assyria. These kings decided to round up the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half of the Manasseh tribe. They took them all to places like Halah, Habor, Hara, and the river Gozan. And guess what? This happened a long time ago, but even to this day, those places still exist. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 51. Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he {was} the firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright. 2. For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him {came} the chief ruler; but the birthright {was} Joseph's:) {chief...: or, prince} 3.

And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned, {were} the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah, 8. And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon: {Shema: or, Shemaiah} 9. And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead. 10. And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east {land} of Gilead. {throughout...: Heb. upon all the face of the east} 11. And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan unto Salchah: 12. Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan. 13. And their brethren of the house of their fathers {were}, Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven. 14.

And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders. {their...: Heb. their goings forth} 17. All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel. 18. The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, {were} four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the war. {valiant...: Heb. sons of valour} 19. And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab. 20. And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that {were} with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him. 21. And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand. {took...: Heb. led captive} {men: Heb. souls of men} 22. For there fell down many slain, because the war {was} of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity. 23. And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon. 24.

And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them. 26. And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day. \n",

And Amram's kids were lit: Aaron, Moses, and Miriam. Aaron's boys were also in the fam: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 4. Eleazar had a kid named Phinehas, who had a kid named Abishua, 5.

The Levites were also chosen to do all sorts of tasks in God's house, alongside their fellow brothers. 49. So Aaron and his squad flexed on the burnt offering altar and the incense altar. They were chosen to handle all the sacred tasks and make things right for Israel, following Moses' orders like a true servant of God. 50. So here's a rundown of Aaron's kids: Eleazar, Phinehas, and Abishua, in that order. 51. Yo, Bukki was his dad, Uzzi was his bro, and Zerahiah was his homie, 52.

So, they randomly assigned cities from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, and these cities were known by their own names. 66. And the remaining families of the sons of Kohath had cities in their designated regions outside of the land given to the tribe of Ephraim. 67. And they were like, 'Here you go, dudes!

And there were groups of soldiers, dudes, from different families, consisting of 36k warriors. They were all ready to fight, bro. The reason why they had so many soldiers is 'cause they had lots of wives and sons, you know? 5. And their bros in all the fams of Issachar were straight up strong dudes, counted at an impressive 87K when you check out their family tree. 6. Here are the dudes from the tribe of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, and Jediael. Just three of 'em. 7. So Bela had five sons: Ezbon, Uzzi, Uzziel, Jerimoth, and Iri.

So Zabad had a son named Shuthelah, and Shuthelah had two sons named Ezer and Elead. These dudes from Gath messed with them and killed them because they tried to  steal their livestock. 22. And Ephraim, their dad, was really sad for a long time, and his brothers came to console him. 23. And when he hooked up with his wife, she got pregnant and had a baby boy. He named him Beriah because his family was going through tough times. 24. (And his daughter was Sherah, the one who built Bethhoron the lower city, the upper city, and Uzzensherah.) 25.

And Moza had a son named Binea; and Rephaiah was his son, followed by Eleasah and Azel. 44. So, Azel had six sons with, like, pretty cool names - Azrikam, Bocheru, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, and Hanan. Like, those were the sons of Azel. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 91. So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they {were} written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, {who} were carried away to Babylon for their transgression. 2. Now the first inhabitants that {dwelt} in their possessions in their cities {were}, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims. 3. And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh; 4. Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah. 5. And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons. 6. And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their brethren, six hundred and ninety. 7. And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah, 8. And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephathiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah; 9. And their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men {were} chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers. 10.

And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites. 17. And the porters {were}, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum {was} the chief; 18. Who hitherto {waited} in the king's gate eastward: they {were} porters in the companies of the children of Levi. 19. And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, {were} over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, {being} over the host of the LORD, {were} keepers of the entry. {gates: Heb. thresholds} 20. And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time past, {and} the LORD {was} with him. 21. {And} Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah {was} porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 22.

These chief fathers of the Levites {were} chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem. 35. And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name {was} Maachah: 36. And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and Nadab, 37. And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth. 38. And Mikloth begat Shimeam.

      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 101. So, like, the Philistines were totally fighting against Israel, right? And, well, the Israelite dudes ran away from them and ended up getting all wrecked on Mount Gilboa. It was like they either got seriously hurt or straight up killed, you know? Oops! 2. So, like, the Philistines were totally chasing Saul and his sons, and they actually killed Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, who were Saul's sons. By the way, Abinadab was also called Ishui. 3. Saul was totally losing the battle, and the archers straight up nailed him with their arrows, causing some serious wounds. 🔥 4. Saul turned to his loyal sidekick and said, 'Yo, grab your sword and take me out, before those uncircumcised losers get a chance to disrespect me.' But his sidekick was too scared and refused. So Saul grabbed a sword and ended it all himself. {mock me: like, make fun of me} 5. And when Saul's buddy saw that Saul was toast, he was like, 'I'm out too!' and offed himself with a sword. 6. Saul and his three sons, and everyone in his family, all passed away at the same time. 7. And like, when all the dudes of Israel who were chillin' in the valley peeped that they bounced, and that Saul and his sons bit the dust, they straight up left their cities and dipped. Then the Philistines swooped in and moved into those places. 8. The next day, when the Philistines came to loot the dead bodies, they discovered that Saul and his sons had been defeated on Mount Gilboa. 9. After taking off his clothes, they grabbed his head and armor and sent them to the Philistine territory to spread the news to their idols and the people. 10. So, like, they totally placed his armor in the crib of their gods, and secured his head in the VIP spot at the temple of Dagon. 11. And like, when everyone in Jabeshgilead found out what the Philistines did to Saul, 12. So, like, all the brave dudes got up and, you know, they took Saul's body and his sons' bodies, and they brought 'em over to Jabesh and buried their bones under this rad oak tree in Jabesh. And then they totally fasted for, like, a whole week. 13. Like, Saul totally faced the consequences for going against the LORD and not following His word. And, um, he even messed up by seeking advice from someone who was into weird, supernatural stuff. Yeah, it was a major transgression, you know? 14. And he didn't seek advice from the LORD, so he got killed, and the kingdom was given to David, Jesse's son. {Jesse: also known as Isai} \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 101. Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa. {slain: or, wounded} 2. And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul. {Abinadab: also called, Ishui} 3. And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers. {and the archers: Heb. and the shooters with bows} {hit: Heb. found} 4. Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. {abuse me: or, mock me} 5. And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died. 6. So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together. 7. And when all the men of Israel that {were} in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them. 8. And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa. 9. And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people. 10. And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon. 11. And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul, 12. They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days. 13. So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, {even} against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking {counsel} of {one that had} a familiar spirit, to enquire {of it}; {committed: Heb. transgressed} 14. And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse. {Jesse: Heb. Isai} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 111. So, all of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, 'Yo, check it out, we're like, your fam, bro.' 2. And like, dude, back in the day, when Saul was king and everything, you were the one who totally guided and brought Israel around. And the LORD, your God, was like, 'You're gonna take care of my people Israel and be their ruler and all.' 3. So, like, all the OGs of Israel went to the king in Hebron, and David totally made a pact with them in Hebron in front of the LORD. They even like anointed David as the king of Israel, just as the LORD said through Samuel.  4. So, like, David and all of Israel rolled up to Jerusalem, which was called Jebus at the time. And, guess what? The Jebusites, the OG peeps who lived there, were still chillin' in the land. 5. The peeps in Jebus were like, 'Nuh uh, David, you can't come here.' But David was like, 'Watch me, fam.' And he totally conquered Zion, which BTW is David's city. 6. David was like, 'Yo, whoever takes out the Jebusites first gets to be the leader and boss. So Joab, Zeruiah's son, stepped up and became the leader. 7. So David moved into the cool castle, and people started calling it the city of David. You know, like a boss. {it: like, yeah, that's what they mean by Zion} 8. And he totally built up the city, making it super fancy and all, starting from Millo and going all the way around. And Joab was the one who fixed up the rest of the city, you know, brought it back to life and made it all fresh again. {repaired: In the original Hebrew, it means revived, like a comeback.} 9. And David straight up leveled up like a boss: 'cause the big man upstairs had his back, no cap. #blessed 10. These were the top squad of David's homies who were total beasts and stood by him in his reign, along with all of Israel, to crown him as king, just like the LORD had foretold about Israel. (Or in other words, they were tight with him and had his back.) 11. So, like, David had a bunch of really strong dudes on his team. There's this one guy Jashobeam, he was like the head honcho of all the captains. And get this, he straight up took out 300 peeps with just his spear, all at once! (PS: Jashobeam was from this place called Hachmoni, if you wanted to know) 12. And then there was Eleazar, Dodo's son, from the Ahohite crew, who was one of the top three badasses. 13. He was hanging out with David at this place called Pasdammim, and guess what? The Philistines were all geared up for a huge battle. And get this - there was a spot filled with loads of barley nearby, but when the Philistines showed up, everyone dipped out real fast. 14. So they like, positioned themselves right in the middle of the area, and totally handled it, you know? They straight up defeated the Philistines! And God, like, came through big time and saved them in a major way. It was epic, man! 15. So, like, three of the coolest captains ever ventured down to where David was chilling, in this cave called Adullam, while the Philistine army camped out in the valley of Rephaim. You know, just your typical epic showdown situation. {three...: or, three captains over the thirty} 16. So David was chillin' in the crib, while the Philistines were posted up in Bethlehem. 17. David was like, man, I could really go for a sip of that water from the Bethlehem well by the gate! 18. Then, these three warriors went full beast mode on the Philistine squad, snatched some water from the well in Bethlehem right by the gate, and delivered it to David. But hold up, David refused to gulp it down and instead, he poured it out as an offering to the LORD. 19. And I was like, no way, God. I can't do that. Like, seriously? Should I actually drink the blood of these guys who risked their lives to get it? Nah, not happening. These three absolute legends made that choice. Like, they went all in, you know? 20. Abishai, Joab's bro, was like the boss of the three amigos. He straight up destroyed 300 peeps with his sick spear skills and became legendary among the crew. 21. Out of the three, he was, like, way more legit than the other two, 'cause he was their leader and everything. But, like, he didn't quite reach the same level as those top three, you know? 22. Yo, listen up! Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, was straight up legendary! He was from Kabzeel and had mad skills. Check it, he straight up took down two Moabite dudes who were as fierce as lions. And get this, he even went into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion! This guy was no joke, he had some serious skills, y'know? 23. So, this dude straight up took down a tall Egyptian guy who was like a giant, all while the Egyptian had this ridiculously huge spear in his hand. And get this, the dude didn't even use a weapon himself – he just took the spear right out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own weapon. Talk about a legendary move! 24. Benaiah, yo, he straight up pulled off these sick moves and became one of the top three badasses. 25. Yo, check it out, this dude had mad respect among the thirty, even though he didn't quite make it to the top three. David chose him to be in charge of his squad. 26. And there were some epic warriors in the army, like Asahel, who was Joab's bro, and Elhanan, Dodo's son from Bethlehem. 27. Shammoth, the ultimate Harorite, Helez, the top-notch Pelonite, Shammoth, the absolute legend, representing the Harorites, and Helez, the Pelonite who knows what's up 28. Ira, son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, and Abiezer the Antothite, 29. Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, Sibbecai, also known as Mebunnai, and Ilai, also known as Zalmon 30. Maharai from Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah from Netophathite, {Heled: or, Heleb} 31. Ithai, Ribai's kid from Gibeah, repping the Benjamin fam, Benaiah, the Pirathon squad, 32.

Bruh, Ahiam, son of Sacar the Hararite, and Eliphal, son of Ur, also known as Sharar and Eliphelet, or Ahasbai. 36. Hepher the Supplier from Mecherath, Ahijah the Chill Pelonite, 37. Hezro from Carmel, Naarai, Ezbai's son, (also known as Hezrai and Paarai the Arbite) 38. Joel, Nathan's bro, Mibhar (Haggeri's kid), 39. Zelek, the cool Ammonite dude, Naharai, the awesome Berothite, Joab's battle buddy who carried his armor. Joab is Zeruiah's son, by the way. 40. Ira from the Ithrite crew, Gareb from the Ithrite crew, 41. Uriah the Hittite, Zabad, Ahlai's kiddo, 42. Adina, Shiza's son, was a total boss among the Reubenites.

      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 111. Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we {are} thy bone and thy flesh. 2. And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou {wast} he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel. {in time...: Heb. both yesterday and the third day} {feed: or, rule} 3. Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel. {by: Heb. by the hand of} 4. And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which {is} Jebus; where the Jebusites {were}, the inhabitants of the land. 5. And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which {is} the city of David. 6. And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief. {chief: Heb. head} 7. And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David. {it: that is, Zion} 8. And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city. {repaired: Heb. revived} 9. So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts {was} with him. {waxed...: Heb. went in going and increasing} 10. These also {are} the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, {and} with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. {strengthened...: or, held strongly with him} 11. And this {is} the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain {by him} at one time. {an Hachmonite: or, son of Hachmoni} 12. And after him {was} Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who {was one} of the three mighties. 13. He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines. {Pasdammim: also called, Ephesdammim} 14. And they set themselves in the midst of {that} parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved {them} by a great deliverance. {set...: or, stood} {deliverance: or, salvation} 15. Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim. {three...: or, three captains over the thirty} 16. And David {was} then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison {was} then at Bethlehem. 17. And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that {is} at the gate! 18. And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that {was} by the gate, and took {it}, and brought {it} to David: but David would not drink {of} it, but poured it out to the LORD, 19. And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with {the jeopardy of} their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest. {that have...: Heb. with their lives?} 20. And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew {them}, and had a name among the three. 21.

And he slew an Egyptian, a man of {great} stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian's hand {was} a spear like a weaver's beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear. {great...: Heb. measure} 24.

      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 121. So, like, these were the homies who came to chill with David in Ziklag, you know? At that time, he was low-key hiding from Saul, Kish's son, 'cause things were getting intense. And let me tell you, these dudes were straight up badasses, always ready to throw down on the battlefield. (By the way, David was still laying low while this was going down, just so you know.) 2. They were totally equipped with epic bows, and could skillfully use both right hand and left hand to yeet stones and shoot arrows like a boss. These warriors were not just anyone, they were Saul's homies from the sick tribe of Benjamin. 3. The top dudes were Ahiezer, Joash, Shemaah's sons from Gibeath; and Jeziel, Pelet, Azmaveth's sons; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite, kinda like Shemaah was also known as Hasmaah. 4. Yo, Ismaiah from Gibeon was a total boss, part of the elite thirty crew. We also had Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite holding it down. 5. Yo, Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite, stayin' real tight. 6. Elkanah, Jesiah, Azareel, Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites, were all homies. 7. And there were these dudes named Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from the town Gedor. 8. Some of the Gadites, strong and fierce warriors, joined David in the wilderness. They were expert in wielding shields and bucklers, with faces like lions and swift as mountain deer. They were ready for battle, swift as the wind. 9. Ezer was up first, then Obadiah came through, followed by Eliab in third place, 10. Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 11. Then there was Attai, the bro who came in sixth place, and Eliel, the dude who took the seventh spot. 12. Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 13. Jeremiah 10, Machbanai 11. 14. These guys from the Gad crew were the bomb! They were the big bosses in charge of the gang, with the weakest one leading a hundred soldiers, and the strongest one commanding a thousand troops. It's like the weakling could take on a hundred by himself, and the boss could handle a whole army of a thousand. Talk about some seriously powerful leaders! 15. These were the ones who crossed over the river Jordan in the beginning of the year when it was totally flooded; they defeated all the people in the surrounding areas, both to the east and to the west. 16. And some of the kids from Benjamin and Judah joined up with David at the HQ. 17. So David went out to meet them and said, if you all are here in peace to support me, then we'll be like besties. But if your intentions are to betray me to my enemies, even though I haven't done anything wrong, I hope the God of our ancestors takes notice and gives you a good scolding. 18. And Amasai, the head captain, was filled with the spirit. He said to David, 'We're with you, bro! You're the son of Jesse, fam. May peace and blessings be with you and your squad, because God's got your back!' David welcomed them and appointed them as top captains in his crew. 19. Some of the people from Manasseh joined David when he fought against Saul with the Philistines. But they didn't actually help him because the Philistine leaders thought David might turn against them and cause trouble for all of us. 20. As he headed towards Ziklag, he got some solid backup from the Manasseh crew. Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad (yup, another one), Elihu, and Zilthai, all leading thousands of warriors from Manasseh were there to support him. 21. And they totally had David's back against those rovers, because all of them were super strong and brave dudes, and they were like the leaders of the squad. #teamwork #battlebros 22. So like, every day during that time, a bunch of people came to David's aid, and it got to be a huge army, just as massive as God's own army. 23. So, here's the rundown of the badass crew that suited up for war and joined David in Hebron. Their mission? To snatch the kingdom from Saul and give it to David, just like the LORD said. (And by crew, I mean the top dogs, the leaders, or some might say, the heads.) 24. There were 6,800 fierce warriors from the tribe of Judah, fully equipped with shields and spears, totally ready for battle. They were absolutely prepared to fight. 25. Among the Simeon squad, there were a total of 7,100 fierce warriors ready to conquer any battle. 26. There were, like, 4,600 peeps from the Levi crew. 27. Jehoiada was the boss of the Aaronites, and he had a squad of three thousand and seven hundred with him. 28. And Zadok, this young dude who's seriously brave, and from his dad's fam, there were twenty-two total boss captains. 29. There were three thousand kids from the Benjamin fam, Saul's peeps, 'cause most of 'em were still loyal to Saul's crib. (kindred means brethren and the greatest... means a bunch of 'em) 30. There were like 20k+ epic warriors from the Ephraim fam, all famous in their clans. They were totally known for their bravery and skills. #legends 31. So, like, 18k dudes from, like, the half tribe of Manasseh, they were all, like, individually, like, chosen and stuff to come and, like, help make David the king. 32. There were some really smart peeps from the tribe of Issachar who were totally in the know about what was up in their time. They were like the bosses with a crew of two hundred leaders, and everyone else was totally down to follow their orders. 33. In the tribe of Zebulun, there were some super skilled warriors who joined the battle with all their epic war gadgets. There were a whopping fifty thousand of them who knew how to fight strategically and stay organized. And here's the cool part - they were totally dedicated, no faking it here. No indecisiveness, they were all in, giving their absolute best! 34. Naphtali brought together a full squad of a thousand leaders, and alongside them wielding shields and spears were thirty-seven thousand warriors. 35. And the Danites, skilled in battle, amounted to 28,600 warriors. 36. And in the tribe of Asher, there were forty thousand skilled warriors who knew all the tricks of the battlefield. They were like squad goals, always keeping their ranks organized and on fleek. 37. On the flip side of the Jordan River, there were the Reubenites, Gadites, and half of the Manasseh tribe. They came strapped with all kinds of weapons, ready for battle. There were a whopping 120,000 of them! 38. All these badass warriors who know what's up, rolled up to Hebron with their whole heart, ready to crown David as king over all Israel. And you guessed it, the rest of Israel were totally on board too, all united in making David their king. 39. So David and his friends hung out for three days, grubbing on some good food and drinks. It was a sweet setup organized by their own siblings. 40. And those who were close by, including Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, brought lots of food and drinks like bread, fig cakes, raisins, wine, and oil. They had plenty of oxen and sheep too. Everyone in Israel was super happy about it! \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 121. Now these {are} they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they {were} among the mighty men, helpers of the war. {while...: Heb. being yet shut up} 2. {They were} armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in {hurling} stones and {shooting} arrows out of a bow, {even} of Saul's brethren of Benjamin. 3. The chief {was} Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite, {Shemaah: or, Hasmaah} 4. And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite, 5.

And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. 8. And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, {and} men of war {fit} for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces {were like} the faces of lions, and {were} as swift as the roes upon the mountains; {of war: Heb. of the host} {as swift...: Heb. as the roes upon the mountains to make haste} 9.

These {were} of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least {was} over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand. {one...: or, one that was least could resist an hundred, and the greatest a thousand} 15. These {are} they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all {them} of the valleys, {both} toward the east, and toward the west. {overflown: Heb. filled over} 16. And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto David. 17. And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if {ye be come} to betray me to mine enemies, seeing {there is} no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look {thereon}, and rebuke {it}. {to meet...: Heb. before them} {be knit: Heb. be one} {wrong: or, violence} 18. Then the spirit came upon Amasai, {who was} chief of the captains, {and he said}, Thine {are we}, David, and on thy side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace {be} unto thee, and peace {be} to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received them, and made them captains of the band. {came...: Heb. clothed} 19. And there fell {some} of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to {the jeopardy of} our heads. {to the...: Heb. on our heads} 20. As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that {were} of Manasseh. 21. And they helped David against the band {of the rovers}: for they {were} all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host. {against...: or, with a band} 22. For at {that} time day by day there came to David to help him, until {it was} a great host, like the host of God. 23. And these {are} the numbers of the bands {that were} ready armed to the war, {and} came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD. {bands: or, captains, or, men: Heb. heads} 24. The children of Judah that bare shield and spear {were} six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war. {armed: or, prepared} 25. Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred. 26. Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred. 27. And Jehoiada {was} the leader of the Aaronites, and with him {were} three thousand and seven hundred; 28. And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains. 29. And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul. {kindred: Heb. brethren} {the greatest...: Heb. a multitude of them} 30. And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers. {famous: Heb. men of names} 31. And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king. 32. And of the children of Issachar, {which were men} that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them {were} two hundred; and all their brethren {were} at their commandment. 33. Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: {they were} not of double heart. {expert...: or, rangers of battle, or, ranged in battle} {keep...: or, set the battle in array} {not...: Heb. without a heart and a heart} 34. And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand. 35. And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred. 36.

And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand. 38. All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel {were} of one heart to make David king. 39. And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them. 40. Moreover they that were nigh them, {even} unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, {and} meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for {there was} joy in Israel. {meat...: or, victual of meal} \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 131. So David talked to the heads of thousands and hundreds, and to all the important peeps. 2. And David was like, yo, to all the peeps of Israel, if you're down with this and it's all from the Lord our God, let's reach out to our bros and sis everywhere, who are still left in the whole land of Israel, and get the priests and Levites too, in their cities and even nearby, so they can all come together with us. Let's make it happen! 3. Yo, let's bring back our God's ark, 'cause we never even bothered asking 'bout it back in Saul's time. #BringItBack 4. And everyone in the group agreed to do it because it seemed like a good idea to everyone. 5. So David called all of Israel to gather up, from Shihor of Egypt all the way to the entrance of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim. 6. So David and all of Israel went to Baalah, which is also known as Kirjathjearim, in the land of Judah. Their mission was to bring back the ark of God the LORD, which is chilling out between the cherubims and has its name written on it. 7. So they took the ark of God and put it on a brand new cart from the crib of Abinadab. Uzza and Ahio were in charge of driving the cart. #smoothride 8. So David and all his squad in Israel went all out, jamming before God with max energy. They were rocking it with epic singing, strumming the harps, smashing the psalteries, banging the timbrels, crashing the cymbals, and blasting the trumpets. (singing: Hebrew for songs) 9. So when they got to the place called Chidon, Uzza reached out his hand to steady the ark because the oxen tripped. (Chidon was also known as Nachon.) (Tripped: or, gave it a shake) 10. God got really angry at Uzza when he touched the ark, so He struck him and Uzza died right there in front of Him. 11. David was super upset because the LORD caused a big problem with Uzza, so they named that place Perezuzza, which means the big problem with Uzza, and people still call it that today. 12. So David was like totally shooketh by God that day and was like, yo how am I gonna bring the ark of God to my crib? 13. So David didn't bring the ark to his crib in the city of David, but instead took it to the crib of Obededom the Gittite. 14. So like, the God's ark stayed with Obededom's fam in their crib for a solid three months. And man, the big man upstairs totally blessed Obededom's house and everything he owned, no cap. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 131. And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, {and} with every leader. 2. And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If {it seem} good unto you, and {that it be} of the LORD our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, {that are} left in all the land of Israel, and with them {also} to the priests and Levites {which are} in their cities {and} suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us: {send...: Heb. break forth and send} {in their...: Heb. in the cities of their suburbs} 3. And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at it in the days of Saul. {bring...: Heb. bring about} 4. And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people. 5. So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim. 6. And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, {that is}, to Kirjathjearim, which {belonged} to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth {between} the cherubims, whose name is called {on it}. 7. And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart. {carried...: Heb. made the ark to ride} 8. And David and all Israel played before God with all {their} might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets. {singing: Heb. songs} 9. And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. {Chidon: also called Nachon} {stumbled: or, shook it} 10. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God. 11. And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this day. {Perezuzza: that is, The breach of Uzza} 12. And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God {home} to me? 13. So David brought not the ark {home} to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. {brought: Heb. removed} 14. And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 141. So this dude named Hiram, who was like the king of Tyre, sent his messengers to David. They brought along some high-quality cedar wood and a bunch of skilled workers - masons and carpenters - to help build David a sick crib. 2. And David was like, 'Dude, I can totally tell that God has totally approved me as the king of Israel, 'cause my kingdom is on fire and everyone's got my back, especially the awesome people of Israel.' 3. So David, like, totally married more girls in Jerusalem and had, like, a bunch more kids. #familygoals #expandingthefam 4. So, these are the names of the kids this dude had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon. 5. Yo, there's Ibhar, Elishua, and Elpalet. They're part of the crew. 6. And like, there were Nogah, Nepheg, and Japhia, ya know. 7. And there were these guys named Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphalet. Oh, and by the way, Beeliada was also known as Eliada. 8. So, like, when the Philistines found out that David was crowned the king of all Israel, they were all like, 'Let's go after David!' And David, being the boss that he is, heard about it and was like, 'I'm not gonna back down.' So he went out to face them head-on, no fear. 9. So, like, the Philistines showed up and, you know, posted up in the valley of Rephaim. 10. So David asked God, like, 'Yo, should I take on the Philistines? And will you, like, totally hand them over to me?' And the LORD straight up replied, 'Yeah, go for it! I got your back, man. I'll totally deliver them to you.' 11. So they went to Baalperazim, and David totally owned them there. And David was like, 'Dude, God just wrecked my enemies through me, it was like a tidal wave or something!' That's why they named that place Baalperazim, which means a place of total destruction. 12. And once they ditched their idols, David was like, 'Yo, let's torch 'em up!' So that's exactly what happened - those false gods went up in flames. 13. And the Philistines went out everywhere in the valley once more. 14. So David checked in with God once more, and God told him, 'Don't follow them directly. Move in a different direction, and ambush them near the mulberry trees.' 15. When you hear the sound of movement in the mulberry trees, that's your cue to head out and fight. God is leading the way to give the Philistines a good whacking! 16. So David did what God told him to do and they totally wrecked the army of the Philistines from Gibeon all the way to Gazer. (Gibeon was also known as Geba, just fyi) 17. David was, like, super famous, and everyone was totally scared of him because the Lord made him, like, really intimidating to all the nations. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 141. Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house. 2. And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel. 3. And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters. {more: Heb. yet} 4. Now these {are} the names of {his} children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 5. And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, 6. And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 7. And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet. {Beeliada: also called, Eliada} 8. And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard {of it}, and went out against them. 9. And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 10. And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. 11. So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim. {Baalperazim: that is, A place of breaches} 12. And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire. 13. And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. 14. Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. 15. And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, {that} then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. 16. David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. {Gibeon: also called, Geba} 17. And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 151. So, like, David built some sick cribs in the city of David and set up a lit spot for the ark of God, like a dope tent and stuff. 2. So David was like, nobody should be carrying the ark of God except the Levites because the LORD chose them specifically to carry the ark and serve Him forever. Like, it's totally not cool for anyone else to carry it, only the Levites. 3. So David gathered everyone in Israel and they all came to Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the LORD to its rightful spot that he had set up. 4. So David brought together the squad of Aaron's kids and the Levites: 5. Among Kohath's crew were Uriel, the top dog, and his squad of 120 homies. 6. Among Merari's squad, there was Asaiah holding it down as the leader with his two hundred and twenty homies. 7. Among the guys from Gershom crew, we got Joel leading the pack with his squad of one hundred and thirty homies: 8. Among Elizaphan's crew, Shemaiah was the top dog with his two hundred accomplices. 9. Among Hebron's sons were Eliel, the leader, and his eighty brothers: 10. Among Uzziel's squad, Amminadab was the boss and he had a tight crew of 112 homies. 11. So David hit up Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and also the Levites: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. 12. And he told them, you guys are like the top leaders of the Levites: make yourselves pure, along with your buddies, so that you can bring the ark of the LORD God of Israel to the spot that I've set up for it. 13. Yo, 'cause y'all didn't do it right from the get-go, the LORD our God straight up brought some consequences upon us 'cause we didn't even bother to seek Him in the proper way. 14. So the priests and the Levites got themselves ready to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. 15. So, the Levite kids totally carried the ark of God on their shoulders using those cool poles, just like Moses told them to do, all in line with what the LORD said! 16. So David talked to the head of the Levites, telling them to bring in their fellow Levites to be the sickest singers ever. Like, they gotta rock the stage with music instruments - psalteries, harps, and cymbals - making awesome sounds while belting out their voices in pure joy. 17. The Levites chose Heman, son of Joel, to fulfill their role. Asaph, son of Berechiah, was also selected among his fellow Levites. And Ethan, son of Kushaiah, was chosen from the sons of Merari, their brothers. 18. And hanging out with them were their bros from the second level, like Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the ones in charge of keeping it cool at the entrance. 19. So they chose Heman, Asaph, and Ethan as the singers to play the rad brass cymbals. 20. And Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were vibin' on their psalteries, like, super high-key on Alamoth. 21. And Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obededom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were rockin' it on the Sheminith with their sick harps, totally slaying the music game. #TalentOverflow #EighthWonder 22. Chenaniah, the head Levite, was the one in charge of the beats and tunes. He knew all the sick jams and helped teach others how to bring the musical heat. Dude had some serious skills, no doubt about it.  23. So Berechiah and Elkanah were like the bouncers for the ark, keeping it safe and sound. 24. And Shebaniah, Jehoshaphat, Nethaneel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, were hyping up the crowd with their trumpet skills in front of the ark of God. Obededom and Jehiah were the boss bouncers guarding the entrance to the ark. 25. So David, the OGs of Israel, and the squad leaders, were hyped to go fetch the ark of the LORD's covenant from Obededom's crib. It was pure joy vibes all the way. 26. So, like, when God was totally there for the Levites who were, like, carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD, they, like, sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams, you know? 27. David was wearing a sick robe made of fancy linen, and all the Levites who carried the ark, along with the singers and the boss music guy Chenaniah: David was also rocking a linen ephod. 28. So, like, all the Israel peeps were super hyped and excited and totally brought up the ark of the LORD's covenant with tons of noise! They were shouting, and playing cornets, trumpets, and cymbals, and jamming out on psalteries and harps. It was lit! 29. So, when the special box of God's promises arrived in David's city, this lady named Michal, who happened to be Saul's daughter, spotted King David dancing and having a good time through her window. And honestly, she totally looked down on him deep down inside. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 151. And {David} made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 2. Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever. {None...: Heb. It is not to carry the ark of God, but for the Levites} 3. And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it. 4. And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 5. Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty: {brethren: or, kinsmen} 6. Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty: 7. Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty: 8.

Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve. 11. And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, 12. And said unto them, Ye {are} the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, {both} ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto {the place that} I have prepared for it. 13. For because ye {did it} not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. 14. So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel. 15. And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD. 16. And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren {to be} the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. 17. So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 18. And with them their brethren of the second {degree}, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters. 19.

And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah {were} doorkeepers for the ark. 25. So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy. 26. And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. 27. And David {was} clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also {had} upon him an ephod of linen. {song: or, carriage} 28. Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps. 29. And it came to pass, {as} the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 161. So they brought the ark of God and put it right in the middle of the tent that David had set up. Then they made some sick burnt sacrifices and peace offerings in front of God. 2. Once David finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. 3. And he gave everyone in Israel, both guys and girls, a loaf of bread, a juicy chunk of meat, and a bottle of wine. 4. So he picked some of the Levites to serve before the ark of the LORD, and to keep records, and to give thanks and praise to the LORD God of Israel: 5. So Asaph, the leader, had Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, and Obededom right there beside him. Jeiel played the psalteries and harps, while Asaph rocked the cymbals. 6. Benaiah and Jahaziel, the dope priests, were straight up jammin' on their trumpets 24/7 right in front of the holy ark of God's covenant. 7. So, like, on that day, David gave Asaph and his bros this sick psalm to thank the LORD, you know? 8. Yo, praise the LORD! Hit him up, spread the word about all the awesome stuff he's done. 9. Like, jam out and sing to Him, vibe with some sick psalms, and just chat about all the epic things He's done. 10. Praise his holy name and let the hearts of those who seek the LORD be filled with joy. 11. Keep vibin' with the LORD and level up your inner strength, stay constantly connected with his presence. 12. Yo, don't forget all them amazing things He's done, just think 'bout His mind-blowing miracles and the way He's spoken with authority. 13. Yo, descendants of Israel - God's loyal crew, children of Jacob, His hand-picked squad. 14. He's like, the ultimate boss, the LORD our God, and his judgments are like everywhere, man. 15. Always remember his promise; the message he passed down for a thousand generations; 16. The promise God made to Abraham and his commitment to Isaac, 17. And has solidified the same thing for Jacob, making it a firm law, and for Israel, an eternal agreement. 18. I promise to hook you up with the land of Canaan, it's gonna be your inheritance and all, for real 19. Back when there were only a handful of you, just a small group, and you didn't really know your way around. 20. So, like, they were traveling around, going from one nation to another, and from kingdom to different people, you know? 21. He didn't let anyone harm them: yeah, he called out kings for their sake, 22. Don't mess with my chosen ones, and don't cause trouble for my prophets. 23. Yo, let's all vibe and sing praise to the LORD, fam! Every day, let's flex and spread the word about how He saves us. 24. Spread the word about how awesome God is to all the people around the world; let everyone know about the incredible things He has done. 25. OMG, the LORD is like totally awe-inspiring and deserves, like, mad props. He's legit the most fearsome of all the gods, hands down. 26. Like, all those gods that people are into? They're totally fake, just like idols or whatever. But, yo, the LORD, He's the real deal. He's the one who created the whole freakin' universe. 27. His presence is lit with glory and honor; his place is all about flexing strength and feeling the good vibes. 28. Yo, everyone out there, show some love to the LORD, like for real, give Him all the props and power He deserves. 29. Show mad respect to the LORD, give him all the props he deserves: bring your offering and come to him, worship the LORD with all your pure vibes. 30. Yo, everyone better be shook in front of Him, all over the globe. The whole world better stay lit and steady, not even thinking about getting out of place. 31. Yo, the skies be lit and the earth be hype, and let everyone spread the word to all the nations, the LORD is the real deal. 32. Yo, the ocean be wildin', making all them big waves and stuff. And yo, the fields be straight up lit, celebrating with all the things in it. 33. The trees in the forest gonna be lit AF when the LORD shows up to drop some righteous judgment on earth. 34. Yo, let's show some gratitude to the LORD 'cause he's straight up good and his mercy's like forever lasting, bro. 35. And like, yo, we're like, 'Save us, God, the real MVP of our salvation, and bring us all together, and rescue us from those who don't know what's up, so we can be grateful for your holy name and flex in your praises. 36. Praise the Lord God of Israel forever and ever! And everybody was like, Amen and praised the Lord. 37. So he bounced out of there, with Asaph and his squad, to SAUCE it up before the ark of the LORD, serving non-stop like it's his 9 to 5 hustle: 38. And Obededom and their squad, sixty-eight cool dudes; Obededom, son of Jeduthun, and Hosah were the gatekeepers too. 39. So Zadok the priest and his fellow priests were doing their thing in front of the LORD's tabernacle, which was at this fancy spot called Gibeon. 40. To keep the vibes high, you gotta burn those offerings on the altar like all the time, in the morning and evening. And make sure you follow all the rules that the LORD gave to Israel in His law, no exceptions. Gotta start the day and end it right, you know. 41. And there were these cool cat musicians called Heman and Jeduthun, and a bunch of other awesome peeps, specially picked for the job. They were totally named and everything, so they could give mad props and shout-outs to the LORD, who's like all about showing mercy that never ends. It's lit, yo! 42. And Heman and Jeduthun were there too, rocking the trumpets and cymbals, creating those sick beats alongside their lit musical instruments. Oh, and Jeduthun's homies were the gatekeepers, you feel? 43. And everyone went back to their homes, and David went back to bless his own crib. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 161. So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. 2. And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. 3. And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon {of wine}. 4. And he appointed {certain} of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel: 5. Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; {with psalteries...: Heb. with instruments of psalteries and harps} 6. Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God. 7. Then on that day David delivered first {this psalm} to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 8. Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. 9. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works. 10. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD. 11. Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually. 12. Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; 13. O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. 14. He {is} the LORD our God; his judgments {are} in all the earth. 15. Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word {which} he commanded to a thousand generations; 16. {Even of the covenant} which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac; 17. And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, {and} to Israel {for} an everlasting covenant, 18. Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance; {the lot: Heb. the cord} 19. When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. {few, even: Heb. men of number, etc} 20. And {when} they went from nation to nation, and from {one} kingdom to another people; 21. He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes, 22. {Saying}, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 23. Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation. 24. Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations. 25. For great {is} the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also {is} to be feared above all gods. 26. For all the gods of the people {are} idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 27. Glory and honour {are} in his presence; strength and gladness {are} in his place. 28. Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength. 29. Give unto the LORD the glory {due} unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 30. Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved. 31. Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let {men} say among the nations, The LORD reigneth. 32. Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that {is} therein. 33. Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth. 34. O give thanks unto the LORD; for {he is} good; for his mercy {endureth} for ever. 35. And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, {and} glory in thy praise. 36. Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD. 37. So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required: 38. And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah {to be} porters: 39. And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that {was} at Gibeon, 40. To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and {to do} according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; {morning...: Heb. in the morning, and in the evening} 41. And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy {endureth} for ever; 42. And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun {were} porters. {porters: Heb. for the gate} 43. And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 171. So, like, David was chilling in his crib, and he’s like, 'Yo, Nathan the prophet, listen up. I’m living in this dope cedar house, but the Lord's covenant box is still covered up.' 2. So Nathan was like, Davidd, go ahead and do whatever you want, 'cause God's got your back, bro.' 3. So like, that very night, God spoke to Nathan and was like, 4. Yo, go run up to David, my main servant, and drop this message: The LORD said, don't even think about building a crib for me to chill in, ya feel? 5. You know, I haven't really settled down in a fancy house ever since the day I brought Israel up. I've been going with the flow, moving from tent to tent, and hopping from one tabernacle to another. Just living life on the move, you know? 6. Whenever I've been hangin' with all of Israel, I never dropped a hint to any of the leaders I appointed to take care of my people, like yo, why haven't you built me a sick crib made of fancy cedars? 7. So like, tell my dude David this, the big man upstairs, the LORD of hosts, picked you up from shepherding sheep and stuff, like you were just chilling with the sheep fam, and now you're gonna be the bossman over my peeps in Israel.

But I'm gonna chill with him in my crib and my kingdom forever, and his throne will be on point for all eternity. 15. After hearing all of these words and seeing everything in this vision, Nathan straight-up went to David and was like, 'Listen up, bro!' 16. Yo, King David pulled up and sat down in front of the LORD and was like, 'Bruh, who even am I, God? And why you bringin' me this far with all this success? Like, what's the deal?' 17. But, like, God, you know, this was no big deal to you; because you’ve, like, totally talked about blessing my family for, like, ever and treated me with mad respect, like I'm some important person, dude, oh my Lord God. 18.

      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 171. Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the LORD {remaineth} under curtains. 2. Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that {is} in thine heart; for God {is} with thee. 3. And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying, 4. Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in: 5. For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from {one} tabernacle {to another}. {have gone: Heb. have been} 6. Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars? 7. Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, {even} from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: {from following: Heb. from after} 8. And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that {are} in the earth. 9. Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, 10. And since the time that I commanded judges {to be} over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house. 11. And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go {to be} with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 12. He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever. 13. I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took {it} from {him} that was before thee: 14. But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. 15. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. 16. And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who {am} I, O LORD God, and what {is} mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 17. And {yet} this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast {also} spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God. 18. What can David {speak} more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. 19. O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all {these} great things. {great...: Heb. greatnesses} 20. O LORD, {there is} none like thee, neither {is there any} God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 21. And what one nation in the earth {is} like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem {to be} his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? 22. For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God. 23. Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. 24. Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts {is} the God of Israel, {even} a God to Israel: and {let} the house of David thy servant {be} established before thee. 25. For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found {in his heart} to pray before thee. {hast...: Heb. hast revealed the ear of thy servant} 26. And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: 27.

      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 181. So, like, after that, David totally destroyed the Philistines, you know? He totally dominated them and conquered Gath along with its cities, snatching them away from those Philistines. 2. And he totally crushed Moab; and the Moabites ended up being David's loyal followers, and they even started sending him mad gifts. 3. And David totally wrecked Hadarezer, king of Zobah, all the way to Hamath. He was just out there trying to secure his power by the river Euphrates, you know? #NoMercy #ConqueringGoals #RiversideVibes 4. So David totally flexed and snatched a thousand sick chariots, along with seven thousand dope horsemen and twenty thousand lit foot soldiers. David was so savage, he even disabled all the horses that pulled the chariots, except for a hundred, which he kept for his own. #boss 5. So, like, when the Syrians from Damascus tried to backup Hadarezer, the king of Zobah, David totally destroyed them and took out a whopping twenty-two thousand men. {Damascus: which is, like, Hebrew for Darmesek} 6. So David stationed some of his people in Syriadamascus, and the Syrians became loyal to David, bringing him gifts. The LORD protected David wherever he went. 7. So David snagged those golden shields from Hadarezer's crew and flexed them all the way to Jerusalem. 8. And David got a ton of brass from Tibhath and Chun, these cities belonging to Hadarezer. Solomon used that brass to make the huge bronze sea, as well as the pillars and other brass stuff. (By the way, Tibhath is also called Betah in the book of Samuel, just so you know!) 9. So like, when King Tou of Hamath found out that David totally wrecked the entire army of King Hadarezer of Zobah, who by the way is also known as Toi... 10. He sent Hadoram, his son, to king David to check up on him and give him props because he totally wrecked Hadarezer in battle (Hadarezer was fighting against Tou, by the way). Oh, and David took all kinds of fancy gold, silver, and bronze stuff as well. (BTW, Hadoram is also called Joram. And by 'check up on him' I mean 'salute' and by 'props' I mean blesss'. Got it? Cool!) 11. King David hooked up the LORD with all that cash money he flexed from conquering Edom, Moab, Ammon, Philistines, and Amalek. 😎💰 12. Also, Abishai, Zeruiah's son, totally demolished 18,000 Edomites in the super salty valley. (Abishai is the same as Abshai, btw) 13. So, like, David set up these garrisons in Edom and all the Edomites totally became his servants. It's pretty wild, but the LORD was totally keeping David safe wherever he went. 14. So David was in charge of everything in Israel, making sure things were fair and just for all his peeps. 15. Joab, Zeruiah's son, was in charge of the squad, and Jehoshaphat, Ahilud's son, was the official record-keeper. (Or you could say 'remembrancer' if you're feeling fancy.) 16. So, there were these dudes named Zadok (Ahitub's son) and Abimelech (Abiathar's son) who were the priests. And there's this other guy called Shavsha who was the scribe. Just a side note, Abimelech was also known as Ahimelech and Shavsha went by Seraiah or Shisha too. 17. Benaiah, Jehoiada's kid, was in charge of the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And David's sons were the main squad supporting the king. Like, they had his back 24/7. #loyalty \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 181. Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines. 2. And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, {and} brought gifts. 3. And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates. {Hadarezer: or, Hadadezer} 4. And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot {horses}, but reserved of them an hundred chariots. {seven...: or, seven hundred} 5. And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. {Damascus: Heb. Darmesek} 6. Then David put {garrisons} in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, {and} brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. 7. And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 8. Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. {Tibhath...: called in the book of Samuel Betah, and Berothai} 9. Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; {Tou: also called, Toi} 10. He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and {with him} all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. {Hadoram: also called, Joram} {to enquire...: or, to salute} {to congratulate: Heb. to bless} {had war: Heb. was the man of wars} 11. Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all {these} nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. 12. Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. {Abishai: Heb. Abshai} 13. And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. 14. So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. 15. And Joab the son of Zeruiah {was} over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder. {recorder: or, remembrancer} 16. And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, {were} the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; {Abimelech: also called, Ahimelech} {Shavsha: also called Seraiah or Shisha} 17.

      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 191. So yeah, after a while, Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, chilled and passed away, and his son took over as the new ruler. 2. David was like, 'I'm gonna be nice to Hanun, Nahash's son, 'cause his dad was cool to me. So David sent his squad to give Hanun some comfort about his old man. And these David's peeps went to the land of the Ammonites to chill with Hanun and make him feel better. 3. Yo, the rulers of the Ammonites straight up told Hanun, like, do you actually think that David is honoring your pops by sending his peeps to bring you comfort? Nah fam, his crew came to scope things out, plot some moves, and spy on the land, ya know? 4. So, Hanun decided to mess with David's crew, and he totally gave them an embarrassing makeover. He shaved their heads, trimmed their clothes right near their backside, and then just sent them off. 5. So, like, some people went and told David how these guys were treated. And he was like, 'Dude, send a message to them that I want to meet them.' 'Cause these guys were totally embarrassed, you know? And the king was like, 'Yo, chill in Jericho until your beards grow back and then come back.' 6. So, like, when the peeps from Ammon realized that they were, like, totally annoying to David, Hanun and the Ammonites decided to send, get this, a thousand talents of silver to hire, like, chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, Syriamaachah, and Zobah. BTW, 'odious' means to stink in Hebrew, just an FYI. 7. They like, got like, thirty-two thousand chariots and stuff, along with the king of Maachah and his peeps. They all rolled up to Medeba and set up camp. And then the Ammon peeps from their cities all joined up and got ready for battle. 8. So, when David found out about it, he was like, 'Yo Joab, assemble the squad of the absolute legends.' 9. So like, the Ammon kids came out and got into battle formation in front of the city gate. And the kings who arrived were just chilling by themselves in the field. 10. So, like, Joab realized that the battle was, like, totally going against him from all sides. But he was, like, super smart and picked the best dudes from Israel to fight against the Syrians. It was, like, a real face-off, you know? Like, the cream of the crop fighting it out! 11. Then he gave the remaining people to his brother, Abishai, and together they prepared to face the children of Ammon in battle. 12. And he was like, if the Syrians are, like, totally overpowering me, then you better come through and help me out. But if the peeps from Ammon are, like, too strong for you, then I got your back, fam. 13. Stay strong and let's show our bravery for our crew and for the lit cities of our God. And let the LORD do whatever he thinks is dope. 🙌 14. So Joab and his squad rolled up on the Syrians ready to throw down, and the Syrians straight up dipped outta there before they even knew what hit 'em. 15. So, like, the Ammonites saw that the Syrians were all running away, and they were like, 'Nah, we better run too!' And they went into the city. And then Joab went back to Jerusalem, you know? 16. So, like, when the Syrians realized that they were totally losing to Israel, they decided to send messengers and bring forth the Syrians from across the river. And this dude Shophach, who was the captain of Hadarezer's army, he like led them and stuff. By the way, when I say 'river,' I mean the Euphrates River. And just a heads up, Shophach is also called Shobach, in case you were wondering! 17. So, like, David heard the news and was like, 'No way!' He assembled the whole squad of Israel and crossed the Jordan River to confront them. And he totally prepared himself for battle, you know, setting everything up. When the time came, David and his crew went head-to-head with the Syrians, and it was an epic clash! 18. Yo, the Syrians ran away when Israel came through. David straight up took down 7K Syrian soldiers riding in chariots, and 40K infantry troops. He even got rid of Shophach, the captain of their whole army. 19. And when Hadarezer's servants saw that they were totally losing to Israel, they decided to make peace with David and became his loyal crew. The Syrians also ditched the Ammonites and refused to help them again. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 191. Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. 2. And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. 3. But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land? {Thinkest...: Heb. In thine eyes doth David, etc} 4. Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away. 5. Then there went {certain}, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and {then} return. 6. And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah. {odious: Heb. to stink} 7. So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. 8. And when David heard {of it}, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men. 9. And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come {were} by themselves in the field. 10. Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put {them} in array against the Syrians. {the battle...: Heb. the face of the battle was} {choice: or, young men} 11. And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set {themselves} in array against the children of Ammon. {Abishai: Heb. Abshai} 12. And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee. 13. Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do {that which is} good in his sight. 14. So Joab and the people that {were} with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him. 15. And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem. 16. And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that {were} beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer {went} before them. {river: that is, Euphrates} {Shophach: also called, Shobach} 17. And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set {the battle} in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him. 18. But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand {men which fought in} chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host. 19. And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 201. So, like, when the year was over and stuff, you know, during the time when kings usually go out for battle, Joab took his army and totally wrecked the land of the Ammonites. Then he went and surrounded Rabbah. But David stayed back in Jerusalem, chilling. Anyway, Joab attacked Rabbah and totally demolished it. Yeah, just after the year ended and stuff, you know. 2. So David snatched the king's crown right off his head and guess what? It was heavy af, like a whole talent of gold! And not only that, it was blinged out with mad precious stones. He straight up put that crown on his own head, like a boss. And to top it off, he scored a huge haul of loot from the city. 3. So he brought out all the people from there and totally wrecked them with saws, iron harrows, and axes. David totally demolished all the cities of the Ammonite crew. Then David and the whole gang went back to Jerusalem. 4. So there was this war that happened in Gezer with the Philistines. Sibbechai the Hushathite totally defeated Sippai, who was one of those giant dudes, and they totally dominated. It was intense, man. 5. So there was another battle with the Philistines and Elhanan, Jair's son, took down Lahmi, Goliath the Gittite's brother. Lahmi's spear was massive, like a super thick weaving rod. (Jair was also known as Jaareoregim.) 6. Once again, there was a huge battle going down in Gath. Over there, they had this one dude who was mega tall and had a total of twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and foot! Crazy, right? And get this, he was actually the son of a giant. No joke! 7. But yo, when he dissed Israel, Jonathan, Shimea, David's bro, straight up took him out. (Defied can mean like, he insulted or disrespected) (Oh, and just so you know, Shimea is also called Shammah, you feel me?) 8. These kids were born to the massive dude from Gath; and David and his crew totally took them down. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 201. And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out {to battle}, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it. {after...: Heb. at the return of the year} 2. And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and {there were} precious stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city. {to weigh: Heb. the weight of} 3. And he brought out the people that {were} in it, and cut {them} with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem. 4. And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, {that was} of the children of the giant: and they were subdued. {arose: or, continued: Heb. stood} {Gezer: also called, Gob} {Sippai: also called, Saph} {the giant: or, Rapha} 5. And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff {was} like a weaver's beam. {Jair: also called, Jaareoregim} 6. And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of {great} stature, whose fingers and toes {were} four and twenty, six {on each hand}, and six {on each foot}: and he also was the son of the giant. {great...: Heb. measure} {the son...: Heb. born to the giant, or, Rapha} 7. But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's brother slew him. {defied: or, reproached} {Shimea: also called Shammah} 8. These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 211. Then this dude named Satan straight up came at Israel, and like, totally convinced David to count all the peeps in Israel. 2. So David was like, yo Joab and peeps in charge, go and count all the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan and let me know how many there are, you feel me? 3. And Joab was like, yo, may the LORD bless his people like a hundred times more than they already are, but, yo, my king, aren't they all your servants? So, like, why you gotta ask for this, my king? Why you gonna do something that's gonna mess things up for Israel? 4. But the king's decision overpowered Joab. So Joab bounced and traveled all over Israel, finally ending up in Jerusalem. 5. So Joab told David the total number of people. The whole gang in Israel was, like, a million plus a hundred thousand dudes wielding swords, and Judah had 470,000 sword-wielding dudes. 6. But Joab didn't include Levi and Benjamin in the count because he thought the king's decision was totally messed up. 7. God was not happy with this and decided to punish Israel. (And it really upset the LORD that this happened) 8. So David was like, 'Yo God, I messed up big time with this, and I totally admit it. But please, I'm begging you, forgive me for being so dumb.' 9. And the LORD was like, yo Gad, David's seer, listen up, 10. Yo, go tell David this, the message straight from the LORD: I got three options for you, pick one and I'll make it happen for you. Trust. 11. So Gad came to David and was like, 'Yo, the LORD says, 'Listen up, bro. Take your pick' 12. Yo, you got three choices here: either endure three years straight of famine, or get wrecked by your enemies in just three months, with their swords ready to strike you, orrr... how 'bout three days of the Lord's sword, like a major pandemic sweeping the whole land, with the angel of the Lord spreading destruction all over Israel? So, better think it through and decide what message I should take back to the one who sent me. 13. So David told Gad, 'I'm in a really tough spot right now. I'd rather face the Almighty, because His mercy is beyond huge. But please, spare me from dealing with human troubles.' 14. Yo, the LORD straight up sent some serious plague to Israel, and it was bad news: like, a whopping seventy thousand men ended up biting the dust. 15. So, like, God was totally fed up with Jerusalem, right? So he sent this badass angel to wreck everything. But while the destruction was going down, God was like, 'Hold up, let me rethink this evil plan.' He spoke to the angel, who was in the middle of tearing things apart, and said, 'Okay, that's enough. Stop right now.' And guess where this angel ended up chilling? Right by Ornan the Jebusite's threshing floor, dude. By the way, Ornan's another name for Araunah. Cool, right? 😎 16. So David looked up and saw this angel dude from the LORD just chilling between heaven and earth, holding a sword and ready to wreck Jerusalem. David and the OGs of Israel, dressed in some humble sackcloth, straight up dropped to the ground on their faces. 17. Yo, God, listen up. It was me who told the people to take the census, my bad. Yeah, I messed up big time and did some really bad stuff. But these innocent peeps didn't do anything wrong. So here's the deal, God. Put the blame on me and my fam, but spare your people from suffering any consequences. 18. So, basically, this angel dude told Gad to go tell David that he needs to go up and build, like, a holy spot for the LORD on this threshingfloor owned by Ornan the Jebusite. 19. So David was like, 'Okay, Gad, I hear you loud and clear. You're speaking on behalf of the Lord? I'm in! Let's go up!' 20. So Ornan was doing his thing, you know, threshing wheat, when all of a sudden, he catches a glimpse of an angel. And guess what? Him and his four sons totally freaked out and went into hiding. 21. So David approached Ornan, and when Ornan saw David, he immediately stepped away from the threshing floor and humbly bowed down with his face on the ground. 22. So David was like, 'Hey Ornan, can you hook me up with this threshing floor? I wanna build an altar for the LORD there. But don't just hand it over for free, I'm willing to pay the full price. It's important because it could stop the plague from spreading among the people.' 23. And Ornan was like, 'Yo David, take this stuff and do whatever you think is cool, bro. Check it out, I'm giving you these awesome oxen for the burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for making firewood, and the wheat for the meat offering. It's all yours, man.' 24. King David was like, no way dude, I'm totally gonna buy it from you at the regular price. I can't just take something that belongs to you and offer sacrifices to the Lord without paying for it, you know? 25. So David paid Ornan six hundred shekels of gold in full for the land. 26. So David was like 'Yo, I'm gonna build an altar for the LORD right here.' He made some sick burnt offerings and peace offerings, then called out to the LORD. And guess what? The LORD totally answered him, with some fire from heaven right on that altar for the burnt offering. How awesome is that? 27. So God was like, 'Yo, angel, chill and put away your sword.' 28. So, David was like, totally stoked when he saw that the Lord answered his prayers on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite. He decided to make a sacrifice right then and there! 29. Back in the day, Moses built this sick tabernacle for the LORD in the middle of nowhere, along with a rad altar for burnt offerings. They were set up in this super legit spot called Gibeon. 30. But David couldn't slide into God's DMs to get advice because he was shook, fearing the angel of the LORD carryin' a sword. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 211. And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. 2. And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know {it}. 3. And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they {be}: but, my lord the king, {are} they not all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel? 4. Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem. 5. And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all {they of} Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah {was} four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword. 6. But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab. 7. And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel. {And...: Heb. And it was evil in the eyes of the LORD concerning this thing} 8. And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly. 9. And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying, 10. Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three {things}: choose thee one of them, that I may do {it} unto thee. {offer: Heb. stretch out} 11. So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose thee {Choose...: Heb. Take to thee} 12. Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh {thee}; or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me. 13. And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the LORD; for very great {are} his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man. {very great: or, very many} 14. So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men. 15. And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. {Ornan: also called, Araunah} 16. And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders {of Israel, who were} clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 17. And David said unto God, {Is it} not I {that} commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but {as for} these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued. 18. Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. 19. And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the LORD. 20. And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. {And Ornan...: or, When Ornan turned back and saw the angel, then he and his four sons with him hid themselves} 21. And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with {his} face to the ground. 22. Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of {this} threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people. {Grant: Heb. Give} 23. And Ornan said unto David, Take {it} to thee, and let my lord the king do {that which is} good in his eyes: lo, I give {thee} the oxen {also} for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all. 24. And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take {that} which {is} thine for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost. 25. So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight. 26. And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering. 27. And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof. 28. At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. 29. For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, {were} at that season in the high place at Gibeon. 30. But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 221. So David was like, 'Yo, peeps, check it out! This right here is the crib of the LORD God, and this sick setup is where we do the burnt offerings for Israel.' 2. So David told everyone to bring together all the people from other places who were living in Israel, and he hired skilled workers to cut and shape stones for building God's house. 3. So David gathered a ton of iron for the nails that would be used to secure the doors and hinges of the gates, as well as a crazy amount of brass that was practically weightless. 4. And there were tons of cedar trees: the peeps from Zidon and Tyre hooked David up with a bunch of cedar wood. 5. David was like, dude, my son Solomon is just a young bean, and the fancy house we're gonna build for the LORD needs to be super lit, like famous and legendary in every country. So I'm gonna start getting things ready ASAP. David went all out and prepped like crazy before he passed away. 6. So he like, called Solomon his son, and was all like, yo dude, I need you to build a sick house for the LORD God of Israel. 7. Yo, Solomon, listen up! I was thinking, bro, I want to build a sick crib for the LORD, my God. 8. So, like, God came to me and was like, 'Yo, you've spilled so much blood and caused so many wars. Sorry, but you can't build a house for me 'cause you've been too violent in my eyes.' 9. Yo, check it out! You're gonna have a son who's all about that chill vibe. He's gonna be a total pro at handling any haters that come his way. His name's gonna be Solomon, which means peace, and during his time, Israel is gonna be all about that peaceful and calm life. No drama, just good vibes, ya feel me? Peace out! 10. He's gonna make a sick pad in my name, and he's gonna be like my ride-or-die son, and I'll totally be his pops. And his kingdom over Israel is gonna rule forever, like for real. 11. Yo, dude, may the LORD be with you and help you succeed in building the house of the LORD your God, just like he promised you. 12. May the LORD hook you up with mad wisdom and understanding, and put you in charge of Israel, so you can stay true to the laws of the LORD your God. 13. If you really want to succeed, make sure you follow all the rules and laws that the LORD told Moses to tell the people of Israel. Stay strong, be brave, and don't be afraid or discouraged. 14. Yo, check it out, when I was going through a tough time, I hustled and got together a whopping hundred thousand talents of gold, plus a million talents of silver. And let me tell you, I've got so much brass and iron that it's off the charts and can't even be weighed. Oh, and I've also got a surplus of timber and stone ready to go. You can totally add to it if needed. 15. Plus, you've got a ton of skilled workers with you. There's builders, stone and woodworkers, and all sorts of talented individuals for every kind of task. They're basically experts in their field! 16. Like, there's, like, sooo much gold, silver, brass, and iron that it's, like, totally uncountable. So, like, get up and start taking action, and may the LORD be with you and all, you know? 17. David told all the big shots in Israel to lend a hand to his boy Solomon, and this is what he said, 18. Isn't the LORD your God chillin' with you? And hasn't he hooked you up with mad peace all around? Like, he totally made the people living in the land hand it over to me, and now the whole place is under the LORD's control and his squad's too. 19. Yo, focus all your energy and vibes on finding the LORD your God. So get up and start constructing a super cool sanctuary for the LORD God. Bring the rad ark of the covenant of the LORD and all the holy stuff into the sick house that's gonna be built in the name of the LORD. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 221. Then David said, This {is} the house of the LORD God, and this {is} the altar of the burnt offering for Israel. 2. And David commanded to gather together the strangers that {were} in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God. 3. And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; 4. Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David. 5. And David said, Solomon my son {is} young and tender, and the house {that is} to be builded for the LORD {must be} exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will {therefore} now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death. 6. Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the LORD God of Israel. 7. And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God: 8. But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. 9. Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. {Solomon: that is, Peaceable} 10. He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I {will be} his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever. 11. Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee. 12. Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God. 13. Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed. 14. Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto. {trouble: or, poverty} 15. Moreover {there are} workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work. {workers...: that is, masons and carpenters} 16. Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, {there is} no number. Arise {therefore}, and be doing, and the LORD be with thee. 17. David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, {saying}, 18. {Is} not the LORD your God with you? and hath he {not} given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people. 19. Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 231. So like, when David became, like, really old and had lived a super long life, he decided to make Solomon, his son, the king of Israel. 2. And he brought all the cool squad of Israel, including the holy ones and the faithful crew. 3. So, like, the Levites, they were like counted when they turned thirty years old and older. And when they counted them, like, each person individually, there were like a total of 38,000 of them. Cool, right? 4. Out of all of them, there were a total of 24K guys who were all about getting things done for the house of the LORD. Then, there were another 6K peeps who took on the role of officers and judges, they were all about overseeing things. 5. There were also like, freaking 4k porters and 4k dope people vibin' and praising the LORD with the mad instruments that I, David, made for praising. 6. So David split them up into different groups for the sons of Levi, like Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 7. The Gershonites had Laadan and Shimei, or you can call him Libni too. 8. The squad of Laadan; the leader was Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three of 'em. 9. The dudes from Shimei were Shelomith, Haziel, and Haran, three of them. These dudes were the leaders of the dads in the Laadan fam. 10. Shimei had four sons: Jahath, Zina (also known as Zizah), Jeush, and Beriah. 11. Jahath was the head honcho, and Zizah was second in command, but Jeush and Beriah didn't have a ton of kids. So they were accounted for together, based on their dad's family. 12. Here are the sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four in total. 13. Amram had two sons, Aaron and Moses. Aaron was chosen to make the holiest things sacred. He and his sons were meant to forever burn incense and serve the LORD. They were tasked with blessing in his name forever. 14. So, like, talking about Moses, the dude chosen by God, his kids were part of the Levi tribe. 15. Moses had two sons named Gershom and Eliezer. 16. Among Gershom's crew, Shebuel was the head honcho. (Shebuel also goes by Shubael, just so you know.) 17. And Eliezer only had one son, Rehabiah, who was the leader. Rehabiah, on the other hand, had a whole bunch of sons, like, seriously multiplied in number. 18. Among Izhar's kids, the top dog is Shelomith, also known as Shelomoth. 19. Among Hebron's children were Jeriah, the OG, Amariah, the runner-up, Jahaziel, the bronze medalist, and Jekameam, bringing up the rear. 20. Uzziel had two sons: Michah was the older one, and then came Jesiah. 21. Yo, Merari had some sons named Mahli and Mushi. Mahli's sons were Eleazar and Kish. 22. Eleazar passed away without any sons, but he had daughters. His relatives, the sons of Kish, took care of them. 23. The homies of Mushi; Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, straight up three of them. 24. These were the sons of Levi, following their family lines. They were the head honchos, named and counted, responsible for getting stuff done at the house of the LORD. They started their service at the ripe age of twenty and older. 25. David was like, yo, the LORD God of Israel hooked up His peeps with some major chill vibes, letting them kick it in Jerusalem for eternity and stuff. And by the way, He's straight up posted in Jerusalem, you know what I'm saying? 26. And to the Levites too, they won't have to lug around the tabernacle or any of its stuff for doing their duties. 27. So, like, David, before he kicked the bucket, he made sure to count all the Levites who were twenty years old and older. Like, he really made sure to number them and stuff. 28. Because they were responsible for assisting the sons of Aaron in their duties in the house of the LORD, whether in the courts, chambers, purification of holy things, or any work related to the service of the house of God; their position was at the side of the sons of Aaron. 29. This includes the bread for display, the high-quality flour for offering, the yummy flatbread, the pan-cooked dishes, the fried goodies, and all the different sizes and measurements needed for everything. 30. And like, every morning we gotta be there, y'know, ready to show some gratitude to the LORD, and also in the evening too, no exceptions. 31. And like, they gotta make sure to offer all those burnt sacrifices to the LORD on the sabbaths, at the start of the months, and during the scheduled celebrations in the right amount, following the proper procedure that was given to them, you know, always in front of the LORD. 32. And they gotta, like, make sure they're on top of things when it comes to taking care of the tabernacle where everyone meets up, and also the sacred {place}, and they should totally support their bros, the sons of Aaron, in serving at the house of the LORD. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 231. So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel. 2. And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites. 3. Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. 4. Of which, twenty and four thousand {were} to set forward the work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand {were} officers and judges: {set...: or, oversee} 5. Moreover four thousand {were} porters; and four thousand praised the LORD with the instruments which I made, {said David}, to praise {therewith}. 6. And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, {namely}, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. {courses: Heb. divisions} 7. Of the Gershonites {were}, Laadan, and Shimei. {Laadan: or, Libni} 8. The sons of Laadan; the chief {was} Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three. 9. The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These {were} the chief of the fathers of Laadan. 10. And the sons of Shimei {were}, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four {were} the sons of Shimei. {Zina: or, Zizah} 11. And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to {their} father's house. {had...: Heb. did not multiply sons} 12. The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 13. The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever. 14. Now {concerning} Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi. 15. The sons of Moses {were}, Gershom, and Eliezer. 16. Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel {was} the chief. {Shebuel: also called, Shubael} 17. And the sons of Eliezer {were}, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. {the chief: or, the first} {very many: Heb. highly multiplied} 18. Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief. {Shelomith: also called, Shelomoth} 19. Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 20. Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah the first, and Jesiah the second. 21. The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and Kish. 22. And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them. {brethren: or, kinsmen} 23. The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three. 24. These {were} the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers; {even} the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward. 25. For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever: {that...: or, and he dwelleth in Jerusalem, etc} 26. And also unto the Levites; they shall no {more} carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof. 27. For by the last words of David the Levites {were} numbered from twenty years old and above: {numbered: Heb. number} 28. Because their office {was} to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God; {their...: Heb. their station was at the hand of the sons of Aaron} 29. Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for {that which is baked in} the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; {pan: or, flat plate} 30. And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even; 31. And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded unto them, continually before the LORD: 32. And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the holy {place}, and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 241. So here's the breakdown of Aaron's fam: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, all his sons. 2. However, Nadab and Abihu passed away before their dad, and didn't have any kids, so Eleazar and Ithamar took on the responsibility of serving as priests instead. 3. So David split them up, with Zadok, one of Eleazar's crew, and Ahimelech, one of Ithamar's squad, assigning them to their respective jobs. 4. So, like, there were more top dudes from the sons of Eleazar than from the sons of Ithamar, and that's how they split up. Among the sons of Eleazar, there were sixteen top dudes from the house of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar also based on their fathers' households. 5. So they drew lots to separate them. The ones responsible for running the holy place and the house of God were chosen from the sons of Eleazar and the sons of Ithamar. 6. So Shemaiah, who was the son of Nethaneel and a scribe, wrote all of this down in front of the king, the princes, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the important leaders from the priests and Levites. They divided the households, choosing one for Eleazar and one for Ithamar, based on their family lineages. 7. So, like, the first squad went to Jehoiarib, and the second squad went to Jedaiah, 8. And then there's Harim, you know? He's got that third spot on lockdown. Oh, and let's not forget about Seorim, holding it down with that fourth place swag. 9. And then there's Malchijah, taking fifth place, and Mijamin coming in at six. 10. Then came the seventh one for Hakkoz, and the eighth one for Abijah, 11. Jeshua gets number nine, Shecaniah is in the tenth spot, 12. Then came Eliashib at number 11 and Jakim at number 12, 13. Huppah gets lucky number thirteen, and Jeshebeab takes the stage at number fourteen. 14. Bilgah got the fifteenth place, while Immer settled for the sixteenth spot. 15. Hezir got the seventeenth spot, and Aphses got the eighteenth spot. 16. And then Pethahiah got the nineteenth spot, while Jehezekel snagged the twentieth like a pro! 17. Jachin is number 21, Gamul is number 22. Just sayin'. 18. The twenty-third for Delaiah, the twenty-fourth for Maaziah. 19. These were the schedules for their duties when they went to work at the LORD's crib, just doing their usual thing like Aaron, their OG dad, was instructed by the LORD God of Israel. 20. And there were some other cool dudes from the Levi crew: Amram had a son named Shubael, and Shubael had a son named Jehdeiah. By the way, Shubael was also known as Shebuel. 21. Speaking of Rehabiah: among the kids of Rehabiah, the OG was Isshiah. 22. From the Izharites, there was this dude named Shelomoth. He had a son named Jahath, who was also known as Shelomith. 23. And Hebron had these sons: Jeriah, the eldest; Amariah, the second; Jahaziel, the third; Jekameam, the fourth. 24. Among Uzziel's crew, we got Michah. And from Michah's squad, we got Shamir. 25. Michah's bro was Isshiah and Zechariah was one of Isshiah's sons. 26. The homies of Merari were Mahli and Mushi, and check it out, Jaaziah's sons were Beno. 27. Merari's sons were Jaaziah, and he had Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. 28. Mahli had Eleazar but he didn't have any kids. 29. About Kish: Kish had a son named Jerahmeel. 30. The dudes from Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites, following their fam's legacy. 31. These bros also rolled some dice right in front of their fellow bros, the sons of Aaron, while David the king, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the top dads of the priests and Levites were chilling. They were the important dads lookin' out for their younger bros. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 241. Now {these are} the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 2. But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's office. 3. And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service. 4. And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and {thus} were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar {there were} sixteen chief men of the house of {their} fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of their fathers. 5. Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors {of the house} of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 6. And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, {one} of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and {before} the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and {one} taken for Ithamar. {principal...: Heb. house of the father} 7. Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 8. The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 9. The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 10. The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 11. The ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, 12. The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 13.

The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel, 17. The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul, 18. The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah. 19. These {were} the orderings of them in their service to come into the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him. 20. And the rest of the sons of Levi {were these}: Of the sons of Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah. {Shubael: also called, Shebuel} 21. Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first {was} Isshiah. 22. Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath. {Shelomoth: also called, Shelomith} 23. And the sons {of Hebron}; Jeriah {the first}, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. 24. {Of} the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir. 25. The brother of Michah {was} Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah; Zechariah. 26. The sons of Merari {were} Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno. 27. The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. 28. Of Mahli {came} Eleazar, who had no sons. 29. Concerning Kish: the son of Kish {was} Jerahmeel. 30. The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These {were} the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers. 31. These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brethren. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 251. So David and the leaders of the army assigned some people to serve the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun. These people were skilled in prophesying with harps, psalteries, and cymbals. The number of workers assigned to each service was: 2. The sons of Asaph were Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah. They served alongside Asaph and prophesied under the authority of the king. (Asarelah was also known as Jesharelah.) 3. Jeduthun had some cool kids. There were Gedaliah, Zeri (also known as Izri), Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, making it a squad of six. They all jammed with their dad Jeduthun, who was known to play the harp like a pro. They weren't just playing for fun though, they had a higher purpose! They used their musical skills to give thanks and praise to the LORD, spreading good vibes all around. 4. For Heman: Heman's crew included Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth. Uzziel was also known as Azareel, and Shebuel was also called Shubael. 5. Yo, these were all Heman, the king's seer, who had mad connection with God to hype up the party. And God blessed Heman with a crew of fourteen sons and three daughters. Word up! 6. All these peeps were responsible for jammin' in their dad's band at the crib of the LORD. They had cymbals, guitars, and harps, and their gig was to rock out at the house of God, doin' what the king told 'em to do. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were the ones in charge, just like the king wanted. 7. So, like, there were, you know, a total of 288 super talented brothers and sisters who were totally skilled in singing the songs of the LORD. 8. And they cast lots to determine, regardless of status or position, whether they were a popular influencer or just a regular person. 9. So, Asaph was chosen first, and his assignment went to Joseph. The second lot went to Gedaliah and his crew, making a total of twelve guys! 10. And then there was Zaccur, with his squad of twelve, including his sons and bros. 11.

      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 251.

      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 261. Now, let's talk about the crew of cool gatekeepers: One of them was Meshelemiah, who was the son of Kore and a part of the Asaph squad. (Fun fact: Meshelemiah was also known as Shelemiah, and Asaph was sometimes referred to as Ebiasaph.) 2. The dudes from Meshelemiah were Zechariah (the oldest bro), Jediael (the second in line), Zebadiah (number three), and Jathniel (the fourth dude). 3. The squad rolls like this: Elam holding it down at number five, Jehohanan claiming number six, and Elioenai repping number seven. 4. In addition, Obededom had these children: Shemaiah, who was the oldest; Jehozabad, who came next; Joah, the one after that; Sacar, the fourth one; and Nethaneel, who was the youngest. 5. Ammiel got the sixth spot, Issachar grabbed the lucky number seven, and Peulthai secured the eighth position. God totally blessed Obededom, by the way! 6. Shemaiah had some kids of his own who became boss rulers in their dad's house. And let me tell you, they were total beasts, like, super strong and courageous. 7. Shemaiah's sons were Othni, Rephael, Obed, and Elzabad. They had some pretty buff brothers too, like Elihu and Semachiah. 8. So, Obededom had sixty-two sons, along with their cousins and other skilled and strong guys, who were all ready to serve. 9. And Meshelemiah had some epic squad, bros who were absolute units, like, frickin' strong as heck, there were a total 18 of 'em. 10. Then Hosah, from the fam Merari, had kids too. There was Simri, the leader, and even though he wasn't the oldest, his dad still made him the top dog. 11. Hosah had thirteen homies: Hilkiah, Tebaliah, Zechariah, and some more bros. 12. So there were these groups of porters, you know, like the top guys, who were in charge of different areas, kinda like watching out for each other, doing their thing, serving in the house of the LORD. 13. And they used TikTok challenges to decide which gate each person from different family backgrounds would be responsible for. It didn't matter if they were young or old, everyone had a fair chance in this process. #familygatecasting #equality 14. So, Shelemiah got assigned the eastern area, and they actually threw some dice to decide where Zechariah, his son who's, like, really smart and wise, would go. Turns out, Zechariah got the northern spot. (BTW, Shelemiah was also known as Meshelemiah) 15. And to Obededom and his sons, they were given the house of Asuppim in the southern region. (Asuppim means gatherings in Hebrew) 16. Shuppim and Hosah got the spot towards the west, by the Shallecheth gate, near the walkway that goes up, taking care of their assigned area. 17. There were six Levites facing east, four each day facing north and four each day facing south. Two Levites were assigned to the Asuppim gate and two to the other. 18. On the west side of Parbar, there were four guards at the entrance, and two at Parbar itself. 19. These are the groups of gatekeepers among the descendants of Kore and the descendants of Merari. 20. And among the Levites, Ahijah was in charge of all the cool stuff in God's crib, like the sick treasures and the dedicated things that were totally holy. 21. Now let's talk about the dudes from Laadan - you know, that Gershonite guy. Laadan was the head honcho, the OG, the chief father of all the Gershonites. And check it, Jehieli, who was also known as Jehiel, was one of Laadan's main crew. (By the way, Libni is just another name for Laadan, in case you weren't hip to that.) 22. The squad of Jehieli had two bros, Zetham and Joel, who were in charge of keeping all the mad stacks in the house of the LORD. 23. From the fam of Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel: 24. Yo, Shebuel, the son of Gershom, who's the son of Moses, was the boss of all the treasures. 25. And Eliezer had some cool siblings; his son Rehabiah, and his son Jeshaiah, and his son Joram, and his son Zichri, and his son Shelomith. 26. Shelomith and his crew were in charge of all the epic treasures that belonged to the holy stuff. These treasures were dedicated by King David, the top leaders, the badass commanders of thousands and hundreds, and the mighty warriors of the army. 27. They used the treasures they gained from victorious battles to sustain the house of the LORD. #battlebooty 28. And all the stuff that Samuel the seer, Saul Kish's kid, Abner Ner's kid, and Joab Zeruiah's kid had offered up; and anyone who had offered anything, it was approved by Shelomith and his crew. 29. Among the Izharites, Chenaniah and his homies were in charge of handling stuff on the outside for the peeps of Israel, like being officers and judges. 30. Among the Hebronites, there were Hashabiah and his squad, a bunch of badass warriors, totaling to one thousand and seven hundred strong. They were the top dogs, leading the charge for Israel on this side of the Jordan River, handling all the important tasks for the LORD and the king. They were the bosses of the operation, making sure things ran smoothly! 31. There was this dude named Jerijah, who was like the boss among the Hebronites, you know, following in the footsteps of his ancestors and all. So, around David's 40th year in charge, they went on a search, and lo and behold, they discovered some seriously badass warriors in Jazer of Gilead. 32. And his bros, super cool dudes, there were like 2700 top dads that King David made rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.

      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 271. So, like, the Israelites, ya know, they were organized and all, with the main dudes and leaders in charge of thousands and hundreds, along with officers who helped the king with all sorts of stuff. They had this whole system where different groups took turns serving each month, and in each group there were twenty-four thousand people. Pretty rad, right? 2. For the first month, Jashobeam, the son of Zabdiel, was in charge and led his crew of 24,000 warriors. 3. The leader of all the squad captains in the first month was from the descendants of Perez. 4. In the second month, there was this dude called Dodai, an Ahohite. And guess what? Mikloth was also a ruler in his crew. And get this, there were like 24,000 peeps in their squad. (Oh, by the way, Dodai is also known as Dodo.) 5. In the third month, the leader of the third group was Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, a top-tier priest. His crew consisted of a solid 24,000 dudes. (By the way, he was a major boss.) 6. This dude Benaiah was a total beast, like, the strongest out of the thirty warriors and even more impressive than the rest. And guess what? His son Ammizabad was right there with him, like father, like son. They were a power duo, no doubt. 7.

Also, when it comes to the different tribes of Israel, just to give you a heads up, the leader of the Reubenites was Eliezer, who happened to be the son of Zichri. And as for the Simeonites, their ruler was Shephatiah, the son of Maachah. 17. Among the Levites, there's this cool dude called Hashabiah, who happens to be Kemuel's son. And on the Aaronites side, we have this other dude named Zadok, who's pretty awesome too! 18. Representing Judah, we got Elihu, a sibling of David. And for Issachar, we got Omri, Michael's kid. By the way, Elihu is also known as Eliab. 19. Representing Zebulun, we got Ishmaiah (Obadiah's kid), and holding it down for Naphtali, we got Jerimoth (Azriel's offspring). 20. Representing the squad from Ephraim, we got Hoshea, the offspring of Azaziah. And repping the half tribe of Manasseh, we got Joel, the son of Pedaiah. 21.

So like, Dan had this dude named Azareel, who was like the son of Jeroham. And he was one of the big shots, you know, one of the cool guys leading the tribes of Israel. 23. But David didn't bother counting the ones who were twenty years old and younger, cuz God promised to make Israel as numerous as the stars in the sky. 24. So Joab, Zeruiah's son, started counting, but he never finished 'cause it made God really angry at Israel. And the number never made it into King David's records, btw. 25. Azmaveth, Adiel's son, was in charge of the king's treasures. Jehonathan, Uzziah's son, was responsible for the storehouses in the fields, cities, villages, and castles. 26. And the one in charge of those who worked in the field and tilled the ground was Ezri, son of Chelub: 27.

BTW, Jonathan's uncle was totally legit as a wise adviser and writer, and Jehiel, Hachmoni's offspring, was like the personal secretary to the king and his crew. 33. Ahithophel was like the king's trusted advisor, and Hushai from Archite squad was the king's bestie: 34. And following Ahithophel, there were Jehoiada (Benaiah's son) and Abiathar. The king's badass general was Joab. \n",

These {were} the princes of the tribes of Israel. 23. But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens. 24. Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David. {was: Heb. ascended} 25.

      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 281. So David gathered all the cool leaders of Israel - the leaders of the tribes, the bosses of the crews that serve the king on a schedule, the bosses of the big teams and smaller teams, and the managers who handle all of the king and his sons' stuff and property. He also called the important people, the warriors, and all the brave dudes to come to Jerusalem. (By the way, when it says 'possessions' it means like, their cool stuff. And 'officers' might mean like, those eunuch dudes.) 2. So, like, David the king stood up and was all like, 'Listen up, fam! I got this idea in my heart to build a chill house for the ark of the covenant of the LORD and for our God's footstool. And guess what? I was totally prepared to make it happen! 3. But God told me, 'Nah, you can't build a crib for my name, cuz you've been all about that battlefield life, spilling blood left and right.' 4. But yo, the LORD God of Israel chose me, like, before my dad's whole squad, to be the eternal king of Israel, 'cause he chose Judah to be the ruler. And out of all the homies in my dad's crew, he chose me to be the king of all Israel, straight up. 5. Out of all my kids (and trust, I got a lot), the LORD picked my son Solomon to take the throne and rule over Israel in His kingdom. 6. And he was like, yo, Solomon, your bro, he's gonna be the one to flex and build my crib and my dope hangout spots. 'Cause I totally picked him to be my homie, like my son, and I'm gonna be his awesome dad. 7. Yo, his kingdom gonna be on fleek forever, as long as he stays steady following my commandments and judgments, like how it is right now. {strong: Hebrew} 8. So, like, everyone in Israel, listen up! Let's all gather together, with our awesome God watching, and make sure we follow every single command He's given us. By doing that, we'll totally get to enjoy this amazing land and pass it down to our kids as a super rad inheritance that will last forever. 9. Yo, Solomon my dude, listen up! Get to know the God your pops worshipped and be all about serving him with a legit heart and a totally willing mindset. 'Cause lemme tell you, the Big Guy upstairs sees straight through us all, knows what's going on inside our heads. So if you actually try to connect with him, you'll find him right there with you. But bro, if you turn your back on him, he's gonna ditch you for good, no second chances. 10. Listen up, fam; God picked you to build His crib, the sanctuary. Stay lit and get it done. 11. So David hooked up Solomon, his son, with all the deets on how to build the porch, houses, treasuries, upper chambers, inner parlors, and the spot for the mercy seat. 12. And the blueprint of everything he had envisioned by the spirit, including the layout of the LORD's house and all the surrounding rooms, as well as the storage spaces for the treasures of God's house and the sacred items. (This includes everything he had envisioned with him.) 13. And yeah, don't forget about the stuff the priests and Levites do, you know, all the work and services they have to handle at the house of the LORD, including taking care of all the sacred items there. 14. He traded gold for gold, weighing it carefully to obtain all types of instruments needed for various purposes. He also exchanged silver for silver, ensuring the right weight for all kinds of instruments required for different tasks. 15. Even the measurements for the gold candlesticks and their gold lamps, with precise measurements for each candlestick and its lamps. And also the measurements for the silver candlesticks, both for the candlestick itself and its lamps, according to the specific purpose of each candlestick. 16. And he exchanged gold for the bread tables, giving it according to its weight, similar to how he gave silver for the silver tables: 17. And there were pure gold fleshhooks, bowls, and cups, as well as golden basins provided in the exact weight for each basin. Additionally, there were silver basins of the same weight made of silver. 18. The altar of incense was made with pure gold, carefully measured. Gold was also used to make the chariot design of the cherubims, which had their wings spread out and covered the ark of the LORD's covenant. 19. Yo, God spelled it all out for me, King David, through some sick writing skills. He straight up gave me all the deets about this pattern, with His hand guiding me. No cap, I understood it all. 20. And David was like, yo Solomon, my dude, be strong and confident, and like, totally don't freak out or be scared. 'Cause the LORD God, yeah, my God, is gonna hang with you. He won't bail on you or ditch you until you finish all the work for the house of the LORD. 21. And yo, check it out, the priests and the Levites gonna be rollin' with you, holding it down for all the work in the house of God. You gonna have all kinds of talented folks, ready and eager to do any task. Even the leaders and the whole crew gonna be completely under your control. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 281. And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem. {possession: or, cattle} {and of...: or, and his sons} {officers: or, eunuchs} 2. Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: {As for me}, I {had} in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: 3. But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because thou {hast been} a man of war, and hast shed blood. {blood: Heb. bloods} 4. Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah {to be} the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked me to make {me} king over all Israel: 5. And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over Israel. 6. And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my courts: for I have chosen him {to be} my son, and I will be his father. 7. Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day. {constant: Heb. strong} 8. Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave {it} for an inheritance for your children after you for ever. 9. And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever. 10. Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do {it}. 11. Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat, 12. And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things: {of all that...: Heb. of all that was with him} 13. Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD. 14. {He gave} of gold by weight for {things} of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; {silver also} for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service: 15. Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, {both} for the candlestick, and {also} for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every candlestick. 16. And by weight {he gave} gold for the tables of shewbread, for every table; and {likewise} silver for the tables of silver: 17. Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for the golden basons {he gave gold} by weight for every bason; and {likewise silver} by weight for every bason of silver: 18. And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out {their wings}, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 19. All {this, said David}, the LORD made me understand in writing by {his} hand upon me, {even} all the works of this pattern. 20. And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do {it}: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, {even} my God, {will be} with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD. 21. And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, {even they shall be with thee} for all the service of the house of God: and {there shall be} with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people {will be} wholly at thy commandment. \n",
      "Gen Z: 1 Chronicles 291. Yo, peeps! King David dropped some truth on the whole crew. He was like, 'Check it, y'all! My son Solomon, he's the one God's handpicked. But let's be real, he's still young and inexperienced, and this job is no joke. This ain't just some regular crib, it's a place for the Almighty God himself, ya heard? 2. So, like, I totally went all out in preparing everything for the house of my God. I got like, the sickest gold for gold things, and some super sleek silver for silver stuff, and the raddest brass for brass things. Oh, and I didn't forget about iron, got that for iron things too. And of course, I hooked it up with some legit wood for the wooden stuff. Talk about bling, I've got onyx stones, all kinds of stunning gemstones, and even marble stones in like, crazy amounts. It's all gonna be lit! 3. Dude, listen up! I'm totally all about my love for my God's crib. I personally got some sick stash, like gold and silver, that I threw down to deck out my God's place. It's, like, extra on top of everything else I already had lined up for the holy house, you know? 4. Like, they needed, like, a whopping three thousand talents of gold from Ophir, and like, an insane seven thousand talents of legit refined silver to deck out the walls of the houses, you know? 5. The cash for gold stuff goes to gold stuff, and the cash for silver things goes to silver things, and for all kinds of dope stuff made by super skilled artists. So, who's down to dedicate their hustle to the LORD today? Like, put your skills to work for Him, ya know? 6. So, like, the main dudes, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, and the big shots in charge of thousands and hundreds, along with the bosses overseeing the king's projects, were all like super willing to offer their help. 7. And they contributed to the work of the house of God a total of 5,000 talents of gold, 10,000 drams of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of brass, and a whopping 100,000 talents of iron. 8. And those who had found valuable stones gave them to the treasury of the Lord's house, through Jehiel the Gershonite. 9. And the people were hyped because they gave willingly, showing their full-hearted dedication to the LORD. And even King David was stoked, totally celebrating with massive joy. 10. So David, like, totally blessed the LORD in front of everyone: and he was all like, 'Yo, you're totally blessed, LORD God of Israel our father, like, forever and ever.' 11. Lord, you are so amazing and powerful, and you totally deserve all the recognition, success, and respect! Everything in heaven and on earth belongs to you, and you rule over everything, Lord. You're like the ultimate leader, no one can compare! 12. You're the plug for both cash and clout, total boss status. You've got the power and strength to make things big and back everyone up. No doubt, you rule over everything. 13. Yo, God, we're hella grateful and we stan your lit name. 14. But like, who even are we, and why should we, like, be able to give so willingly, you know? 'Cause like, everything we have comes from you, and everything we give is actually just, like, yours to begin with. 15. Yo, we're like total outsiders in your sight, just passin' through, just like our ancestors did. Our time here on earth is like a fleeting shadow, no one sticks around for long. No expectations or anything. 16. Yo, our God, all this stuff we've prepped to build a sick crib for you and your holy name, it's all from you, like totally yours. 17. God, I understand that you test people's hearts and value their honesty. As for me, I wholeheartedly offer these things with sincerity. It brings me joy to see your people gathered here, willingly offering themselves to you. 18. Yo, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our OG ancestors, make sure this stays in the minds and hearts of your peeps forever. Get their hearts ready for you, ya feel? 19. And like, bless Solomon, my son, with a totally pure heart, so he can obey all your rules, follow your teachings, and do exactly what you want, including building that sick palace I've been planning. 20. And David was like, yo, everyone here, let's give mad props to the LORD your God. And all the people straight up showed respect and praised the LORD God of their ancestors, and humbly bowed their heads, and worshiped the LORD and the king. 21. So they like, went all out for the LORD and made mad sacrifices and burnt offerings the next day. They brought a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, along with their drink offerings. They made hella sacrifices for all of Israel. 22. And they totally grubbed down and had a lit feast in front of the LORD that day, like it was mega awesome. They even crowned Solomon, David's son, as king for the second time, and he was chosen by the LORD to be the ultimate leader. Zadok also got anointed as the priest, FYI. 23. So basically, Solomon took over as king after his dad, David, and things went pretty well. Everyone in Israel listened to him and followed his lead. 24. And all the cool dudes, the strong homies, and all the sons of King David were like, 'Yo, we're down with Solomon, the ultimate king.' 25. And God made Solomon super popular among all the peeps in Israel, and hooked him up with the dopest royal vibes that no other king in Israel had seen before. 26. So, like, David, who's, like, Jesse's son, totally ruled over all of Israel. 27. So, this dude ruled over Israel for like, forty whole years. He spent seven of those years in Hebron, and the remaining thirty-three in Jerusalem. Such a long time, man! 28. And he lived a long, fulfilled life, blessed with wealth, respect, and a high status. After his death, his son Solomon took over as ruler. 29. So, like, all the stuff that King David did, from beginning to end, you can find it in the books written by Samuel the seer, Nathan the prophet, and Gad the seer. They're basically, like, history books, you know? Like, they've got all the words and everything. 30. With all his power moves, flexes, and the clout he held, ruling over himself, Israel, and every kingdom out there. \n",
      "KJV: 1 Chronicles 291. Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, {is yet} young and tender, and the work {is} great: for the palace {is} not for man, but for the LORD God. 2. Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for {things to be made} of gold, and the silver for {things} of silver, and the brass for {things} of brass, the iron for {things} of iron, and wood for {things} of wood; onyx stones, and {stones} to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 3. Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, {which} I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house, 4. {Even} three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses {withal}: 5. The gold for {things} of gold, and the silver for {things} of silver, and for all manner of work {to be made} by the hands of artificers. And who {then} is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD? {consecrate his service: Heb. fill his hand} 6. Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly, 7. And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. 8. And they with whom {precious} stones were found gave {them} to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite. 9. Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy. 10. Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed {be} thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever. 11. Thine, O LORD, {is} the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all {that is} in the heaven and in the earth {is thine}; thine {is} the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all. 12. Both riches and honour {come} of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand {is} power and might; and in thine hand {it is} to make great, and to give strength unto all. 13. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. 14. But who {am} I, and what {is} my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things {come} of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. {be able: Heb. retain, or, obtain strength} {of thine...: Heb. of thine hand} 15. For we {are} strangers before thee, and sojourners, as {were} all our fathers: our days on the earth {are} as a shadow, and {there is} none abiding. {abiding: Heb. expectation} 16. O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name {cometh} of thine hand, and {is} all thine own. 17. I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee. {present: Heb. found} 18. O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee: {prepare: or, stablish} 19. And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all {these things}, and to build the palace, {for} the which I have made provision. 20. And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king. 21. And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, {even} a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, {and} a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 22. And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed {him} unto the LORD {to be} the chief governor, and Zadok {to be} priest. 23. Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. 24. And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. {submitted...: Heb. gave the hand under Solomon} 25. And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him {such} royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel. 26. Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 27. And the time that he reigned over Israel {was} forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three {years} reigned he in Jerusalem. 28. And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 29. Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they {are} written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, {book: or, history: Heb. words} 30. With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 11. So like, Solomon, David's son, totally became hella powerful in his kingdom. And, bro, the LORD his God was like, by his side 24/7, boosting him up and making him absolutely legendary. 2. So, Solomon talked to all the peeps in Israel - the big bosses, the judges, and the leaders, basically everyone important in the land. 3. So Solomon and all the squad rolled up to the high spot at Gibeon, 'cause that's where the lit hangout spot of God's gathering was. Moses, the ultimate servant of the LORD, came through and built it back in the wilderness. 4. But David brought up the ark of God from Kirjathjearim to the spot he prepared for it in Jerusalem, where he set up a tent for it. 5. And Bezaleel, the talented son of Uri, son of Hur, had crafted a rad bronze altar, which he placed in front of the LORD's tabernacle. So, Solomon and the whole crew were all about it! They were totally into it and sought its presence. *Note: It was there and all. 6. So Solomon went up to the sick altar in front of the LORD, which was at the chill gathering spot, and dropped a thousand lit offerings on it. 7. So, like, one night, God shows up to Solomon and is all like, 'Dude, ask me for anything you want and I'll hook you up.' 8. So, like, Solomon was talking to God and he was like, 'Yo, God! You've been super kind to my pops, David, and now you've totally hooked me up by making me the king after him.' 9. Yo, LORD God, you gotta come through with the promise you made to my dad David. You made me the king over a ton of people, I'm talking like crazy huge numbers, like the dust on the earth. (You know, a whole lot.) 10. Yo, hook me up with some mad wisdom and knowledge, so I can fully vibe with this crowd. Like, who's even qualified to make proper judgments for such an epic group? 11. And God was like, yo Solomon, I see you got a good heart and all. You ain't even askin' for money, fame, or power, and you don't even wanna take out your haters or live forever. All you want is wisdom and knowledge to be a good ruler for my people, 'cause I made you king and all that. 12. I'm hooking you up with mad wisdom and knowledge, and on top of that, you'll be swimming in stacks of riches, wealth, and mad respect. No king in the past or future will even come close to ballin' like you. 13. So Solomon arrived at this cool spot called Gibeon in Jerusalem, after chilling out with the people at the tabernacle. And that's when he officially became the ruler of all Israel. 14. So, like, Solomon got a bunch of chariots and horse dudes: he had, like, a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horse dudes. He set them up in these cities for chariots, and also kept some with him in Jerusalem. 15. The king went all out in Jerusalem, stacking up silver and gold like it was no big deal. He even had cedar trees brought in, just as many as the ones in the valley. It was like a never-ending supply! 16. So, like, Solomon got these sick horses from Egypt, and also some top-notch linen yarn. The King's merchants bought the linen yarn for a pretty good price, you know? Like, it was a good deal. These horses were totally Solomon's, by the way. Can't forget to mention that! 17. So they got themselves a sick ride from Egypt, a chariot worth 600 shekels of silver, and a dope horse for 150. They even hooked up the Hittite kings and the kings of Syria with some sick horses, thanks to their connections. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 11. And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom, and the LORD his God {was} with him, and magnified him exceedingly. 2. Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers. 3. So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that {was} at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness. 4. But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to {the place which} David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem. 5. Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it. {he put: or, was there} 6. And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD, which {was} at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it. 7. In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee. 8. And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead. 9. Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude. {like...: Heb. much as the dust of the earth} 10. Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, {that is so} great? 11. And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king: 12. Wisdom and knowledge {is} granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that {have been} before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like. 13. Then Solomon came {from his journey} to the high place that {was} at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and reigned over Israel. 14. And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 15. And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem {as plenteous} as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that {are} in the vale for abundance. {made: Heb. gave} 16. And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. {Solomon...: Heb. the going forth of the horses which was Solomon's} 17. And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred {shekels} of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so brought they out {horses} for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means. {means: Heb. hand} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 21. So, like, Solomon totally made up his mind to build a sick crib for the name of the LORD, you know, like a place to worship and stuff, and also a kickass pad for his kingdom. 2. So Solomon assigned 70k people to carry heavy stuff, 80k people to cut and shape rocks in the mountains, and 3.6k people to supervise them all. 3. So, Solomon hit up King Huram of Tyre and was like, 'Yo, remember how you helped out my dad David by sending him cedars to build his crib? Well, I'm on the same wave, so hook me up too!'} 4. Yo, listen up! I'm building a sick pad in honor of the LORD my God. Gonna dedicate it to Him and burn some dope incense, keep that bread fresh round the clock, and offer burnt sacrifices in the morning and evening. Oh, and don't forget the sabbaths, new moons, and epic feasts of our awesome God. This is a forever deal for Israel, ya feel? 5. Yo, the crib I'm building is straight fire, 'cause our God is the GOAT of all gods, no cap. 6. But, like, who can even build a house for God? I mean, even the heavens and the highest heavens can't contain Him. So, like, who am I to think that I can build Him a house, except maybe to offer sacrifices to Him? 7. Yo, I need someone who's hella skilled in crafting all kinds of bling. We're talking gold, silver, brass, iron – you name it. But wait, there's more! They gotta be able to do some sick engravings, like the pros back in Judah and Jerusalem. My dad David came through with the skilled homies – gotta keep up the legacy, fam! #ArtisticSkills 8. Hey, I need you to hook me up with some sick cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees from Lebanon. I know your crew is legit when it comes to handling timber in Lebanon. And check it, my squad will join your squad, like, team work makes the dream work, right? Oh, by the way, algum is also known as almuggim. Just so you know! 9. I need a ton of timber, like, a crazy amount, for this super amazing house I'm about to build. It's gonna be mind-blowingly epic, like, way beyond great. Seriously, it'll be legendary! 10. Yo, check it out, I'm hooking up your crew—those timber choppers—with 20K measures of prime wheat, 20K measures of barley, and 20K baths of wine and oil. It's gonna be lit! 11. So, like, King Huram of Tyre, he sent Solomon a message and was like, 'Yo, bro! The Lord straight up loves his peeps, so he chose you to be their king!' 12. Huram was like, yo, shoutout to the LORD God of Israel, the G.O.A.T who created the whole universe! He blessed David with a son who's super smart and wise, and totally equipped to build a sick house for the LORD and a rad kingdom crib. The son is all about that wisdom and understanding, you feel me? 13. And now I've sent a really smart dude, who's got mad skills and is wise, just like my dad, Huram! 14. The guy's mom was from the daughters of Dan and his dad was a skilled artist in working with gold, silver, brass, iron, stone, and timber. He could also handle purple, blue, fine linen, and crimson. He was a pro at all types of engravings and could come up with any kind of design that was thrown at him. He was up there with the skilled artists like the ones your dad King David had. 15. So like, the wheat, barley, oil, and wine that my Lord talked about, he should totally send them to his peeps, you know? 16. And we're gonna get some wood from Lebanon, like, as much as you need, and we'll ship it to you on some fancy floats all the way to Joppa. Then you can haul it up to Jerusalem and do your thing. {basically, as much as you need} {Joppa: or should I say, Japho} 17. So, Solomon decided to count all the foreigners living in Israel, just like his dad David had done before. Guess what? There were a whopping total of 150,306 of them! Can you believe it? (By the way, when I say 'foreigners,' I mean those dudes who weren't originally from Israel, ya know? Just clarifying, in case you were wondering.) 18. And he assigned 70,000 of them to carry heavy stuff, and 80,000 to chop wood in the mountains, and 3,600 supervisors to manage the workers. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 21. And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom. 2. And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them. 3. And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein, {even so deal with me}. {Huram: or, Hiram} 4. Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate {it} to him, {and} to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This {is an ordinance} for ever to Israel. {sweet...: Heb. incense of spices} 5. And the house which I build {is} great: for great {is} our God above all gods. 6. But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who {am} I then, that I should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before him? {is able: Heb. hath retained, or, obtained strength} 7. Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson, and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that {are} with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father did provide. {to grave: Heb. to grave gravings} 8. Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants {shall be} with thy servants, {algum: also called, almuggim} 9. Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I am about to build {shall be} wonderful great. {wonderful...: Heb. great and wonderful} 10. And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil. 11. Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath made thee king over them. 12. Huram said moreover, Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom. {endued...: Heb. knowing prudence and understanding} 13. And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding, of Huram my father's, 14. The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father {was} a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord David thy father. 15. Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his servants: 16. And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa; and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem. {as much...: Heb according to all thy need} {Joppa: Heb. Japho} 17. And Solomon numbered all the strangers that {were} in the land of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred. {the strangers: Heb. the men the strangers} 18. And he set threescore and ten thousand of them {to be} bearers of burdens, and fourscore thousand {to be} hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 31. So, Solomon started constructing the crib for the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah. This was the same spot where the LORD appeared to David, his pops, at that place David had set up shop on Ornan the Jebusite's threshing floor. (Ornan was also known as Araunah.) 2. And he started building on the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. 3. So here's what Solomon learned when he was getting ready to build God's house. The length of the house was 60 cubits, and the width was 20 cubits. (In case you're wondering, a cubit is a unit of measurement!) 4. The front porch of the house had the same length as the house itself, measuring twenty cubits, and it stood tall at one hundred and twenty cubits. And it was beautifully adorned with pure gold on the inside. 5. And he covered the bigger pad with lit fir wood, then added some dope gold coating on top, and decked it out with palm trees and chains. 6. He decked out the house with mad bling to make it look fly: all the gold he used was straight flexin' Parvaim gold. #deckedout 7. He flexed on the whole crib, covering its walls, doors, posts, and beams with solid gold. And to take it up another level, he even carved some sick angelic figures on those walls. 8. And like, he built this super holy place, and it was like, the same length as the whole house, which was like twenty cubits long, and also twenty cubits wide. And he totally covered it in fancy gold, like, six hundred talents worth of it. 9. And like, the nails were legit made of fifty shekels of gold. And dude totally coated the upper chambers in gold, man. 10. And in the super dope holy crib, he crafted two angel dudes with sick artwork and coated them with gold. {image...: or, (like some peeps believe) with movable swag} 11. And the wings of the cherubims were super long, like 20 cubits: one wing of one cherub was five cubits, reaching all the way to the wall of the house. And the other wing was also five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. 12. And one of the wings of the other cherub was like, super long - about five cubits! It reached all the way to the wall of the house. And the other wing was also five cubits long, totally connecting to the wing of the other cherub. 13. These cherubims had their wings spread out to twenty cubits, chillin' on their feet with their faces pointed towards the house. 14. So, like, he created this curtain thingy with a cool combo of blue, purple, and crimson fabric, made out of the finest linen, and bonus points - he even added some dope cherubims on it. Mind blown! Aww yeah, he totally nailed the design! 15. He also built two pillars in front of the house, and each one stood thirty-five cubits tall. The fancy decoration on the top of each pillar measured up to five cubits high! 16. He hooked up some rad chains, kinda like in a super cool secret temple, and put them on top of the mega pillars. Then he added a hundred juicy pomegranates and hung them on the chains. Talk about major style! 17. And he set up these big columns right in front of the temple, one on the right side and the other on the left side. And he named the one on the right 'Jachin' which means 'He shall establish', and the one on the left 'Boaz' which means 'In it is strength'. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 31. Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where {the LORD} appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. {where...: or, which was seen of David his father} {Ornan: also called, Araunah} 2. And he began to build in the second {day} of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign. 3. Now these {are the things wherein} Solomon was instructed for the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after the first measure {was} threescore cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. {instructed: Heb. founded} 4. And the porch that {was} in the front {of the house}, the length {of it was} according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height {was} an hundred and twenty: and he overlaid it within with pure gold. 5. And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains. 6. And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold {was} gold of Parvaim. {garnished: Heb. covered} 7. He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved cherubims on the walls. 8. And he made the most holy house, the length whereof {was} according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine gold, {amounting} to six hundred talents. 9. And the weight of the nails {was} fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold. 10. And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work, and overlaid them with gold. {image...: or, (as some think) of moveable work} 11. And the wings of the cherubims {were} twenty cubits long: one wing {of the one cherub was} five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing {was likewise} five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub. 12. And {one} wing of the other cherub {was} five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house: and the other wing {was} five cubits {also}, joining to the wing of the other cherub. 13. The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces {were} inward. {inward: or, toward the house} 14. And he made the vail {of} blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon. {wrought: Heb. caused to ascend} 15. Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high, and the chapiter that {was} on the top of each of them {was} five cubits. {high: Heb. long} 16. And he made chains, {as} in the oracle, and put {them} on the heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and put {them} on the chains. 17. And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz. {Jachin: that is, He shall establish} {Boaz: that is, In it is strength} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 41. He also flexed and built a sick bronze altar, measuring 20 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 10 cubits tall. 2. He, like, created this super cool giant bowl thingy that was like ten cubits wide all around and five cubits tall. And there was this line that like went all the way around it and it was, like, thirty cubits long. So epic, right?! 3. And there were these oxen things all around it, like a circle. There were ten of them in every meter, going all around this huge sea thing. And they made two lines of oxen when they made it. 4. There were twelve oxen holding it up: three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was placed on top of them and their backs were turned inward. 5. The edge of it was about as thick as a hand, and the rim looked like an intricately designed cup, adorned with lily flowers. It could hold up to three thousand baths. 6. And he also made ten sinks, placing five on the right side and five on the left, for people to wash their offerings for the burnt sacrifice. But the huge sink was specifically for the priests to cleanse themselves in. (That's what they used when they were making burnt offerings.) 7. So, like, he totally crafted ten sick gold candlesticks, you know? And he put them in the temple, with five on the right side and five on the left side. It was all about the perfect vibes and symmetry! 8. He also made ten tables and put them inside the temple, five on the right side and five on the left. He made a hundred gold bowls as well. 9. And he also created a sick hangout spot for the priests, and a lit courtyard where everyone could chill. Plus, he hooked up the entrance with some dope brass doors. 10. And he placed the fancy pool thingy on the right side of the fancy temple, facing towards the sunny side. 11. And Huram made all the cool pottery stuff for King Solomon's swaggy house of God. He had mad skills in crafting pots, shovels, and even bowls. Huram totally nailed it and completed all the sick work he had to do. #SkillsOnFleek 12. Okay, so there were these two big pillars with fancy decorations on top. And to make them even cooler, there were these two wreaths covering the decorations. It was all on the top of the pillars, you know? 13. There were 400 pomegranates in total, with 2 rows of pomegranates on each wreath. They were there to adorn the tops of the pillars. (upon the pillars means on the surface) 14. He also made some sick bases, and put sick lavers on top of those bases; (lavers means like caldrons) 15. There was this dope AF setup with a huge lit pool and twelve sick oxen underneath it. 16. Huram's dad, a skilled craftsman, hooked Solomon up with some sick kitchenware and cooking utensils. Everything was made out of shiny brass for the LORD's crib. #blingbling 17. The king yeeted them down in the Jordan area, on the thick clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah. 18. So, like, Solomon went all out and made a ton of stuff, man. I mean, there was so much brass that they couldn't even figure out how heavy it was. Insane, right? 19. So Solomon totally hooked up the crib for God's house, like he made all the fancy gold altar and the tables for the show-off bread, you know? 20. Also, the lit-up candles with their cool lamps, they were meant to burn in a super rad way right in front of the sacred place, made of pure gold and all. 21. He crafted the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs from pure gold, the finest gold there is. 22. And there were these cool things made of pure gold: snuffers, basons (or you can call them bowls if you want), spoons, and censers. And guess what? Even the entry of the house, the inner doors of the super holy place, and the doors of the temple were gold! Talk about fancy! \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 41. Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits the height thereof. 2. Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. {from...: Heb. from his brim to his brim} 3. And under it {was} the similitude of oxen, which did compass it round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of oxen {were} cast, when it was cast. 4. It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea {was set} above upon them, and all their hinder parts {were} inward. 5. And the thickness of it {was} an handbreadth, and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; {and} it received and held three thousand baths. {with flowers...: or, like a lilyflower} 6. He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea {was} for the priests to wash in. {such...: Heb. the work of burnt offering} 7. And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and set {them} in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left. 8. He made also ten tables, and placed {them} in the temple, five on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of gold. {basons: or, bowls} 9. Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with brass. 10. And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over against the south. 11. And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the house of God; {basons: or, bowls} {finished: Heb. finished to make} 12. {To wit}, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters {which were} on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which {were} on the top of the pillars; 13. And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which {were} upon the pillars. {upon: Heb. upon the face of} 14. He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases; {lavers: or, caldrons} 15. One sea, and twelve oxen under it. 16. The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the house of the LORD of bright brass. {bright: Heb. made bright, or, scoured} 17. In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredathah. {clay...: Heb. thicknesses of the ground} 18. Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the weight of the brass could not be found out. 19. And Solomon made all the vessels that {were for} the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread {was set}; 20. Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold; 21. And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, {made he of} gold, {and} that perfect gold; {perfect...: Heb. perfections of gold} 22. And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers, {of} pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors thereof for the most holy {place}, and the doors of the house of the temple, {were of} gold. {basons: or, bowls} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 51. So, like, Solomon completed everything he did for the house of the LORD. He brought in all the stuff that his dad David had dedicated - you know, the silver, the gold, and all the instruments - and he put them with the treasures of God's house. 2. So Solomon got all the OGs of Israel, and the leaders of the tribes, the top dawgs of the Israelite fam, to pull up to Jerusalem and bring the ark of the LORD's covenant out of the city of David, also known as Zion. 3. So all the dudes from Israel gathered up and pulled up on the king's party in the seventh month. 4. So like, all the boomers of Israel showed up, and the Levites were there to lift up the ark. 5. So they brought up the ark, and the fancy tent where they all gather, and all the sacred stuff that was in the fancy tent. The priests and the Levites were the ones who brought it all up. 6. King Solomon and all of Israel gathered before the ark and offered so many sheep and oxen that they couldn't even keep count. It was like a never-ending feast! 7. Then the priests brought in the sacred chest of the LORD to its spot, right inside the super holy place, under the cool wings of the angel dudes: 8. The cherubims flexed their wings over the spot where the ark was, covering it entirely along with its poles. 9. And they pulled out the poles {of the ark}, so that the ends of the poles could be seen sticking out from the ark in front of the sacred place, but they couldn't be seen from the outside. And it's still like that even today. {there...: or, they are there} 10. The only things inside the ark were the two tablets that Moses placed there at Horeb when God made a covenant with the Israelites after they left Egypt. 11. And it happened, when the priests came out of the holy spot: (because all the priests who were there were set apart, and they didn't have to wait their turn: found ) 12. And the Levite squad, made up of the singers Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their crew, all dressed up in fresh white threads, rockin' cymbals, psalteries, and harps, they stationed themselves on the east side of the altar. And alongside them, a fierce squad of 120 priests bustin' out sick trumpet sounds! 🎺 13. And something amazing happened when the trumpeters and singers joined together to make one awesome sound of praise and thanks to the LORD. They raised their voices along with trumpets, cymbals, and other cool music instruments, all to worship and acknowledge the goodness and everlasting mercy of the LORD. And guess what? The whole house became filled with a thick cloud, like the house of the LORD was on fire or something! 14. Like, the priests couldn't even handle their duties because of this epic cloud situation, man. It was all because the Lord's glory had completely taken over the house of God. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 51. Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in {all} the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God. 2. Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which {is} Zion. 3. Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which {was} in the seventh month. 4. And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark. 5. And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that {were} in the tabernacle, these did the priests {and} the Levites bring up. 6. Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 7. And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy {place, even} under the wings of the cherubims: 8. For the cherubims spread forth {their} wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. 9. And they drew out the staves {of the ark}, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day. {there...: or, they are there} 10. {There was} nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put {therein} at Horeb, when the LORD made {a covenant} with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt. {when the LORD: or, where, etc} 11. And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy {place}: (for all the priests {that were} present were sanctified, {and} did not {then} wait by course: {present: Heb. found} 12. Also the Levites {which were} the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, {being} arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:) 13. It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers {were} as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up {their} voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, {saying}, For {he is} good; for his mercy {endureth} for ever: that {then} the house was filled with a cloud, {even} the house of the LORD; 14. So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 61. So Solomon was like, 'Yo, the LORD said He's gonna chill in some dark vibes.' 2. Yo, I've totally constructed a sick crib for you—a permanent hangout spot where you'll always feel at home, no doubt. 3. Then the king looked at everyone and gave them his blessings: and all of Israel stood in awe. 4. And he was like, OMG, the LORD God of Israel is so blessed! He totally made good on what he promised my dad David, you know, actually doing it with his own hands after saying it! 5. Ever since I rescued my peeps from Egypt, I didn't pick any city in Israel to be the spot for my crib, just so my name could be chillin' there. And I didn't choose any dude to be the big boss over my people, Israel. 6. But I totally picked Jerusalem as, like, the place where I want my name to be known, you know? And I specifically chose David to lead my people, Israel. #ChosenOnes 7. So, like, David, my dad, really wanted to build, you know, a sick crib for the LORD God of Israel. It was all up in his heart, man. 8. But God was like, David, my dude, I see you wanted to build a sick crib for me and that's pretty awesome. You did good having that desire in your heart, man. 9. But, like, you can't be the one to build the crib, ya know? It's gonna be your kid, straight from your bloodline, who's gonna take care of it and make it a dope place in my name. 10. So, like, God totally did what He said He would do. He made sure I, the new king after my dad David, took my rightful place on the throne of Israel, just like the LORD promised. And guess what? I even went ahead and built this amazing house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. 11. And I've placed the ark in it, where the Lord's covenant with the kids of Israel is kept, you know? 12. And he like, totally stood up in front of the LORD's altar, with all the Israel peeps watching, and threw his hands out like, whoa! 13. So Solomon built this cool bronze platform, it was like 5 cubits long, 5 cubits wide, and 3 cubits high. He put it right in the middle of the court. Then he climbed up on it and got down on his knees in front of all the people of Israel. With his hands raised towards the sky, he started praying! 14. And were like, OMG, LORD God of Israel, you're, like, the most unique God ever, in the whole heaven and earth. You totally keep your promises and show so much love to your loyal servants who, like, totally dedicate themselves to you with all their hearts. So awesome! 15. Yo, you totally came through for my dad David, just like you said you would! You spoke it, and then you made it happen, just like today, man! 16. So, like, God of Israel, please make sure to keep the promise you made to my father David, ya know? You said there will always be someone from his lineage ruling over Israel, but, like, only if his descendants are actually, like, following your laws, just how you've walked before us. We really don't want anyone to be, like, cut off or anything.  17. Yo, God of Israel, it's time to make your promises come true! You said those words to your servant David, so let it happen. 18. Wait, so like, is God really gonna come chill with us humans on this planet? Dude, even the whole universe can't contain Him, so like, this house I built is way too small for Him, no cap! 19. Yo, God, listen up and show some respect to your servant's prayer and supplication. Hear the cry and prayer this servant be throwin' down before You, O LORD my God. 20. So, like, keep an eye on this place all the time, where you said you'd put your name. Listen to the prayers of your servant who's praying towards this place. {or, like, in this place} 21. Listen up to the prayers of your servant and the people of Israel, as they direct them towards this spot. Listen to them from your crib up in the clouds, and when you hear their voices, forgive them. 22. If someone messes up with their neighbor and they have to swear an oath, and that whole oath stuff happens in front of the altar in this house; 23. So, like, pay attention up there in Heaven, and take some action, and like, make fair judgments on your peeps. Give the wicked what they deserve, like, make them face the consequences of their actions. And, yeah, make things right for the righteous, like, reward them according to their goodness. 24. And if your squad Israel gets wrecked by the enemy, because they messed up against you; but then they come back, admit they were wrong, and start praying and begging you in this spot; 25. So, listen up, man! I'm hoping you'll hear me out from up above and forgive all the wrongs that your peeps, the Israelites, have done. And I'm asking you, if it's not too much trouble, to bring them back to the land that you promised to them and their ancestors. Thanks, bro! 26. When the sky is closed off and there's no rain because they messed up; but if they pray in this spot, own up to their mistakes, and stop doing wrong when you punish them; 27. Yo, listen up! God, if you're up there, please forgive us, your servants, and the peeps of Israel when you've shown us the right path to follow. Also, can you bless our land with some much-needed rain? After all, it's the place you gave to your people as an inheritance. Thanks, fam! 28. If, like, there's, like, a major shortage of stuff in the land, or if there's, like, a crazy widespread disease going on, or if there's, like, serious devastating natural disasters happening, with, like, locusts everywhere and caterpillers wrecking everything. And also, if their enemies surround them and attack their cities and stuff. Basically, if any kind of bad stuff is going down, whether it's a super intense illness or any other kind of trouble, you know, in their cities or wherever in their land, then, like, it's a really tough situation. 29. So like, whenever someone prays or asks for something, like anyone from the cool peeps of Israel, when they're feeling super down and pouring their hearts out, raising their hands in this house, or you know, toward this place: 30. So, like, listen up from your heavenly pad and like, forgive and give everyone what they deserve based on their actions, 'cause you totally know what's up with their hearts (cus, let's be real, only you know what's inside us humans' hearts, ya know?) 31. So that they'll have mad respect for you and follow your path their whole lives while living in the land you gave to our ancestors. {all the days which...: in other words, like forever} {in the land: like, on the whole planet} 32. And yo, about the stranger, who ain't even from your crew in Israel, but came from a serious distance because of your dope name and your incredible power; if they roll up and start praying in this spot, no doubt; 33. So, like, listen up from your heavenly crib and do whatever this random dude asks of you. This way, everyone on earth will know your name and respect you, just like your homies in Israel. And they'll also know that this rad house I built is dedicated to you. #blessed 34. If your squad rolls out to battle their enemies in the direction you send them, and they  hit you up with some prayers towards this lit city you picked, and the dope house I built in your name; 35. Then listen, like, from Heaven to their prayer and their plea, and totally support their cause. #justice 36. If they mess up and make a mistake (because let's be real, we all do), and you get mad at them and let their enemies take them prisoner to a faraway or nearby place; when I say take them prisoner, I mean they really take them prisoner. 37. But if they actually stop and think about it in the place where they're taken as prisoners, and they decide to turn around and send up a prayer to you in that place, saying, 'We messed up, we've done wrong, and we've been really bad in our actions'; 38. If they fully come back to you, like, with all their heart and soul, even in that faraway place where they're being held captive, and they pray towards the land you promised their ancestors, and towards the city you picked, and towards the temple I built for you, God... 39. So, like, God, listen up from your heavenly crib to their prayer and supplications. Make sure to have their backs, and forgive your people who messed up and sinned against you. #justiceforall 40. Yo God, listen up! Open your eyes and tune in to the prayer happening right here. Take a moment, give a listen, ya know? 41. Yo, God, it's time to chill out and find your spot to kick back. Bring yourself and your powerful vibes with the ark of strength. And make sure your crew of priests stays lit with salvation, and let your loyal peeps celebrate all the goodness. 42. Yo, God, don't ignore your chosen one: think about all the good stuff you did for David, your servant. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 61. Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness. 2. But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place for thy dwelling for ever. 3. And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel stood. 4. And he said, Blessed {be} the LORD God of Israel, who hath with his hands fulfilled {that} which he spake with his mouth to my father David, saying, 5. Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel: 6. But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and have chosen David to be over my people Israel. 7. Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 8. But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in that it was in thine heart: 9. Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house for my name. 10. The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 11. And in it have I put the ark, wherein {is} the covenant of the LORD, that he made with the children of Israel. 12. And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands: 13. For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, of five cubits long, and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven, {long...: Heb. the length thereof, etc} 14. And said, O LORD God of Israel, {there is} no God like thee in the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and {shewest} mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with all their hearts: 15. Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled {it} with thine hand, as {it is} this day. 16. Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me. {There...: Heb. There shall not a man be cut off} 17. Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified, which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David. 18. But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built! 19. Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee: 20. That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place. {toward...: or, in this place} 21. Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, {even} from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive. {make: Heb. pray} {toward...: or, in this place} 22. If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house; {and an oath...: Heb. and he require an oath of him} 23. Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness. 24. And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy, because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee in this house; {be put...: or, be smitten} {in: or, toward} 25. Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers. 26. When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned against thee; {yet} if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them; {toward...: or, in this place} 27. Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance. 28.

Then hear thou from the heavens, {even} from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as {doth} thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name. {this...: Heb. thy name is called upon this house} 34. If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name; 35. Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause. {cause: or, right} 36. If they sin against thee, (for {there is} no man which sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over before {their} enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near; {they carry them away captives: Heb. they that take them captives carry them away} 37. Yet {if} they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss, and have dealt wickedly; {bethink...: Heb. bring back to their heart} 38. If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, and {toward} the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name: 39. Then hear thou from the heavens, {even} from thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee. {cause: or, right} 40.

      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 71. So, like, when Solomon finished praying, this insane thing happened: fire came down from heaven and totally burned up the burnt offering and sacrifices. And to top it all off, the glory of the LORD filled the entire house! 2. Yo, the priests couldn't even step inside the crib of the LORD, man. His glory straight up filled up the whole place, you feel me? 3. And like, when all the Israelite squad peeped the lit fire drop and the glorious presence of the LORD on the crib, they straight up bowed down on the ground like total legends. They started worshiping and giving mad props to the LORD, saying how dope He is 'cause His mercy is forever, yo. 4. So the king and everyone dipped into some lit offerings for the LORD. 5. So King Solomon went all out and offered a massive sacrifice, with 22k oxen and a whopping 120k sheep! It was a major event, and both the king and all the people joined in dedicating the house of God. 6. So, the priests were doing their priestly duties, and the Levites were there too, rocking out with musical instruments that King David had made specifically to worship the LORD and show off His never-ending mercy. Whenever David praised God and the Levites played their music, the priests would blast their trumpets, and all the people of Israel would stand tall. 7. Solomon made the center of the courtyard in front of the Lord's house sacred. He offered burnt sacrifices and the choice parts of the peace offerings there, since the bronze altar Solomon had made wasn't big enough to handle all the burnt sacrifices, grain offerings, and fat. 8. So like, Solomon threw this lit party that lasted seven whole days, and all of Israel turned up - like, seriously, there were hella people! From as far as Hamath to the river of Egypt, the whole squad was there. 9. And on the eighth day, they had a massive gathering: because they celebrated the dedication of the altar for a whole week, and continued the party for seven days. {a solemn...: meaning, they put a lot of effort into it} 10. And on the 23rd day of the 7th month, dude was like, 'Alright, y'all can head back to your tents!' Everyone was stoked and super hyped because the LORD had shown mad love to David, Solomon, and all the peeps of Israel. 11. So, like, Solomon totally finished building the house for the LORD and the king's crib, you know? And he totally made all the cool stuff that he wanted to in both the house of the LORD and his own crib. He was, like, super successful and totally nailed it, you know? 12. So, like, the LORD showed up to Solomon while he was chilling in his bed, and was like, 'Yo, I heard your prayer and I'm picking this spot for my crib where we can sacrifice and stuff.' 13. If I, like, close off the sky so it doesn't rain or tell all the locusts to chow down on the land, or make diseases go crazy among my peeps; 14. If my squad, who reps my name, can get real and down-to-earth, hit me up with their prayers, genuinely seek my vibe, and leave behind their messed-up ways; that's when I'll tune in from the heavenly realm, forgive their wrongdoings, and bring healing to their territory. {who reps...: Hebrew - representing my name} 15. Okay, listen up fam! I'm about to be all attentive to the prayers y'all be making in this spot. My eyes and ears are wide open, ready to hear what you gotta say. #Blessed 16. Yo, I've straight-up chosen and blessed this crib, so that my name can be there forever. And like, my eyes and my heart will be there for real, like, always. 17. And for you, if you're down to live your life like David your dad did, following all my rules and laws, and being cool with my commands and decisions; 18. I'll totally establish your kingdom's throne, just like I promised your dad David. There's always gonna be a ruler in Israel, no doubt about it. Trust me, it's gonna be epic! 19. But, like, if you straight up ditch my rules and the things I told you to do, which I made super clear, and you decide to start worshiping other gods instead, then, yeah... 20. I'm gonna totally uproot them from the land I gave 'em, and this crib that I made sacred for myself, I'm gonna kick it outta my sight. It's gonna become a mad famous saying and a sick nickname everywhere. 21. And this lit house is gonna blow everyone's mind when they see it pass by, like, seriously, they'll be like, whoa, why did the LORD do this crazy thing to this place and this house? 22. And like, the reason this is all happening is because they totally ditched the LORD God who freed them from Egypt, and instead started following all these other gods and idolizing them. They were super into it, like serving them and everything. So, basically, that's why they're going through all this evil stuff. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 71. Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house. 2. And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD'S house. 3. And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, {saying}, For {he is} good; for his mercy {endureth} for ever. 4. Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD. 5. And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. 6. And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy {endureth} for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood. {by their...: Heb. by their hand} 7. Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that {was} before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat. 8. Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt. 9. And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days. {a solemn...: Heb. a restraint} 10. And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people. 11. Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected. 12. And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice. 13. If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people; 14. If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land. {which...: Heb. upon whom my name is called} 15. Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the prayer {that is made} in this place. {unto...: Heb. to the prayer of this place} 16. For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. 17. And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments; 18. Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man {to be} ruler in Israel. {There...: Heb. There shall not be cut off to thee} 19. But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them; 20. Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it {to be} a proverb and a byword among all nations. 21. And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house? 22. And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 81. After 20 freaking years, Solomon finished building the crib for the LORD and his own sick pad, 2. So, like, Huram had fixed up these cities for Solomon, right? And Solomon, being the boss that he is, actually went ahead and built them up even more. He even hooked up the kids of Israel with some sweet places to call home there. 3. So, like, Solomon totally rolled up to Hamathzobah and totally dominated it. Epic win! 4. And he totally flexed by constructing Tadmor out in the middle of nowhere, along with all those sick storage cities he built in Hamath. 5. He also created Bethhoron the higher and Bethhoron the lower, fortified cities with walls, gates, and bars. 6. And Baalath and all the super cool cities that King Solomon had, along with the sweet chariot cities and the rad horsemen cities, and every single thing that Solomon wanted to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and all his land. (This includes everything that Solomon really, really wanted to build.) 7. So, basically, there were still some Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites left, but they weren't part of Israel, ya know? 8. So basically, Solomon made the children of Israel's leftovers pay up till now. Ya know, those kids who were still hanging around in the land after their parents were gone? Yeah, they had to cough up some tribute for Solomon. Talk about a never-ending debt! 9. Yo, Solomon straight up didn't recruit no servants from the children of Israel for his projects. Nah, he just had guys who were all about that warrior life, leading his squads and riding in his sick chariots and horsemobiles. 10. So, like, these were the top dudes in King Solomon's crew, there were, like, 250 of them, and they were totally in charge of the people, you know? 11. So Solomon took Pharaoh's daughter from the city of David to his own crib that he built for her. He didn't want his wifey living in King David's pad 'cause that place is straight up sacred, where the LORD's ark is kept. 🔥 12. So Solomon busted out some sick burnt offerings to the LORD on the LORD's altar, the one he built by the front porch. 13. Like, every single day and stuff, they had to give offerings and follow Moses' commandment and stuff. And on the sabbaths, new moons, and big fancy feasts, they had to do it three times a year. Like, during the feast of unleavened bread, the feast of weeks, and the feast of tabernacles. 14. So, he chose priests and Levites, following his father David's instructions, to perform their duties. Their responsibilities included praising and assisting the priests, as required every day. The gatekeepers were also assigned to their respective gates, following the command of David, a man of God. 15. And they totally listened to the king's command about everything and didn't question the priests and Levites or the precious stuff. 16. So, like, everything that Solomon was doin' went on until the day when the house of the LORD was built, and they kept at it until it was all done. And, yo, the house of the LORD was, like, totally perfect then! 17. So Solomon headed over to Eziongeber and Eloth, which is by the sea in the land of Edom. (FYI, Eloth is also known as Elath.) 18. Huram sent ships and skilled sailors to help Solomon's servants. They all sailed to Ophir together and brought back a whopping four hundred and fifty talents of gold for King Solomon. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 81. And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house, 2. That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there. 3. And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it. 4. And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath. 5. Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether, fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars; 6. And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion. {all that...: Heb. all the desire of Solomon which he desired to build} 7. {As for} all the people {that were} left of the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which {were} not of Israel, 8. {But} of their children, who were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon make to pay tribute until this day. 9. But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for his work; but they {were} men of war, and chief of his captains, and captains of his chariots and horsemen. 10. And these {were} the chief of king Solomon's officers, {even} two hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people. 11. And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because {the places are} holy, whereunto the ark of the LORD hath come. {holy: Heb. holiness} 12. Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch, 13. Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, {even} in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles. 14. And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God commanded. {so had David...: Heb. so was the commandment of David the man of God} 15. And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning the treasures. 16. Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was finished. {So} the house of the LORD was perfected. 17. Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom. {Eloth: also called, Elath} 18. And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought {them} to king Solomon. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 91. So, like, when the queen of Sheba heard about how awesome Solomon was, she totally rolled up to Jerusalem with a massive squad and, like, a bunch of camels carrying spices, gold, and precious stones. And once she reached Solomon, she had this deep convo about everything on her mind. It was legit. 2. So, Solomon answered all her questions, and there was literally nothing that Solomon didn't tell her. No secrets here. 3. So, the queen of Sheba checked out Solomon's vibes and saw how wise he was, along with the lit house he built. 4. And like, the food he served, and the way his crew sat, and how his homies looked after him, and what they wore; also, his squad of cupbearers and their drip; and the entrance he used to go into the house of the LORD; it was just too much for her to handle, she was overwhelmed. 5. Yo, I gotta tell you, King, I heard some straight facts about your stuff and how smart you are, all the way in my own hood. Word on the street is legit! 6. But I didn't believe what they were saying until I actually saw it with my own eyes. And let me tell you, the rumors don't even do justice to half of how amazing your wisdom is. You totally surpassed your reputation, dude. 7. Blessed are your squad, and blessed are those who stay loyal by your side, always hyped up by your wisdom. 8. Praise the LORD your God, who is totally stoked to have chosen you as king and put you on the throne. Your God is all about showing love to Israel and making sure they are set up for success. That’s why you’re their king, to make fair decisions and bring about justice. 9. And the queen hooked up the king big-time with a hundred and twenty talents of gold, tons of spicy stuff, and mad precious stones. No one else came close to the queen of Sheba's spice game for sure. 10. So, like, Huram's crew and Solomon's crew, they brought back mad gold from Ophir, plus some lit algum trees and precious stones. Oh, BTW, algum trees are also known as almug trees, just FYI. 11. And the king used algum trees to build platforms at the house of the LORD and the king's palace. He also had harps and psalteries for the singers, which were super cool and had never been seen before in the land of Judah. (terraces: or, stairs: Heb. highways) 12. And like, King Solomon totally hooked up the queen of Sheba with whatever she wanted, no cap. He gave her everything she asked for, except for the stuff she already brought for the king, ya know? So then she bounced and went back to her own land with her crew. 13. In just one year, Solomon gathered a huge amount of bling, totaling six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold. Can you even imagine? That's some serious flex, no cap. 14. Besides the stuff traders and merchants brought, even the coolest kings of Arabia and the big shots in the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. BTW, those governors were basically like captains. 15. And like, King Solomon totally flexed with making 200 golden shields. Each shield was like made from 600 shekels of pure gold, no joke. 16. He made 300 super cool gold shields, each shield made with 300 gold shekels. The king placed them all in this epic place called the House of the Forest of Lebanon. 17. The king flexed and built this sick throne made outta ivory, totally dripping with pure gold. 18. So, like, the throne had these like six steps, you know? And there was a super fancy gold footstool attached to the throne. And on each side, there were these cool support things, like hands or whatever, and two fierce lions standing by them. Rawr! 19. And yo, there were these twelve fierce lions chillin' on one side and the other side, like, they were straight up posted on these six legit steps. No other kingdom could match up to this level of awesomeness, fam. 20. Dude, check it out! King Solomon had all these sick gold drinking cups, and even the furniture in his palace made from pure gold. Like, no silver at all, man. It wasn't even worth mentioning back in the day of Solomon, you know? 21. So, like, the king's ships went to Tarshish with Huram's crew, ya know? And every three years like clockwork, the ships of Tarshish would cruise back with all sorts of swag: gold, silver, ivory, elephants' teeth, monkeys, and even peacocks! Pretty epic loot, if you ask me. 22. And King Solomon flexed on all the other kings in the world with his huge wealth and mad smarts. 23. All the influencers and famous peeps from around the world were totally thirsty for a meet and greet with King Solomon, just to soak up his insane wisdom that God blessed him with. 24. And they all came and brought their gifts to show off, including silver and gold stuff, fancy clothes, cool weapons, sweet-smelling things, horses, and even some flashy rides, every single year. 25. So, like Solomon had, uh, 4000 spots for horses and chariots and 12,000 horse dudes. He had 'em chillin' in the horse cities and kickin' it with the king in Jerusalem. 26. Yo, this dude was the boss over all the kings, like from the river all the way to Philistine territory and Egypt's border. By river, we mean the Euphrates, just so you know. 27. The king flexed in Jerusalem with stacks of silver, and he flexed even harder with cedar trees, making them just as plentiful as sycomore trees in the low plains. It was a major flex, no cap. #Blessed 28. So, they basically got Solomon some sick horses straight outta Egypt and from all over the place. 29. So, like, all the other stuff that Solomon did, you know, from start to finish, it's all written down in this book by this dude named Nathan, who was a prophet. And there's also some prophecies from this guy Ahijah the Shilonite, and like, visions from this seer called Iddo, all about Jeroboam, Nebat's son, you know? It's all in there, man. Hashtag book of Hebrew words, if that's your thing. 30. So, like, Solomon took over in Jerusalem and ruled the whole of Israel for a solid forty years, fam. 31. And Solomon passed away, and he was laid to rest in the city of David, his father. Then Rehoboam, his son, took over as ruler. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 91. And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. 2. And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing hid from Solomon which he told her not. 3. And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon, and the house that he had built, 4. And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her. {cupbearers: or, butlers} 5. And she said to the king, {It was} a true report which I heard in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom: {report: Heb. word} {acts: or, sayings} 6. Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen {it}: and, behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me: {for} thou exceedest the fame that I heard. 7. Happy {are} thy men, and happy {are} these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom. 8. Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, {to be} king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice. 9. And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon. 10. And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon, which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and precious stones. {algum...: also called, almug trees} 11. And the king made {of} the algum trees terraces to the house of the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land of Judah. {terraces: or, stairs: Heb. highways} 12. And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside {that} which she had brought unto the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants. 13. Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; 14. Beside {that which} chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. {governors: or, captains} 15. And king Solomon made two hundred targets {of} beaten gold: six hundred {shekels} of beaten gold went to one target. 16. And three hundred shields {made he of} beaten gold: three hundred {shekels} of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 17. Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. 18. And {there were} six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, {which were} fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays: {stays: Heb. hands} 19. And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom. 20. And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon {were of} gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon {were of} pure gold: none {were of} silver; it was {not} any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon. {pure: Heb. shut up} {none were of silver: or, there was no silver in them} 21. For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. {ivory: or, elephants' teeth} 22. And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. 23. And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart. 24. And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 25. And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. 26. And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. {river: that is, Euphrates} 27. And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that {are} in the low plains in abundance. {made silver: Heb. gave silver} 28. And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands. 29. Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, {are} they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat? {book: Heb. words} 30. And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. 31. And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 101. So Rehoboam went to Shechem because all of Israel had gathered there to make him king. 2. So, like, when Jeroboam, Nebat's son, who was hiding out in Egypt 'cause he was running away from King Solomon, found out about it, he came back from Egypt and stuff. 3. So they hit him up and were like, 'Yo, Jeroboam and all of us Israel peeps are here to chat with Rehoboam,' 4. Your dad really made us suffer with all these rules and responsibilities. So, can you like, make things a bit easier for us by lightening the load and taking off some of the pressure put on us? If you do, we promise to be down to serve you, bro. 5. And he was like, yo, come back to me in three days. And the people were like, bet, peace out. 6. So King Rehoboam went and talked to the OGs who had been there since his dad Solomon was alive, and he asked them, 'What advice do you have for me to respond to these people?' 7. And they were like, 'Dude, if you show kindness to these peeps, and make them happy, and speak like, awesome words to them, they'll totally be loyal to you forever.' 8. But he totally ignored the advice of the wise old geezers and sought the opinions of his fellow Gen Z squad, the ones who grew up with him and were chillin' right by his side. 9. He asked them, 'Any ideas on how to respond to these people who told me to lighten the load that my father imposed on us?' 10. And the squad that grew up with him spoke to him like, listen up bro, here's how you need to reply to those people who be complaining about your dad making things tough for us. Just tell 'em that my skills are gonna be way more powerful than my old man's, like my pinky finger is stronger than his whole body. 11. Yo, listen up! My pops may have laid a heavy burden on you, but I'm about to make it even heavier. He disciplined you with whips, but I'm gonna come at you with scorpions. Yeah, you heard that right. Pops really went all out with the workload, ya know. 12. So Jeroboam and all the homies rolled up to Rehoboam on day three, just like the king told them, saying, 'Slide back again to me on day three.' 13. The king totally snapped at them; King Rehoboam straight up ignored the advice of the OGs, 14. And the young guys were like, listen up, my dudes. Your old man totally made your workload a total drag, but I'm gonna make it even worse. He disciplined you with whips, but I'm gonna go next level and bring out the scorpions! 15. The king didn't listen to the people, 'cause God made it happen so that the LORD could make His words come true like Ahijah the Shilonite said to Jeroboam, Nebat's son. 16. And when all of Israel realized that the king wasn't listening to them, the people spoke up and said to the king, 'What do we even gain from being connected to David? We don't have any claim on Jesse's son. Everyone, go back to your own business, Israel! And David, you better focus on your own affairs.' So all of Israel returned to their own lives. 17. So like, the Israelite peeps who were living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam was the boss ruling over them. 18. King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of collecting taxes, but the people of Israel pelted him with rocks until he died. Panicked, King Rehoboam quickly hopped onto his chariot to escape to Jerusalem. 19. And Israel straight up went against the house of David like they're not even vibing with them anymore till this day. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 101. And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel come to make him king. 2. And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who {was} in Egypt, whither he had fled from the presence of Solomon the king, heard {it}, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt. 3. And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spake to Rehoboam, saying, 4. Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee. 5. And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed. 6. And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give ye {me} to return answer to this people? 7. And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be thy servants for ever. 8. But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him. 9. And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us? 10. And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou {it} somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little {finger} shall be thicker than my father's loins. 11. For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I {will chastise you} with scorpions. {my father put: Heb. my father laded} 12. So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third day. 13. And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men, 14. And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I {will chastise you} with scorpions. 15. So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. 16. And when all Israel {saw} that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? and {we have} none inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, O Israel: {and} now, David, see to thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents. 17. But {as for} the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 18. Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that {was} over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to {his} chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. {made speed: Heb. strengthened himself} 19. And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 111. So, like, Rehoboam pulled up to Jerusalem and got a crew of 180k badass homies from the clans of Judah and Benjamin. They were straight-up warriors, ready to wage war against Israel and reclaim the kingdom for Rehoboam, you know? 2. Yo, God spoke to Shemaiah, this dude who's tight with Him and stuff, and here's what He said, 3. Yo, hit up Rehoboam, son of Solomon, king of Judah, and anyone in Judah and Benjamin. Here's what you gotta say:  4. Yo, listen up! The LORD says, 'Yo, chill! Don't go up and start fighting your bros. Just head back home, ya know? I'm the one behind all this. And guess what? They actually listened to the LORD and decided to bounce instead of going against Jeroboam. 5. So Rehoboam stayed in Jerusalem and constructed cities in Judah to enhance their security. 6. He, like, totally constructed these sick places called Bethlehem, Etam, and Tekoa. 7. And like yo, there's Bethzur, Shoco, and Adullam in da mix. 8. And like, Gath, Mareshah, and Ziph, 9. And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 10. And, like, there were also Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which were super fortified cities in the land of Judah and Benjamin. 11. And he like, upgraded the strongholds and appointed captains to run them, stocked up on food, oil, and wine, you know, to keep his crew well supplied. 12. And like, in every city, he was all about the shields and spears, making them super strong and representing Judah and Benjamin, you know? 13. And all the priests and Levites from all over Israel came to him. They showed up from every corner of the land. 14. So, like, the Levites decided to bounce from their hood and their stuff, and headed to Judah and Jerusalem. 'Cause Jeroboam and his sons basically cancelled them from doing their priest duties for the Lord, you know? 15. And he appointed some dudes to be priests for the wicked places, you know, like for those evil spirits and those calf idols he had made. 16. And then, like, people from all the tribes of Israel who were totally committed to seeking the LORD God of Israel went to Jerusalem to give sacrifices to the LORD God of their ancestors. 17. So they like totally boosted the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam, Solomon's kid, super powerful for a whole three years. Like, those three years were all about following in the footsteps of David and Solomon, you know? 18. And Rehoboam was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna marry Mahalath, daughter of Jerimoth, who's a homie from David's fam, and also Abihail, daughter of Eliab, son of Jesse, is gonna be part of the squad too. 19. These are the kids he had: Jeush, Shamariah, and Zaham. 20. Then he started dating Maachah, who was Absalom's daughter. They had kids named Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. BTW, Maachah was also known as Michaiah, Uriel's daughter. 21. And Rehoboam was really into Maachah, Absalom's daughter. She was his favorite out of all his wives and concubines (because, you know, he had a bunch of them!). Rehoboam ended up having a total of eighteen wives, sixty concubines, twenty-eight sons, and sixty daughters! Can you imagine? 22. And Rehoboam promoted Abijah, Maachah's son, as the top leader among his siblings, with intentions of making him king. 23. And he was really smart, and sent all his children to different places in the countries of Judah and Benjamin, to every cool city. And he made sure they had plenty of food. Also, he wanted to have lots of wives. {lots of wives: in Hebrew, a whole bunch of wives} \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 111. And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen {men}, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam. 2. But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 3. Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying, 4. Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam. 5. And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence in Judah. 6. He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa, 7. And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam, 8. And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph, 9. And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah, 10. And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which {are} in Judah and in Benjamin fenced cities. 11. And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them, and store of victual, and of oil and wine. 12. And in every several city {he put} shields and spears, and made them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side. 13. And the priests and the Levites that {were} in all Israel resorted to him out of all their coasts. {resorted...: Heb. presented themselves to him} 14. For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the LORD: 15. And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the devils, and for the calves which he had made. 16. And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers. 17. So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they walked in the way of David and Solomon. 18. And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David to wife, {and} Abihail the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse; 19. Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham. 20. And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith. {Maachah: she is also called Michaiah the daughter of Uriel} 21. And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and threescore daughters.) 22. And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, {to be} ruler among his brethren: for {he thought} to make him king. 23. And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he desired many wives. {many wives: Heb. a multitude of wives} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 121. So, like, once Rehoboam was all settled in as king and everything, he started doing his own thing and totally went against what God wanted. And not just him, but all of Israel followed suit too. 2. So, like, in the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, this dude Shishak, who was the king of Egypt, totally rolled up to Jerusalem, because the people there, like, totally messed up and went against the Lord. 3. He had, like, 1200 chariots and 60,000 horse-riders, plus a huge crowd of people from Egypt. Can you believe it? There were Lubims, Sukkiims, and Ethiopians too! 4. And he totally conquered the super fortified cities that belonged to Judah, and then arrived at Jerusalem. 5. So this prophet named Shemaiah rolled up to Rehoboam and the squad of big shots from Judah, who were all chilling in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he straight up told them, 'Listen up, the LORD has some words for you: You went and ditched me, so now I'm just gonna let Shishak give you a taste of his power.' 6. So basically, the big shots of Israel and the king were like, 'Okay, we messed up, God is totally in the right.' 7. And like, when God saw that they were like, being all humble and stuff, He was like, 'Yo, Shemaiah, listen up! They totally humbled themselves, so I'm not gonna wreck them completely. Instead, I'll let them have, like, some sort of relief from trouble. And like, my anger won't be unleashed on Jerusalem by Shishak, at least not immediately.' 8. But they will be his servants so that they learn about serving me and serving the kingdoms of other nations. 9. So, like, this dude Shishak, the king of Egypt, totally rolled up to Jerusalem, and straight up jacked all the sick treasures from the house of the LORD and the king's crib. He took everything, man! And, yo, he even swiped those epic gold shields that Solomon had made. 10. But instead, King Rehoboam had these really cool brass shields made and gave them to his top guard to protect the entrance of his crib. 11. So, when the king stepped inside the crib of the Almighty, the security squad swooped in, grabbed them, and then escorted them right back to the secure zone. 12. And when he showed humility, God's anger towards him subsided, preventing complete destruction. And in Judah, things were going pretty smoothly. (and despite that, or surprisingly, good things happened in Judah) 13. King Rehoboam leveled up in Jerusalem and took charge. He was 41 years old when he started ruling and reigned for 17 years in Jerusalem, the city that the LORD picked as his favorite out of all the tribes of Israel. It was like a gamer tagging his name on a spot. And his mom, Naamah, was a total Ammonitess. 14. And he messed up, because he didn't even bother to get his heart right and seek the LORD. {prepared: or, fixed} 15. So like, everything that Rehoboam did from the beginning to the end, it's all like written down in the book of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer, you know, documenting all the family trees and stuff. And oh man, Rehoboam and Jeroboam, they were constantly at war with each other. It's all recorded, ya know! 16. And Rehoboam passed away and was laid to rest in the city of David. And his son Abijah took over as ruler. {Abijah: also known as Abijam} \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 121. And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him. 2. And it came to pass, {that} in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD, 3. With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people {were} without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians. 4. And he took the fenced cities which {pertained} to Judah, and came to Jerusalem. 5. Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and {to} the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak. 6. Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD {is} righteous. 7. And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; {therefore} I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak. {some: or, a little while} 8. Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries. 9. So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made. 10. Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed {them} to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house. 11. And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber. 12. And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy {him} altogether: and also in Judah things went well. {and also...: or, and yet in Judah there were good things} 13. So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam {was} one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name {was} Naamah an Ammonitess. 14. And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD. {prepared: or, fixed} 15. Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, {are} they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And {there were} wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. {book: Heb. words} 16. And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead. {Abijah: also called, Abijam} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 131. So, like, in the 18th year of King Jeroboam's rule, Abijah started being in charge of Judah. 2. So this dude ruled the city for like three years, and his Mom, Michaiah, was from this place called Gibeah. And there was like this big feud going on between Abijah and Jeroboam. 3. Abijah gathered up his crew of fearless warriors, a solid force of 400K handpicked soldiers. On the other side, Jeroboam wasn't messing around either, coming at him with a massive squad of 800K elite badasses. Abijah meant business, no doubt. 4. So Abijah goes up to mount Zemaraim, this like, totally awesome place in mount Ephraim, and he's like, 'Listen up, Jeroboam and all you peeps of Israel! Hear what I gotta say!' 5. Don't you already know that the LORD God of Israel totally handed over the kingdom of Israel to David forever? Like, it's a serious deal and it even includes his kids, thanks to a super important agreement. 6. But this dude Jeroboam, who used to work for Solomon, David's son, decided to go against his boss and rebelled. 7. And a bunch of useless dudes, the children of Belial, got together and ganged up on Rehoboam, Solomon's son, when Rehoboam was still young and couldn't handle them. 8. And now you actually believe that you can go against the Lord's kingdom, handled by the sons of David? Seriously? You may have a ton of people with you and those shiny golden calves that Jeroboam whipped up for you to worship, but come on now. 9. Yo, did y'all just straight up reject the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites and instead made yourselves priests like those other nations? So now anyone who wants to be a priest, just gotta bring a young bull and seven rams and boom, they're a priest for some fake gods. 10. But like, for real, the LORD is totally our God, and we haven't ditched Him at all. And the priests, who serve the LORD, they're like the sons of Aaron and the Levites handle all their tasks like total pros: 11. Every morning and evening, they offer burnt sacrifices and sweet incense to the LORD. They also neatly arrange the shewbread on the pure table, and light the golden candlestick with its lamps every evening. We remain faithful in carrying out the duties assigned by the LORD our God, but sadly, you have abandoned Him. 12. Yo, check this out: God's got our back as our leader, and his priests are straight-up blasting trumpets to warn you. Listen up, fam, don't even think about going against the LORD, God of your ancestors. 'Cause I promise you, it won't end well for you. 13. But then Jeroboam set up a sneaky trap from the back: so while Judah was facing them, the trap was lurking behind them. 14. And, like, Judah turned around and saw, like, the battle happening in front of them and behind them too. So they, like, cried out to the LORD, and the priests, like, blasted their trumpets. 15. So, like, the dudes from Judah were like, shouting and stuff, and, like, OMG, God totally wrecked Jeroboam and all of Israel, just straight up owned them in front of Abijah and his crew from Judah. #Gameover 16. So, like, the Israelites ran away from Judah, but God totally let them get beat. 17. And Abijah and his squad totally wrecked them: like, they wiped out five hundred thousand elite soldiers from Israel. 18. So the Israelites got owned back then, but the people from Judah came out on top because they had faith in the LORD God of their ancestors. 19. So Abijah went after Jeroboam and conquered some cities from him, like Bethel and its surrounding towns, Jeshanah and its surrounding towns, and Ephrain along with its surrounding towns. 20. Jeroboam couldn't make a comeback during Abijah's time because the big man upstairs put him down for good. 21. Abijah became super successful and had a total of fourteen wives, and they had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters together. 22. The other stuff Abijah did, and how he rolled, and what he said, is all recorded in the book written by the prophet Iddo. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 131. Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to reign over Judah. 2. He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 3. And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war, {even} four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, {being} mighty men of valour. {Abijah set: Heb. Abijah bound together} 4. And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which {is} in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel; 5. Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the kingdom over Israel to David for ever, {even} to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt? 6. Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord. 7. And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them. 8. And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the hand of the sons of David; and ye {be} a great multitude, and {there are} with you golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for gods. 9. Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of {other} lands? so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, {the same} may be a priest of {them that are} no gods. {to consecrate...: Heb. to fill his hand} 10. But as for us, the LORD {is} our God, and we have not forsaken him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, {are} the sons of Aaron, and the Levites {wait} upon {their} business: 11. And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also {set they in order} upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him. 12. And, behold, God himself {is} with us for {our} captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper. 13. But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambushment {was} behind them. 14. And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle {was} before and behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. 15. Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah. 16. And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God delivered them into their hand. 17. And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men. 18. Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time, and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon the LORD God of their fathers. 19. And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns thereof, and Ephrain with the towns thereof. 20. Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died. 21. But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters. 22. And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, {are} written in the story of the prophet Iddo. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 141. And then Abijah passed away, being laid to rest in the city of David. Asa, his son, took his place as ruler. For the next decade, things were chill and peaceful in the land. 2. And Asa was totally on point and did what was lit and righteous in the eyes of the LORD his God:  3. Because he totally got rid of those altars dedicated to random deities and destroyed all those fancy places they were worshiped at. He straight up demolished their statues and chopped down those groves. (BTW, 'images' means statues, in case you were wondering.) 4. And like, he told Judah to totally seek the LORD God of their ancestors, and, you know, actually follow the rules and stuff. 5. Then he removed all the fancy worship spots and false gods from all the cities in Judah, and everything became calm in the kingdom. {images: or idols} 6. And he like, totally built these awesome fortified cities in Judah, ya know? 'Cause the land was all chill and peaceful, no wars and stuff, 'cause it was a vibe from the LORD. Spreadin' that rest, you feel me? 7. So he was like, yo Judah, let's flex on these cities by building walls, towers, gates, and bars. Like, we gotta secure our land while it's still open, because we've been seeking the LORD our God and He's blessed us with mad peace and protection. And guess what? They actually built everything and straight up thrived. 8. So Asa had this army, right? Like, there were three hundred thousand warriors from Judah, and they were equipped with shields and spears. And then Benjamin brought in two hundred eighty thousand soldiers with shields and bows. Let me tell you, these dudes were fierce and courageous. Total badasses! 9. So this dude named Zerah, who was from Ethiopia, like no joke, rolls up with, get this, a massive army of a million peeps and three hundred chariots, and they straight up pull up to Mareshah. 10. So Asa confronted him, and they planned the showdown in the epic battlefield at Zephathah Valley by Mareshah. 11. So Asa was like, yo God, we really need your help. It doesn't matter if we're few or weak, you can totally come through for us. We're counting on you, our God, to defeat this huge crowd. Don't let any mere mortal beat you. 12. Yo, God totally wrecked the Ethiopians when they came up against Asa and Judah, and those Ethiopians straight up ran away in fear. 13. So Asa and his squad chased after those boys all the way to Gerar. They totally wrecked the Ethiopians, like they couldn't even bounce back. It was a complete annihilation in front of the LORD and his crew, and they scored some major loot. 14. And they totally wrecked all the cities near Gerar, because they were straight-up terrified of the Lord. They raided all the cities and scored mad loot, 'cause there was a ton of awesome stuff for the taking. 15. They totally wrecked the tents where the animals were chillin', and straight up hauled away a bunch of sheep and camels, like way too many. Then they came back to Jerusalem, no biggie. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 141. So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years. 2. And Asa did {that which was} good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God: 3. For he took away the altars of the strange {gods}, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: {images: Heb. statues} 4. And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. 5. Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. {images: Heb. sun images} 6. And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest. 7. Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about {them} walls, and towers, gates, and bars, {while} the land {is} yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought {him}, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. 8. And Asa had an army {of men} that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these {were} mighty men of valour. 9. And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah. 10. Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. 11. And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, {it is} nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou {art} our God; let not man prevail against thee. {man: or, mortal man} 12. So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. 13. And Asa and the people that {were} with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. {destroyed: Heb. broken} 14. And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them. 15. They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 151. And God's vibe hit Azariah, Oded's kid: 2. So, he goes to hang with Asa and drops some truth bombs like, 'Listen up, Asa, and all you peeps from Judah and Benjamin! Here's the deal- if you stick with the LORD, He's got your back. And if you actually go looking for Him, you'll totally find Him. But, if you bail on Him, don't be surprised if He bounces on you.' #loyalty 3. For, like, a really long time, Israel has been totally lost without the real God, and they haven't had a single cool priest to teach them, or any rules to follow. 4. But, like, when they were going through tough times and stuff, they turned to the LORD God of Israel and reached out to Him, and yo, He totally showed up for them. 5. And back in the day, nobody could catch a break whether they were coming or going. It was pure chaos and stress for everyone living in those places. 6. And one nation was getting wrecked by another nation, and cities were getting trashed by other cities, 'cause God was totally messing them up with all sorts of troubles. {wrecked: Hebrew for beaten into pieces} 7. So, like, be strong and don't let your hands turn all weak, okay? 'Cause, guess what? You're totally gonna get rewarded for all your hard work, for real! 8. So Asa, after hearing what Oded the prophet said, felt empowered and got rid of all the disgusting idols from the entire land of Judah and Benjamin, as well as from the cities he had conquered from Mount Ephraim. He also restored the altar of the LORD that stood in front of the LORD's entrance. 9. And he got together all the homies from Judah and Benjamin, and even some outsiders from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, because they knew he was the real deal and the Lord his God had his back. 10. So they all came together in Jerusalem in the third month, during Asa's fifteenth year as king. 11. And they flexed on the LORD with some mad offerings, bringing in a whopping 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep from their sick loot. It was lit, straight up. 12. And they made a pact to fully vibe with the LORD God of their ancestors, giving it their all - heart and soul! 13. Anyone who refuses to seek the LORD God of Israel will face capital punishment, regardless of age, gender, or social status. 14. And they were like, totally swearin' to the LORD, like super loud, with shoutin' and blastin' trumpets, and jammin' on cornets. 15. And all of Judah was stoked about the promise, 'cause they were fully committed and super eager to find Him. And guess what? They found Him, and the LORD totally hooked them up with some chill vibes all around. 16. And, like, Asa the king straight up dethroned Maachah, who was Asa's grandma, all because she went and made this freaky idol in the woods. So Asa went ahead and destroyed that idol, crushing it with his foot and burning it down by the brook Kidron. No room for idols and horror shows in his kingdom, man. 17. But the Instagram-worthy destinations were not abolished in Israel, even though Asa stayed true to his values throughout his life. 18. And he flexed in the house of God with the stuff his pops gave him, and the stuff he flexed with, like mad silver, gold, and dope af items. 19. And there wasn't any more fighting until Asa had been king for thirty-five years. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 151. And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded: 2. And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD {is} with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you. {to meet...: Heb. before Asa} 3. Now for a long season Israel {hath been} without the true God, and without a teaching priest, and without law. 4. But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them. 5. And in those times {there was} no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations {were} upon all the inhabitants of the countries. 6. And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God did vex them with all adversity. {destroyed: Heb. beaten in pieces} 7. Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded. 8. And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that {was} before the porch of the LORD. {abominable...: Heb. abominations} 9. And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the LORD his God {was} with him. 10. So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa. 11. And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil {which} they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep. {the same...: Heb. in that day} 12. And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul; 13. That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman. 14. And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets. 15. And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about. 16. And also {concerning} Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from {being} queen, because she had made an idol in a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped {it}, and burnt {it} at the brook Kidron. {mother: that is, grandmother} {idol: Heb. horror} 17. But the high places were not taken away out of Israel: nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days. 18. And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated, silver, and gold, and vessels. 19. And there was no {more} war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 161. Like, this one time in, like, the 36th year of Asa's rule, Baasha, the king of Israel, totally attacked Judah and built up this city called Ramah, with, like, the purpose of blocking anyone from like, entering or leaving Judah where Asa was the king, you know? 2. So Asa flexed his riches from the stash of the Lord's house and the king's crib, and hit up Benhadad, the boss of Syria, chilling in Damascus, like, yo, I got something to say. 3. Just so you know, there's an agreement between us, just like there was between our dads. Check it out, I've hooked you up with some cash and bling. Now, go ahead and ditch that alliance with Baasha, the king of Israel, so he'll leave me alone. 4. So Benhadad listened to king Asa and sent his army captains to attack the cities of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Abelmaim, and all the storied cities of Naphtali. 5. And it happened, when Baasha heard about it, that he stopped building Ramah and quit his project. 6. So King Asa gathered all the people of Judah and they took the stones from Ramah and the wood that Baasha was using to build. Then they used those materials to construct Geba and Mizpah. 7. So Hanani the visionary went up to Asa, the king of Judah, and was like, 'Bro, you totally messed up. You depended on the king of Syria instead of trusting in the LORD your God, and now the Syrian army slipped away from your grip.' 8. Yo, weren't the Ethiopians and the Lubims, like, a massive crew rolling deep with mad chariots and horsemen? But yo, since you put your trust in the LORD, he straight up handed them over to you. {a huge: like, in abundance, you know} 9. The LORD be keeping a watchful eye all over the earth, flexing His divine strength for those who stay loyal to Him. But you messed up big time, so get ready for some serious conflict from here on out. (And no, it's not just about flexing His strength, it's about being there for you and stuff.) 10. So Asa got really mad at the seer and threw him into a prison cell. He was so furious with him because of what he said. And on top of that, Asa also mistreated some of the people during that time. 11. Yo, check it out. The whole story of Asa, from start to finish, is all documented in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 12. And when Asa had been ruling for 39 years, he got a serious foot disease. It was really bad, but instead of turning to the LORD, he went to the doctors for help. 13. And Asa passed away, joining his ancestors, in the forty-first year of his rule. 14. They put him to rest in his fancy tombs that he built for himself in the city of David, and placed him on a comfy bed filled with lovely scents and various types of aromatic spices crafted by the clever apothecaries. Then they held a grand bonfire in his honor. (had made: In Hebrew, it means had dug) \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 161. In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 2. Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, {Damascus: Heb. Darmesek} 3. {There is} a league between me and thee, as {there was} between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me. 4. And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali. {his: Heb. which were his} 5. And it came to pass, when Baasha heard {it}, that he left off building of Ramah, and let his work cease. 6. Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah. 7. And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand. 8. Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand. {a huge: Heb. in abundance} 9. For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of {them} whose heart {is} perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars. {to shew...: or, strongly to hold with them, etc} 10. Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for {he was} in a rage with him because of this {thing}. And Asa oppressed {some} of the people the same time. {oppressed: Heb. crushed} 11. And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they {are} written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 12. And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease {was} exceeding {great}: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians. 13. And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign. 14. And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds {of spices} prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great burning for him. {had made: Heb. had digged} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 171. And then Jehoshaphat took over as king and made sure to stand strong against Israel. 2. And he, like, stationed a bunch of troops in, like, all the fortified cities of Judah. He, you know, put soldiers in like, the land of Judah, and also in the cities of Ephraim, that his dad Asa had, you know, captured. 3. And God was with Jehoshaphat because he followed in the footsteps of his dad, David, and didn't get caught up with worshipping false gods. 4. Instead, they looked to the {LORD} God of their father, and followed his commandments, not the ways of Israel. 5. So, like, God totally made Jehoshaphat the king and all the people of Judah showered him with gifts and stuff. He was, like, loaded with riches and had, like, mad respect from everyone. #blessed 6. And he was totally on the Lord's vibe, like all in. Plus, he got rid of all those sketchy high places and groves in Judah. 7. And in the third year of his reign, he hit up his squad - Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethaneel, and Michaiah - to spread the knowledge in the cities of Judah. 8. And he also sent some Levites to assist them. Their names were Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah. Among the Levites, there were Elishama and Jehoram, who were priests. 9. So, like, they were teaching in Judah and they had the book of the law of the LORD, right? And they were all, like, going around to all the cities in Judah, spreading the teachings and, like, educating the people. 10. And all the other kingdoms surrounding Judah were mad shook by the LORD, so they didn't even think about starting any war with Jehoshaphat. They were straight up scared, y'all. No cap. 🔥 11. Yo, just so you know, some of the Philistines showed up with some sick gifts for Jehoshaphat. They brought him a bunch of tribute silver. And check it, the Arabians came through with a massive haul of flocks - we're talking seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and another seven thousand and seven hundred he goats. That's straight up impressive. 12. Jehoshaphat was very successful and he flexed hard; he built some sick castles and epic cities in Judah. {castles: or, palaces} 13. And he was hella busy in the cities of Judah: and the homies who were warriors, straight up badass dudes, were posted up in Jerusalem. 14. So, these are the stats of the squad based on their family background: In the crew of Judah, we got Adnah leading the way with three hundred thousand fierce warriors by his side. They're absolutely formidable. 15. And right beside him was Jehohanan, the leader, and he had a solid crew of two hundred and eighty thousand with him. They had his back, no doubt. 16. And then there was Amasiah, son of Zichri, who totally volunteered to serve the LORD. And guess what? He had, like, two hundred thousand seriously strong and brave warriors by his side. 17. And Benjamin had Eliada, who was pretty badass, leading an army of 200k armed dudes with bows and shields. 18. And right beside him was Jehozabad, with a massive army of 180,000 fully geared up for battle. 19. These dudes served the king, along with the ones the king stationed in the fortified cities all over Judah. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 171. And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel. 2. And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. 3. And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim; {of...: or, of his father, and of David} 4. But sought to the {LORD} God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel. 5. Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honour in abundance. {brought: Heb. gave} 6. And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah. {was...: that is, was encouraged} 7. Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, {even} to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah. 8. And with them {he sent} Levites, {even} Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests. 9. And they taught in Judah, and {had} the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people. 10. And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that {were} round about Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat. {fell: Heb. was} 11. Also {some} of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats. 12. And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store. {castles: or, palaces} 13. And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valour, {were} in Jerusalem. 14. And these {are} the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand. 15. And next to him {was} Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand. {next...: Heb. at his hand} 16. And next him {was} Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour. 17. And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand. 18. And next him {was} Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war. 19. These waited on the king, beside {those} whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 181. So, like, Jehoshaphat was totally loaded and respected by everyone, and he totally teamed up with Ahab. 2. So, after some time, he went down to Ahab in Samaria. And Ahab hooked him up with tons of sheep and oxen, not just for him but also for all the homies he brought along. Ahab convinced him to roll with him to Ramothgilead. Yeet! 3. So, like, Ahab, the king of Israel, asked Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, if he wanted to join him in this battle, you know, in Ramothgilead. And Jehoshaphat was all like, 'I got your back, man! Me and my people are with you. Let's do this!' 4. Yo, Jehoshaphat told the king of Israel, 'Yo, can you hit up the LORD today and see what He's gotta say?' 5. So the king of Israel rounded up about 400 prophets and asked them, 'Should we roll up to Ramothgilead for a brawl or should I chill out? And they were all like, 'Go for it! God's got your back, man.' 6. But Jehoshaphat was like, 'Yo, isn't there another prophet of the LORD around here we could ask for guidance? I mean, more options, ya know?' 7. The king of Israel was like, 'There's this one guy we can ask the LORD through, but ugh, I can't stand him! He always brings bad news, never anything good. Yeah, it's Micaiah, son of Imla.' But Jehoshaphat was like, 'Don't say that, King.' 8. So, the king of Israel was like, 'Yo, find that officer dude and hurry up and bring me Micaiah, son of Imla.' 9. So, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, were chilling on their thrones, decked out in their fancy outfits, posted up in this open area by the entrance of the gate in Samaria. And all the prophets were dropping some mad prophecies in front of them. 10. So, Zedekiah, Chenaanah's kid, went ahead and crafted some sick iron horns. And he was like, 'Yo, the LORD says you gonna rock these horns and straight up wreck Syria until they are totally wiped out. Like, you gonna consume them, bro!' 11. And all the prophets were like, 'Yo, go to Ramothgilead and you'll totally crush it, dude. The LORD's got your back and he's gonna hand it over to the king.' 12. So, the guy who was sent to fetch Micaiah approached him and said, 'Listen up, bro, all the prophets are saying really positive stuff to the king. It would be great if you could join in and say the same things. Spread some positivity, you know?' 13. And Micaiah was like, yo, I swear by the LORD's name, whatever info my God gives me, that's exactly what I'm gonna say, no lie. 14. So, like, when he arrived in front of the king, the king was like, 'Hey Micaiah, should we go to Ramothgilead and fight the battle, or should I chill out?' And Micaiah was like, 'Dude, go for it! You'll crush 'em and they'll totally surrender to you.' 15. And the king was like, dude, I've asked you so many times to just be honest with me in the Lord's name. Can you please not keep anything from me? 16. Yo, so he was like, I totally saw all of Israel spread out on the mountains, like clueless sheep without a shepherd. And then the LORD was like, 'These peeps don't have a boss, so let 'em all go back home in peace, yo.' 17. Yo, the king of Israel was like, 'Didn't I tell you that he's not gonna bring me good news, only bad? Like, seriously?'} 18. So, like, listen up guys, God was all like, 'Yo, pay attention and hear what the LORD's gotta say.' And then I saw God chilling on His throne, and the whole crew of angels were standing on His right and left side, you know what I'm saying? 19. So, like, the LORD was like, 'Yo, who's gonna trick Ahab, the king of Israel, into going up to Ramothgilead and end up eating dirt?' And one dude was like, 'I got an idea, hear me out,' and another dude was like, 'Hold up, I got a different plan, check it out.' 20. Suddenly, a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, 'I got this, I'll totally mess with him.' And the LORD replied, 'Okay, how do you plan on doing that?' 21. And he was like, I'm gonna dip and be a total fake spirit, giving bogus prophecies to all his peeps. Then, the LORD was like, you should totally lure him in and you're gonna succeed, so just go ahead and do it. 22. Yo, just listen up. God straight up put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets, and He's not holding back on His judgment against you. 23. So Zedekiah, Chenaanah's kid, walks up and slaps Micaiah on the face. He's all like, 'Hey, how did the Spirit of the LORD end up talking to you instead of me? Like, what's the deal?' 24. Yo, listen up! Micaiah straight up told him, 'Check it, bro, when you go all low-key into that secret hiding spot, you gonna see what's about to go down on that day. Don't even trip, it's gonna be some next level stuff happening there.' 25. And the king of Israel was like, 'Hey, grab Micaiah and take him back to Amon, the ruler of the city, and to Joash, the king's son!' 26. And the king's like, 'Yo, throw this dude in jail, give him some sad, bland bread and water, and keep him there until I come back unharmed.' 27. And Micaiah was like, if you come back in one piece, then the LORD totally spoke through me. And he was like, listen up, everyone. 28. So, like, the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat – the king of Judah, you know – they decided to head up to this place called Ramothgilead. 29. The king of Israel was like, 'Yo, Jehoshaphat, I'm gonna change up my look and go to battle incognito, but you stay in your fancy robes.' So the king of Israel completely transformed his appearance and they both headed to the battle. 30. So the king of Syria told his chariot captains not to fight with anyone except the king of Israel, whether they were weak or strong. 31. And, like, when the dudes in the chariots peeped Jehoshaphat, they were like, 'Yo, it's the king of Israel, fam!' So they started circling him, ready to throw down. But Jehoshaphat straight up shouted out, and the LORD came through and had his back, man! God made those haters bounce and peace out from him. 32. So basically, when the chariot leaders figured out it wasn't the king of Israel they were chasing, they decided to turn around and give up on pursuing him. 33. So this dude randomly shot an arrow and hit the king of Israel right in his weak spot. The king told his chariot driver to turn around and get him out of there because he got messed up. 34. The fight was getting intense that day, but the king of Israel held his ground in his cool chariot against the Syrians until the evening. And when the sun was about to set, he sadly passed away. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 181. Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab. 2. And after {certain} years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that {he had} with him, and persuaded him to go up {with him} to Ramothgilead. {after...: Heb. at the end of years} 3. And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I {am} as thou {art}, and my people as thy people; and {we will be} with thee in the war. 4. And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day. 5. Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver {it} into the king's hand. 6. But Jehoshaphat said, {Is there} not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him? {besides: Heb. yet, or, more} 7. And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, {There is} yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same {is} Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. 8. And the king of Israel called for one {of his} officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla. {officers: or, eunuchs} {Fetch...: Heb. Hasten} 9. And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat either of them on his throne, clothed in {their} robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. {void...: or, floor} 10. And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push Syria until they be consumed. {they...: Heb. thou consume them} 11. And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver {it} into the hand of the king. 12. And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets {declare} good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good. {with...: Heb. with one mouth} 13. And Micaiah said, {As} the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak. 14. And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand. 15. And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD? 16. Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return {therefore} every man to his house in peace. 17. And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee {that} he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil? {but evil: or, but for evil} 18. Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and {on} his left. 19. And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner. 20. Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? 21. And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And {the LORD} said, Thou shalt entice {him}, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do {even} so. 22. Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee. 23. Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee? 24. And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. {into...: or, from chamber to chamber: Heb. a chamber in a chamber} 25. Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 26. And say, Thus saith the king, Put this {fellow} in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace. 27. And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, {then} hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people. 28. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramothgilead. 29. And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went to the battle. 30. Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that {were} with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of Israel. 31. And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It {is} the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them {to depart} from him. 32. For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back again from pursuing him. {from...: Heb. from after him} 33. And a {certain} man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. {at a venture: Heb. in his simplicity} {between...: Heb. between the joints and between the breastplate} {wounded: Heb. made sick} 34. And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed {himself} up in {his} chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 191. And Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went back to his crib in peace in Jerusalem. 2. So Jehu, Hanani's seer son, comes up to Jehoshaphat, the king, and straight up asks him, 'Dude, why are you teaming up with these ungodly folks and showing love to those who hate the LORD? Now you got some serious wrath coming your way from the LORD.' 3. But, like, there's definitely some awesome stuff about you 'cause you've totally gotten rid of those lame groves in the land and you're totally into seeking God with all your heart. 4. So Jehoshaphat stayed in Jerusalem, and he made his way among the people from Beersheba all the way to Mount Ephraim. He led them back to worship the LORD God of their ancestors. 🙏 5. So he appointed judges in all the lit cities of Judah, like, in each city and stuff, 6. Yo, listen up, judges! Pay attention to your actions, 'cause you're not just judging for humans. You're judging in the presence of the Big Man upstairs, the LORD. He's right there with you, overseeing the whole judgment process. #DivineJustice 7. So, like, make sure you have mad respect for the LORD, you know? Pay attention and do what's right, 'cause the LORD our God is totally fair, no exceptions. No favoritism or bribes allowed. 8. So Jehoshaphat chose the Levites, priests, and leaders of Israel to handle the LORD's judgment and settle any disputes in Jerusalem. 9. Yo, listen up! This is what you gotta do if you wanna show respect to the big man upstairs, okay? Make sure you follow these instructions carefully, stay true to your word, and keep your heart in the right place, no joke. 10. If any drama goes down with your peeps in their cities, where there's beef, conflicts with the law, or disagreements on rules and judgments, it's on you to give them a heads up so they don't cross the line with the Big Man upstairs. If you don't, then both you and your crew will be facing some serious consequences. So make sure to handle the situation right and avoid any wrongdoings. 11. Yo, check it out, Amariah, the head priest, is in charge of all things relating to the LORD. Zebadiah, Ishmael's son, is the big shot in charge of the house of Judah and handles all the king's business. Oh, and the Levites will be your right-hand peeps as officers. So, be brave, show some courage, and the LORD will have your back. Take courage and get things done, my friend. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 191. And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem. 2. And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD? therefore {is} wrath upon thee from before the LORD. 3. Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared thine heart to seek God. 4. And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers. {he went...: Heb. he returned and went out} 5. And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city, 6. And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the LORD, who {is} with you in the judgment. {in...: Heb. in the matter of judgment} 7. Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed and do {it}: for {there is} no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor respect of persons, nor taking of gifts. 8. Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and {of} the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem. 9. And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart. 10. And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and {so} wrath come upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not trespass. 11. And, behold, Amariah the chief priest {is} over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites {shall be} officers before you. Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good. {Deal...: Heb. Take courage and do} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 201. After all that, the kids from Moab and Ammon, along with some others besides the Ammonites, rolled up on Jehoshaphat to start a war. 2. Yo, listen up, Jehoshaphat was just informed that a massive crowd from overseas, near Syria, is heading your way. They're posted up in Hazazontamar, by Engedi, man. 3. Jehoshaphat was lowkey scared, so he straight up decided to look for the LORD and told everyone in Judah to skip meals and get spiritually focused. BTW, that 'set himself' means he was seriously determined. 4. So, Judah got their squad together to reach out to the LORD, yo! They all rolled up from every city in Judah, on a mission to find the LORD. 5. Then Jehoshaphat came to the gathering of the peeps of Judah and Jerusalem, in da crib of the LORD, in front of da new hangout spot, 6. And I was like, yo, O LORD God of our fathers, don't you rule the vibes up in heaven? And aren't you the boss over all the kingdoms of the heathens? And, like, you got mad power and mojo in your hands, like, nobody can mess with you, for real. 7. You're totally our God, the one who kicked out all those people living in this place before your squad, the Israelites, moved in and hooked them up with the land that belonged to Abraham, your homie, for all time. Like, no joke, man. 8. So they moved in and built a dope sanctuary for you with your name, like, 9. If some bad things happen to us, like a big problem, a tough decision, a big illness, or a lack of food, and we gather in this place, where you are present, because you are known in this place, and we ask for your help when we're going through hard times, then you will listen and give us a hand. 10. Yo, listen up. Check this out - back in the day, when Israel was cruisin' out of Egypt, there were these dudes, the children of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir. God was like, 'Nah, Israel, you can't roll up on them, don't invade their turf.' So, Israel held back and didn't wreck 'em. 11. Yo, check it out, they really think they're doing us a favor by kicking us out of the land you promised to us as our inheritance. 12. Yo, God, can't you like, totally pass some judgment on them? 'Cause, lowkey, we got no power to deal with this huge crew that's coming at us, and we're hella clueless about what to do. But, like, we're totally relying on you, you know? 13. And like, everyone from Judah, including their little kids, their partners, and their children, were all standing before the LORD. 14. And then, Jahaziel, who is Zechariah's son, Benaiah's grandson, Jeiel's great-grandson, and Mattaniah's great-great-grandson, a Levite from the line of Asaph, felt the powerful presence of the LORD's Spirit in the middle of the crowd. 15. Listen up, everyone in Judah and Jerusalem, including you, King Jehoshaphat! God's got a message for you. Don't be scared or freaked out by this huge army, 'cause this battle ain't on your shoulders - it's on God's. 16. Tomorrow, you gotta head down and confront them. They'll be coming up by that cliff called Ziz. You'll find them at the end of the brook, right before the wilderness of Jeruel. *Note: 'cliff' means 'ascent' and 'brook' means 'valley'. 17. You won't even have to fight in this whole thing, just get ready and stand your ground, and watch as the LORD saves you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Don't be scared or freaked out; tomorrow, go and face them head-on because the LORD will be right there with you. 18. Jehoshaphat totally bowed down, like, face to the ground and all the people of Judah and Jerusalem were totally worshipping the LORD, showing mad respect. 19. So the Levites, from the Kohathite and Korhite families, stood up and praised the LORD God of Israel with a super lit loud voice! 20. Early in the morning, they headed out into the wild Tekoa. And as they were going, Jehoshaphat stood up and said, Listen up, Judah and people of Jerusalem! Put your faith in the LORD your God, and you'll be set for success. Trust in His prophets, and you'll thrive. 21. So, after getting everyone's opinion, he picked some epic singers to praise the LORD and celebrate His pure awesomeness. They led the way for the army and shouted, Praisee the LORD! His mercy is forever!' 22. And when they started vibing and praising, the LORD straight up ambushed the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir who were coming for Judah, and they got wrecked. {And when...: Like, when they, you know, started getting their jam on} {to sing...: Like, they were singing and giving props} {they were...: or, they totally ended up attacking each other} 23. So, the kids from Ammon and Moab were like all, 'Let's go against the people living in mount Seir and totally wipe them out, like annihilate them and stuff.' And once they finished off the people from Seir, everyone started joining in to help destroy each other, you know? Like, it was one big destruction party! 24. And when Judah reached the lookout point in the desert, they saw a ton of bodies on the ground, and none of them were able to escape. 25. When Jehoshaphat and his squad rolled up to collect the loot, they hit the jackpot. There was mad cash and fancy bling, stacked up with the dead bodies. They straight up flexed and took all the goods they could handle. It was too lit to fit in a single day, so they spent a whole three days loading up. That's how insanely epic the haul was. 26. So, like, on the fourth day, they all gathered in the valley of Berachah and, you know, they totally praised the LORD there, like, amazing, right? So people still call that place The valley of Berachah, because, you know, it's all about blessing and stuff. (Berachah means blessing, FYI) 27. And like, all the guys from Judah and Jerusalem, including Jehoshaphat in the lead, went back to Jerusalem with mad joy because the LORD totally made their enemies get wrecked. (forefront means like, the head or the front position or whatever, just sayin') 28. Then they rolled up to Jerusalem, jamming on their psalteries, harps, and trumpets, making their way to the house of the LORD. 29. And all the kingdoms of those countries were shook when they heard that the LORD battled against Israel's enemies. They were mad scared of God, yo! 30. So Jehoshaphat's kingdom was peaceful, because his God granted him serenity on all sides. 31. And Jehoshaphat became the ruler of Judah at the age of 35. He led Jerusalem for a total of 25 years. His mom's name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. 32. And he followed in the footsteps of his father Asa, never straying from the path and always doing what was pleasing to the LORD. 33. But yo, the high places were still around 'cause the people hadn't gotten their hearts ready for the OG God of their ancestors yet. 34. Yo, there's actually more stuff that Jehoshaphat did that you can peep in the book written by Jehu, Hanani's son. You can also find mention of him in the book about the kings of Israel. #majorplayer 35. And then Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, teamed up with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, who was like, seriously doing some messed up stuff: 36. And he teamed up with him to build some sick ships for a journey to Tarshish. They totally nailed it and built those ships in Eziongeber. 37. So, like, Eliezer, Dodavah's son from Mareshah, totally went off on Jehoshaphat. He's all like, 'Dude, you messed up big time by hanging out with Ahaziah. The LORD totally wrecked everything you've done.' And, check it, those ships got totally wrecked too, so they couldn't even sail to Tarshish. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 201. It came to pass after this also, {that} the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them {other} beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. 2. Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side Syria; and, behold, they {be} in Hazazontamar, which {is} Engedi. 3. And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah. {himself: Heb. his face} 4. And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask {help} of the LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the LORD. 5. And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court, 6. And said, O LORD God of our fathers, {art} not thou God in heaven? and rulest {not} thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand {is there not} power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee? 7. {Art} not thou our God, {who} didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend for ever? {who: Heb. thou} 8. And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying, 9. If, {when} evil cometh upon us, {as} the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name {is} in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help. 10. And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not; 11. Behold, {I say, how} they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. 12. O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes {are} upon thee. 13. And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children. 14. Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; 15. And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle {is} not yours, but God's. 16. To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel. {cliff: Heb. ascent} {brook: or, valley} 17. Ye shall not {need} to fight in this {battle}: set yourselves, stand ye {still}, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD {will be} with you. 18. And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with {his} face to the ground: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD. 19. And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of Israel with a loud voice on high. 20. And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. 21. And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy {endureth} for ever. {that...: Heb. praisers} 22. And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten. {And when...: Heb. And in the time that they, etc} {to sing...: Heb. in singing and praise} {they were...: or, they smote one another} 23. For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy {them}: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another. {to destroy: Heb. for the destruction} 24. And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they {were} dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped. {none...: Heb. there was not an escaping} 25. And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. 26. And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day. {Berachah: that is, blessing} 27. Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies. {forefront: Heb. head} 28. And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD. 29. And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of {those} countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of Israel. 30. So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about. 31. And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: {he was} thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 32. And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not from it, doing {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD. 33. Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers. 34. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they {are} written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who {is} mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel. {book of Jehu: Heb. words, etc} {is mentioned: Heb. was made to ascend} 35. And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly: 36. And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongeber. 37. Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 211. Then Jehoshaphat passed away and was laid to rest in the city of David alongside his ancestors. And his son Jehoram ascended to the throne after him. 2. And Jehoshaphat, the OG, had some lit brothers: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. Straight up, all of them were the sons of Jehoshaphat, the king of Israel. 3. And their dad hooked them up with major stacks of cash, bling, and lit stuff, like legit strong cities in Judah. But the kingdom he passed on to Jehoram, 'cause he was the OG firstborn. 4. So, Jehoram took over his father's kingdom and he made sure to show his strength by brutally killing all his brothers and even some influential people from Israel. 5. Jehoram was 32 when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for 8 years. 6. And he was totally copying the kings of Israel, just like the fam of Ahab: 'cause he married Ahab's daughter, and he did some seriously messed up stuff, not gonna lie, it didn't impress the LORD. 7. But yo, the LORD wasn't gonna wreck the crib of David, 'cause of the deal He made with him, you know? He promised to give him and his fam a lit future, like a forever flame. 🔥 8. During his time, the Edomites straight up decided they were done being ruled by Judah and went ahead and crowned their own king. Flexin' on their independence, ya know? (By the way, dominion in Hebrew means having control or power, just so you're in the loop.) 9. So Jehoram and his squad, riding in their dope chariots, rolled out and pulled an all-nighter. They straight up wrecked the Edomites who were hella surrounding them, including those chariot leaders. 10. So, like, the Edomites totally rebelled against Judah and, like, it's been going on till today. And, oh yeah, Libnah also revolted because, like, he totally abandoned the LORD God of his ancestors. 11. He, like, built these super trendy hangout spots on the mountains in Judah, and got the peeps from Jerusalem to do some shady stuff, you know, getting involved in all kinds of inappropriate relationships. And he totally pressured the people of Judah into going along with it. 12. So Elijah the prophet sent him a message, and it went like this: 'Yo, the word of the LORD God of David, your pops, is this: 'You tripped up, my dude. You haven't been following in the footsteps of Jehoshaphat or Asa, the kings of Judah.' 13. But you, like, totally followed the same messed up path as the kings of Israel. You made Judah and the people of Jerusalem go off the rails, engaging in some seriously questionable behavior, just like the scandalous stuff that went down in the Ahab household. And not only that, you went ahead and straight up killed your own brothers who were actually better than you. Like, seriously? 14. Yo, check it out! The Lord is gonna hit you and your whole crew with a massive plague. It's gonna affect your people, your kids, your wives, and all your stuff. #EpicSmite 15. And you'll get seriously sick with a gnarly gut disease, until your insides start falling out because of the sickness, like, every single day. 16. And God totally sparked some major drama for Jehoram by getting the Philistines and the Arabians, who were chilling near the Ethiopians, all riled up against him: 17. So these guys rolled up to Judah, broke in, and straight up took everything they found in the king's crib - like, all his valuables, his sons, and even his wives. Talk about a total wipeout. The only son they left behind was Jehoahaz, the youngest of the crew. You might also know him as Ahaziah or Azariah, just FYI. 18. And then, like, God totally hit him with this like, super serious illness in his digestive system that, like, couldn't be cured or anything. 19. So like, after a couple of years, this dude got really sick and, no joke, his guts totally fell out. It was gnarly. And to make matters worse, he ended up kicking the bucket from some serious illnesses. And get this, his peeps didn't even give him a proper funeral pyre like his ancestors had. Super disrespectful, right? 20. He was 32 years old when he started ruling, and he ruled in Jerusalem for 8 years, but sadly, no one really cared about him. They did bury him in the city of David, but not with the other kings in the fancy tombs. {without...: meaning nobody really wanted him there} \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 211. Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead. 2. And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these {were} the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel. 3. And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he {was} the firstborn. 4. Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and {divers} also of the princes of Israel. 5. Jehoram {was} thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. 6. And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought {that which was} evil in the eyes of the LORD. 7. Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever. {light: Heb. lamp, or, candle} 8. In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king. {dominion: Heb. hand} 9. Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots. 10. So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time {also} did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers. 11. Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah {thereto}. 12. And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah, 13. But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, {which were} better than thyself: 14. Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods: {a great...: Heb. a great stroke} 15. And thou {shalt have} great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day. 16. Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that {were} near the Ethiopians: 17. And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons. {carried...: Heb. carried captive} {Jehoahaz: also called, Ahaziah, or, Azariah} 18. And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease. 19. And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers. 20. Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings. {without...: Heb. without desire} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 221. So, the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, the youngest son of Jehoram king of Judah, their new king because the Arabians who came to attack their camp had killed all the older sons. And thus, Ahaziah began his reign as the ruler. 2. Ahaziah was 42 years old when he became king. He ruled over Jerusalem for one year. His mom's name was Athaliah and she was Omri's daughter. 3. He was influenced by Ahab's crew, because his mom was his partner in crime. 4. So basically, he was a total disaster in God's eyes, just like the Ahab crew. They were his advisors and led him to his downfall after his dad kicked the bucket. 5. He totally did what they suggested and joined Jehoram, the son of Ahab, who was the king of Israel, in waging war against Hazael, the king of Syria at Ramothgilead. And guess what? The Syrians totally defeated Joram. 6. So, this guy went back to Jezreel to get healed from the injuries he got in a fight with Hazael, the king of Syria. And Azariah, the son of Jehoram, the king of Judah, went down to Jezreel to visit Jehoram, son of Ahab, because he wasn't feeling well. (Just a little FYI, Azariah is also known as Ahaziah or Jehoahaz, in case you were wondering.) 7. So Ahaziah met his downfall because of God's plan. He joined forces with Joram to confront Jehu, the chosen one anointed by the LORD to dismantle the Ahab dynasty. 8. So, like, Jehu was totally carrying out some serious judgment on the house of Ahab. And, while he was doing that, he came across these VIPs from Judah and the cousins of Ahaziah who had been serving him, and he straight up took them out. 9. And they tried to find Ahaziah, and finally caught him hiding in Samaria. They brought him to Jehu, who killed him and buried him. They said, 'He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who truly worshipped the LORD with all his heart.' After his death, the house of Ahaziah lost its power and couldn't retain the kingdom. 10. But like, when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was like, totally dead, she like, rose up and, destroyed all the royal fam of the house of Judah. 11. But Jehoshabeath, who was the king's daughter, saved Joash, Ahaziah's son, by sneaking him out from the others who were killed, and hid him and his nurse in a secret room. You see, Jehoshabeath was the daughter of King Jehoram and the wife of Jehoiada the priest, and she was also Ahaziah's sister. She made sure Athaliah couldn't find Joash and harm him. 12. And he totally went undercover with them in the house of God for like six years straight, while Athaliah was, like, totally ruling the whole land. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 221. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned. 2. Forty and two years old {was} Ahaziah when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Athaliah the daughter of Omri. 3. He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly. 4. Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction. 5. He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram. 6. And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was sick. {which...: Heb. wherewith they wounded him} {Azariah: also called, Ahaziah, or, Jehoahaz} 7. And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram: for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab. {destruction: Heb. treading down} 8. And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them. 9. And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain him, they buried him: Because, said they, he {is} the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom. 10. But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of Judah. 11. But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not. {Jehoshabeath: also called, Jehosheba} 12. And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 231. So, in the seventh year, Jehoiada decided to level up and gathered the squad: Azariah, son of Jeroham, Ishmael, son of Jehohanan, Azariah (again), son of Obed, Maaseiah, son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat, son of Zichri, and they became bros forever. 2. So they traveled throughout Judah, gathering up all the Levites from every city in Judah, as well as the respected elders of Israel, and together they arrived in Jerusalem. 3. And like, the whole group of peeps in the church made a deal with the king in the house of God. And he was like, yo, check it, the king's son gonna rule, just like the LORD said about David's descendants. 4. Here's what you gotta do: On the Sabbath, a third of you cool peeps, including priests and Levites, should take turns being doorkeepers. Yeah, like guarding the doors, you know? The Hebrew word for 'doors' actually means 'thresholds', by the way. 5. And like, one-third will hang at the king's crib, one-third will chill at the foundation gate, and everyone else will be vibin' in the courts of the Lord's crib. 6. Only the priests and Levites who serve in the house of the LORD are allowed to enter; they are the chosen ones. The rest of the people must remain vigilant and honor the watch of the LORD. 7. The Levites gonna surround the king, each of them armed and ready. Anyone else who enters the house gonna get killed, just FYI. But y'all gotta stick with the king when he comes in and leaves, you feel me? 8. So, like, the Levites and everyone in Judah totally followed all the instructions from Jehoiada the priest. They made sure to bring in the people who were supposed to work on the Sabbath and let those who were supposed to take a break do their thing. 'Cause Jehoiada the priest didn't mess around and didn't cancel any shifts. 9. Also, Jehoiada the priest gave the army leaders some sick weapons like spears, bucklers, and shields that belonged to king David and were kept in God's crib 😎 10. And he gathered all the peeps, each person flexing with their weapon in hand, from one end of the temple to the other, all around the altar and crib, right by the king. {side: like shoulder, you know} {temple: like house, but fancy} 11. So they brought out the king's son and placed the crown on him, and handed him the official documents, declaring him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and exclaimed, 'Long live the king!' 12. So like, when Athaliah heard all the commotion and hype from the people cheering for the king, she rolled up to the crowd at the crib of the LORD: 13. And she looked, and, OMG, the king was standing at his fancy entrance with the important people and the trumpets next to him. And all the peeps in the land were super stoked and started playing the trumpets, and there were singers rocking out with their musical instruments, giving praises. Then Athaliah freaked out and tore her clothes, yelling, 'Conspiracy, Conspiracy!' 14. So, like, Jehoiada, the priest, got all the hundreds captains that were in charge of the army together and was like, 'Yo, dudes! Take her out of here and if anyone tries to chase after her, kill 'em with swords, man! The priest said not to take her out in the house of the LORD, tho. 15. So they grabbed her; and when she arrived at the entrance of the horse gate by the king's house, they killed her right there. 16. And Jehoiada, like, made this super legit agreement between him, all the peeps, and the king, yo. They were all gonna be the LORD'S squad, no doubt. 17. So, like, everyone just stormed into Baal's crib and straight-up wrecked it. They smashed his altars and destroyed his statues, and they even took out Mattan, the priest of Baal, right there in front of those altars. 18. Jehoiada also assigned the responsibility of running the house of the LORD to the priests, who were from the tribe of Levi. This was something David had planned out when he set up the house of the LORD. Their main job was to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, just as it was written in the law of Moses. And they did it with so much joy and singing, exactly how David had instructed. 19. And he put the cool bouncers at the entrances of the house of the LORD, making sure no one dirty could come in. 20. Then he gathered the top squad leaders, the VIPs, and the influencer bosses, along with all the cool people in the land. They took the king out from the holy crib and escorted him through the fancy entrance to his banging pad. Finally, they hooked the king up on the throne, ruling the kingdom like a boss. 21. And everyone was stoked about it: the city was finally chill after they straight up defeated Athaliah with a sword. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 231. And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, into covenant with him. 2. And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem. 3. And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David. 4. This {is} the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites, {shall be} porters of the doors; {doors: Heb. thresholds} 5. And a third part {shall be} at the king's house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people {shall be} in the courts of the house of the LORD. 6. But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go in, for they {are} holy: but all the people shall keep the watch of the LORD. 7. And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever {else} cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out. 8. So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go {out} on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses. 9. Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that {had been} king David's, which {were} in the house of God. 10. And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king round about. {side: Heb. shoulder} {temple: Heb. house} 11. Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the crown, and {gave him} the testimony, and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king. {God...: Heb. Let the king live} 12. Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the LORD: 13. And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king: and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, Treason. {Treason: Heb. Conspiracy} 14. Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD. 15. So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her there. 16. And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD'S people. 17. Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. 18. Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as {it is} written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, {as it was ordained} by David. {as it was...: Heb. by the hands of David} 19. And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD, that none {which was} unclean in any thing should enter in. 20. And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom. 21. And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 241. Joash was only 7 years old when he started ruling the kingdom, and he ruled the city of Jerusalem for a solid 40 years. By the way, his mom's name was Zibiah and she came from Beersheba. 2. And Joash was totally on point, like he knew what's up with the LORD, throughout Jehoiada the priest's entire gig. 3. So Jehoiada decided to have two wives, and he ended up having sons and daughters with them. 4. So, like, after this, Joash was totally like, yo, let's fix up the Lord's crib, you know, to make it all fresh again. #renovationtime #blessed 5. So, he called all the priests and Levites and told them, 'Head out to the towns in Judah and get money from all the Israelites to fix up the house of your God every year, and make sure you do it quickly.' But the Levites didn't do it quickly. 6. The king hit up Jehoiada, the big boss, and asked him why he hasn't told the Levites to bring in the cash from Judah and Jerusalem like Moses and the crew of Israel commanded. It's for the Tabernacle, yo! 7. So, like, those Athaliah's kids, you know, that totally wicked woman, they totally wrecked God's crib and gave away all the sacred stuff in the LORD's house to those Baalim dudes. 8. So the king told them to make a chest and put it outside the gate of the house of the LORD. 9. So they sent out a message to everyone in Judah and Jerusalem, telling them to bring the offering that Moses, God's loyal servant, commanded the people of Israel to give while they were in the wilderness. The message was loud and clear! 10. And like, everyone, including the cool leaders and all the peeps, were totally stoked and brought in their contributions, throwing them into the chest until they were done, ya feel me? 11. So, like, when they brought the chest to the king's office and saw that there was a lot of money, the scribe of the king and the officer of the high priest came and emptied the chest. Then they took it and put it back in its place. They did this every day and gathered a ton of money. 12. So, the king and Jehoiada hooked up the people who were grinding at the house of the LORD with some cash, and they hired skilled workers like masons and carpenters to fix up the crib. They even found peeps who could handle iron and brass to repair the house of the LORD. 13. So the workers got to work and did a great job, making sure everything in the house of God was on point and strong. They really showed out and made it perfect, no doubt. God's place is lit now, thanks to their skills and dedication! 14. And after they were done, they brought the remaining money to the king and Jehoiada, who used it to make cool stuff for the house of the LORD, like sacred utensils and equipment for offerings, and even fancy spoons made of gold and silver. They kept offering burnt sacrifices in the house of the LORD non-stop throughout Jehoiada's time. (or, pestils) 15. But Jehoiada got super old, like, lived a really long time and then he passed away. He was legit a hundred and thirty years old when he died. 16. And they laid him to rest in the city of David where the kings rest, cuz he was a real one in Israel and showed love to God and his fam. 17. So after Jehoiada died, the big shots from Judah came to pay respects to the king. And guess what? The king actually listened to what they had to say. 18. So, they actually ditched the LORD God of their ancestors and started worshipping trees and statues like it was cool. And surprise, surprise, Judah and Jerusalem got seriously messed up because of their messed up actions. 19. But he like totally sent prophets to them, you know, to bring them back to the LORD. And these prophets were like speaking truth and all, but they were totally ignored. 20. And then Zechariah, Jehoiada's son who was a priest, felt the Spirit of God settle upon him as he stood among the people. He spoke to them, saying, 'Listen up, everyone! God has a message for you. You've been breaking the LORD's commandments, and that's why you're not doing so well. It's because you've turned your back on the LORD, and as a result, He's turned His back on you too.' 21. And, like, they totally teamed up against him, and, like, threw a bunch of rocks at him because the king said so, right in the court of the house of the LORD. 22. So, like, King Joash totally forgot about all the good things that his father Jehoiada did for him and actually ended up killing his own son. And right before he died, he was like, 'Yo, God, you better take notice of this and make things right.' 23. So, like, after a whole year, the army of Syria totally attacked this dude. They rolled up to Judah and Jerusalem and straight-up wrecked all the big shots of the land, taking all their stuff and sending it to the king of Damascus. You know, Damascus, that place. 24. Yo, the Syrians rolled up with a few homies, but then the big man upstairs handed them a massive L. The reason? These dudes straight up ditched the OG LORD God of their ancestors. As a result, they straight up served some justice to Joash. 25. After they abandoned him, because he was seriously ill, his own servants plotted against him to avenge the sons of Jehoiada the priest. They killed him while he was in bed, and he died. They buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs reserved for the kings. 26. And these are the people who plotted against him: Zabad, the son of Shimeath, who was an Ammonite, and Jehozabad, the son of Shimrith, who was a Moabite. (Zabad could also be called Jozacher, and Shimrith could also be called Shomer.) 27. So, like, there's this whole thing about this guy's sons and how they were, like, really burdened with a bunch of responsibilities and stuff. And they totally wrote all about it in this book called the book of the kings. Then this guy named Amaziah took over as king after his dad. He was like, into fixing and rebuilding the house of God. It's all in there, you know? \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 241. Joash {was} seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Zibiah of Beersheba. 2. And Joash did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest. 3. And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters. 4. And it came to pass after this, {that} Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD. {to repair: Heb. to renew} 5. And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened {it} not. 6. And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, {according to the commandment} of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness? 7. For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim. 8. And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD. 9. And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection {that} Moses the servant of God {laid} upon Israel in the wilderness. {a proclamation: Heb. a voice} 10. And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end. 11. Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that {there was} much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance. 12. And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD. 13. So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it. {the work...: Heb. the healing went up upon the work} 14. And when they had finished {it}, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, {even} vessels to minister, and to offer {withal}, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada. {to offer...: or, pestils} 15. But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old {was he} when he died. 16. And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house. 17. Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them. 18. And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass. 19. Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear. 20. And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you. {came...: Heb. clothed} 21. And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD. 22. Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon {it}, and require {it}. 23. And it came to pass at the end of the year, {that} the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus. {at the...: Heb. in the revolution of the year} {Damascus: Heb. Darmesek} 24. For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash. 25. And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings. 26. And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess. {Zabad: or, Jozacher} {Shimrith: or, Shomer} 27. Now {concerning} his sons, and the greatness of the burdens {laid} upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they {are} written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead. {repairing: Heb. founding} {story: or, commentary} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 251. Amaziah was like 25 when he became king, and he ruled for about 29 years in Jerusalem. By the way, his mom's name was Jehoaddan and she was from Jerusalem too. 2. He was like, totally doing the right thing in God's eyes, but he had, like, not a completely pure heart, you know? 3. So, after he became king and everything was official, he decided to take out the people who had offed his dad. True story, fam. #KingdomVibes 4. But he didn't kill their children, he followed what it says in the law, written in the book of Moses. The LORD commanded, saying, Parents shouldn't be punished for their children, and children shouldn't be punished for their parents. Everyone should take responsibility for their own mistakes and face the consequences. 5. So Amaziah brought all the people of Judah together and appointed leaders over thousands and hundreds, following their family lines in the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. He counted all those who were at least twenty years old and discovered that there were three hundred thousand skilled warriors who were ready for battle, skilled in handling spears and shields. 6. He also hired a hundred thousand absolute legends from Israel for a hundred talents of silver. 7. Yo, listen up! This holy dude rolled up to the king and straight up said, Kingg, don't take the Israelite army with you, cuz the LORD's not rocking with them, especially the Ephraim crew.' 8. But if you're gonna go, then do it. Get yourself ready for battle, 'cause God's gonna make you fall in front of the enemy. He's got the power to help or bring you down. 9. And Amaziah was like, dude, what are we gonna do about the hundred talents I gave to the army of Israel? And the man of God was like, bro, the LORD can totally hook you up with way more than that. {army: Hebrew word for band} 10. So Amaziah split with the troops from Ephraim who had come to him, telling them to bounce back and head home. This made them super pissed off at Judah, and they stormed back home with a burning rage. #TemperIssues 11. So Amaziah, like, totally powered up and assembled his crew, then they headed out to this place called the valley of salt and totally whooped the children of Seir, like, ten thousand of them got dealt with. Gnarly! 12. So, the kids from Judah took about ten thousand others as prisoners and brought them to the top of the rock. And dang, they straight up yeeted them off the top, and they all got totally wrecked and shattered. 13. But the soldiers that Amaziah didn't want to fight with him turned around and attacked several cities in Judah, from Samaria all the way to Bethhoron. They defeated three thousand people and took a lot of loot. 14. So, like, once Amaziah was done fighting the Edomites and all, he straight-up started worshiping their gods! He was all about the gods of the children of Seir, setting them up as his own. He even got down on his knees and burned some incense for them, man! 15. So, like, the LORD got super mad at Amaziah, and he sent a prophet to him and was like, 'Dude, seriously? Why are you worshiping these useless gods that couldn't even save their own people from you?' 16. And like, as they were, like, talking, the king was like, yo, dude, are you, like, part of the king's squad? Chill, man, why would you wanna get wrecked? So the prophet, like, held back and was like, I know for sure that God is planning to wreck you, 'cause you've, like, totally messed up and didn't listen to my advice. Like, for real, man. 17. So Amaziah, the king of Judah, decided to chat with Joash, the son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu, the king of Israel. He was like, 'Hey, Joash! Let's meet up and have a face-to-face convo!' 18. So, like, Joash, the king of Israel, hit up Amaziah, the king of Judah, and was like, 'Yo, that little weed in Lebanon slid into the DMs of those tall trees in Lebanon and was like, 'Hey, let's do a little royal merger by marrying your daughter to my son.' But then, outta nowhere, a savage beast from the field showed up and straight-up wrecked the weed.' 19. So you're like, 'Oh look, I totally crushed the Edomites!' and you're feeling all proud and stuff. But seriously, just stay at home. Why would you want to mess with something that's only gonna hurt you and end up making you, and even Judah, fall? 20. But Amaziah was, like, totally stubborn and didn't wanna listen; 'cause it was hella planned by God to let their enemies kick their butts, all 'cause they were obsessed with those Edom gods. 21. So Joash, the king of Israel, went up and came face-to-face with Amaziah, the king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which is part of Judah. 22. And Judah got wrecked by Israel, and they all ran away to their tents. 23. So, Joash, the king of Israel, captured Amaziah, the king of Judah, who happens to be Joash's son and the grandson of Jehoahaz, in Bethshemesh. Then he brought Amaziah to Jerusalem and tore down a part of the city wall, from the Ephraim Gate to the corner gate, which measured about four hundred cubits. (Just to clarify, the corner gate refers to the gate that faces that direction, you know?) 24. So like, he grabbed all the gold, silver, and stuff from the house of God that belonged to Obededom. He even took the treasures from the king's house, the hostages and all. Then he went back to Samaria, you know? 25. So, after Jehoash, the son of Joash, who was the ruler of Judah, passed away, Amaziah carried on as the king for a good fifteen years. Just FYI! 26. Yo, if you wanna know more about what Amaziah did, check out the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. It's got all the deets, from start to finish. 27. So, like, after Amaziah decided to ditch following the LORD, a bunch of people in Jerusalem got all sneaky and made a conspiracy against him. So, he freaked out and escaped to Lachish, but those tricky dudes sent people after him and ended up killing him there. 28. So they took him on horses and laid him to rest with his ancestors in the city of Judah. (FYI: That's the same city where David used to live!) \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 251. Amaziah {was} twenty and five years old {when} he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Jehoaddan of Jerusalem. 2. And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, but not with a perfect heart. 3. Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him, that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father. {established...: Heb. confirmed upon him} 4. But he slew not their children, but {did} as {it is} written in the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall die for his own sin. 5. Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of {their} fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them three hundred thousand choice {men, able} to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield. 6. He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for an hundred talents of silver. 7. But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD {is} not with Israel, {to wit, with} all the children of Ephraim. 8. But if thou wilt go, do {it}, be strong for the battle: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to help, and to cast down. 9. And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee much more than this. {army: Heb. band} 10. Then Amaziah separated them, {to wit}, the army that was come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger. {home again: Heb. to their place} {in great...: Heb. in heat of anger} 11. And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir ten thousand. 12. And {other} ten thousand {left} alive did the children of Judah carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all were broken in pieces. 13. But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them, and took much spoil. {the soldiers...: Heb. the sons of the band} 14. Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them up {to be} his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense unto them. 15. Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand? 16. And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that {the king} said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel. {determined: Heb. counselled} 17. Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another in the face. 18. And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that {was} in Lebanon sent to the cedar that {was} in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that {was} in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle. {thistle: or, furze bush, or, thorn} {a wild...: Heb. a beast of the field} 19. Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to {thine} hurt, that thou shouldest fall, {even} thou, and Judah with thee? 20. But Amaziah would not hear; for it {came} of God, that he might deliver them into the hand {of their enemies}, because they sought after the gods of Edom. 21. So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another in the face, {both} he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which {belongeth} to Judah. 22. And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled every man to his tent. {put...: Heb. smitten} 23. And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits. {the corner...: Heb. the gate of it that looketh} 24. And {he took} all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria. 25. And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years. 26. Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold, {are} they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel? 27. Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and slew him there. {from...: Heb. from after} {made...: Heb. conspired a conspiracy} 28. And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah. {Judah: that is, the city of David} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 261. So like, all the peeps in Judah were like, 'Yo, Uzziah, you're sixteen now, time to be king in place of your dad Amaziah.' (P.S. Uzziah was also called Azariah, just FYI.) 2. He built Eloth and gave it back to Judah after the king passed away. 3. Uzziah became king when he was just sixteen, and he ruled over Jerusalem for a cool fifty-two years. His mom, Jecoliah, was also from Jerusalem. 4. And he totally did what was right in God's eyes, just like his dad Amaziah. 5. And he was all about finding God during the time of Zechariah, who totally got what it meant to see the big picture: and as long as he kept up with seeking the LORD, God totally hooked him up with success. 6. So he went out and fought against the Philistines, smashing the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. Then he built cities near Ashdod and among the Philistines. (Or you could say, in the land of Ashdod) 7. And God totally had his back when it came to dealing with the Philistines, and even those Arabians who were chilling in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims too. #TeamGod 8. The Ammonites straight up flexed on Uzziah with some sick presents. Like, his rep was so lit that people all the way from Egypt were talking about him, ‘cause he got mad strong. No cap. 9. Uzziah went ahead and flexed in Jerusalem by building these sick towers at the corner gate, the valley gate, and at the turning point of the wall, making them super strong. Like, he really repaired and upgraded them, you know? 10. Yo, this dude went all out. He straight up built towers and dug a ton of wells in the desert, because he had mad livestock. Like, he had animals everywhere - in the lowlands, in the plains, even up in the mountains and Carmel. You know why? 'Cause this guy was all about that farming life. He totally loved taking care of the land. 11. And Uzziah had a bunch of warriors who went out to war in organized groups, each with their own count written down by Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler. They were under the command of Hananiah, one of the king's top captains. 12. Bro, there were a total of 2.6K epic dads who were absolute units and super brave. 13. And they had, like, a huge army, bro! There were like, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred warriors, totally ready to bring the heat in battle and back up the king against the enemy. It was, like, the ultimate power move, you know? #squadgoals 14. So Uzziah made sure that everyone in his army had cool stuff like shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and slings to shoot stones with. Yeah, those sling things. Pretty epic, right? 15. And in Jerusalem, they built machines created by skilled inventors, placed on the towers and fortifications, to shoot arrows and large stones. And their fame spread widely because they were greatly assisted until they became powerful. 16. But when he got powerful, he let it get to his head and ended up messing himself up big time. He went against the LORD his God and went into the temple to burn incense on the fancy incense altar. 17. Then Azariah, the priest, went in with him, accompanied by eighty devoted priests of the LORD, who were absolute legends: 18. Yo, Uzziah, you can't be burning incense to the LORD, that's the job of the priests who are directly descended from Aaron and authorized to do it. Leave the sanctuary now, you've crossed the line. This won't earn you any brownie points with the LORD God. 19. So Uzziah gets really angry and starts waving around a censer to burn some incense. But as he's losing his cool with the priests, boom, he suddenly gets a nasty case of leprosy right on his forehead, right there in front of those priests in the House of the LORD, near the fancy incense altar. 20. Then Azariah, the head priest, and all the other priests saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they kicked him out of there. He quickly left on his own too, because God had punished him. 21. Uzziah, the king, had leprosy until the day he died, and he lived in a separate house because he was banned from the Lord's house. Meanwhile, his son Jotham took charge of the royal household and governed the people of the land. 22. So, like, all the other stuff Uzziah did, beginning to end, was written down by Isaiah the prophet, who's like the son of Amoz. 23. Uzziah passed away and was laid to rest alongside his ancestors in the royal burial grounds, because he was diagnosed with leprosy. So, his son Jotham took over as the new ruler. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 261. Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who {was} sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father Amaziah. {Uzziah: or, Azariah} 2. He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers. 3. Sixteen years old {was} Uzziah when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Jecoliah of Jerusalem. 4. And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah did. 5. And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD, God made him to prosper. {in the visions...: Heb. in the seeing of God} 6. And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines. {about...: or, in the country of Ashdod} 7. And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims. 8. And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread abroad {even} to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened {himself} exceedingly. {spread...: Heb. went} 9. Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning {of the wall}, and fortified them. {fortified: or, repaired} 10. Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains: husbandmen {also}, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry. {digged...: or, cut out many cisterns} {Carmel: or, fruitful fields} {husbandry: Heb. ground} 11. Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, {one} of the king's captains. 12. The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour {were} two thousand and six hundred. 13. And under their hand {was} an army, three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy. {an army: Heb. the power of an army} 14. And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields, and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings {to cast} stones. {slings...: Heb. stones of slings} 15. And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped, till he was strong. {spread: Heb. went forth} 16. But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to {his} destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense. 17. And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the LORD, {that were} valiant men: 18. And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, {It appertaineth} not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither {shall it be} for thine honour from the LORD God. 19. Then Uzziah was wroth, and {had} a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar. 20. And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he {was} leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him. 21. And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house, {being} a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son {was} over the king's house, judging the people of the land. {several: Heb. free} 22. Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, write. 23. So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which {belonged} to the kings; for they said, He {is} a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 271. Jotham was like 25 when he started ruling, and he ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. His mom's name was Jerushah, and his grandpa was Zadok. 2. He did the right stuff, just like his dad Uzziah, and stayed away from the LORD's temple. But the people were still being shady. 3. He flexed on that house of the LORD by building a super dope gate, and he went all out by building a ton of stuff on the wall of Ophel. (Ophel: also known as the tower, FYI) 4. And he, like, totally constructed some sick cities up in the mountains of Judah, you know? And, like, in the forests, he built these awesome castles and towers. It was all super impressive, dude. 5. He totally clashed with the king of the Ammonites and totally schooled them. And the Ammonites were so shook that they handed over a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand measures of barley in that same year. And they kept paying up every year, for three solid years. (By the way, this is straight from the original Hebrew!) 6. Jotham totally blew up on the scene, you know? He was so legit because he had his life totally on point and in line with the LORD his God. Like, he had his priorities straight and was all about that solid foundation, you feel me? #established 7. So basically, all the other stuff that Jotham did - you know, his battles, his whole vibe - it's all written down in this book about the kings of Israel and Judah. 8. He was 25 years old when he started ruling, and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. 9. And Jotham passed away, and they laid him to rest in the city of David. Then Ahaz, his son, took over as the new ruler. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 271. Jotham {was} twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also {was} Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok. 2. And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did yet corruptly. 3. He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much. {Ophel: or, the tower} 4. Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers. 5. He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third. {So...: Heb. This} 6. So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before the LORD his God. {prepared: or, established} 7. Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his ways, lo, they {are} written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 8. He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 9. And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 281. Ahaz was 20 when he became king and ruled for 16 years in Jerusalem. But he didn't follow the Lord's ways, unlike his dad David. 2. He was totally influenced by the lifestyle of the Israelite kings and even went as far as creating emoji-like statues for Baalim. 3. Also, he was into that incense vibe, like, in the valley of the son of Hinnom. And get this, he actually sacrificed his own children, like, literally burned them alive! He was copying the messed up stuff the non-believers used to do before God booted them out of Israel 4. He also did sacrifices and burnt incense in all the lit spots, like on top of the hills and under every chill tree. 5. So, like, God let the king of Syria capture him because he did bad stuff. The king of Syria and his people totally beat him up and took a bunch of them as prisoners to Damascus. But then, God also let the king of Israel defeat him real bad. Damascus is the place they're talking about, by the way. 6. Yo, Pekah, Remaliah's son, straight up took down a badass group of 120k dudes in Judah in just one day, 'cause they ditched the Lord God their ancestors worshipped. These dudes were no joke, all brave AF! #rekt #loyalty 7. So, this guy Zichri, who was like really strong and from Ephraim, totally took down Maaseiah, the son of the king, and Azrikam, the governor of the house, and Elkanah, who was like second in command to the king. (By the way, 'next...: Heb. the second to the king' means he was basically the king's right-hand person!) 8. So like, the Israelites totally captured around 200k of their own peeps – including women, sons, and daughters. Plus, they snagged a bunch of loot and brought it back to Samaria. 9. Yo, there was a total prophet of the LORD, named Oded, right there. So, he comes out in front of the whole crew rollin' up to Samaria and straight up tells them like, listen up! The LORD God of your fam was seriously mad at Judah, so He let y'all take 'em out, and you went all crazy and killed 'em like there was no tomorrow. 10. And now you guys are thinking about enslaving the children of Judah and Jerusalem as your servants? Like seriously? Don't y'all realize that you've already got enough sins against the LORD your God stacked up? 11. Listen up fam, it's time to free those prisoners you've been holding from your own clique. The Almighty's anger is totally fierce and directed at you, so peep the message and make it right. 12. So, like, these leaders from the peeps of Ephraim, we got Azariah (Johanan's kid), Berechiah (Meshillemoth's kid), Jehizkiah (Shallum's kid), and Amasa (Hadlai's kid). They took a stand against the peeps who came back from the battle. It was intense! 13. And he was like, 'No way, dudes! Don't even think about bringing those captives here. We've already messed up pretty bad with the Lord, and now you want to make it even worse? Our sins are already off the charts, and there's some serious anger brewing against Israel, man. 14. So, like, the soldiers dropped off the prisoners and all the cool stuff they took in front of the important people and everyone else. 15. Then the guys who were specifically named stepped up, and grabbed the prisoners, and decked out all the ones who were stark naked with some fresh clothes, and styled them up, and hooked them up with kicks, and made sure they got something to eat and drink, and even put some nice oil on them, and carried all the weak ones on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, which is that city with palm trees, to be with their squad. After that, they headed back to Samaria. 16. So, basically, King Ahaz was like, 'Yo, Assyrian kings, I need your backup right now.' 17. So, like, once again those Edomites came and totally attacked Judah, and took a bunch of people as prisoners. {captives: BTW, in Hebrew it means they were taken away, just so you know} 18. Yo, the Philistines straight up took over the cities in the low country and south of Judah. They grabbed Bethshemesh, Ajalon, Gederoth, Shocho and all its surrounding villages, plus Timnah and its villages, and even Gimzo along with its villages. They settled in and made it their own, no cap. 19. The LORD totally brought Judah down because of Ahaz, the king of Israel. Ahaz made Judah look foolish and straight-up rebelled against the LORD. 20. Then this Assyrian king, Tilgathpilneser, came and really messed with him, but didn't actually help him out. 21. So Ahaz straight-up swiped some stuff from the house of the LORD, and even snatched some goodies from the house of the king and the princes, and handed it all over to the king of Assyria. But guess what? It didn't help him at all. 22. And when things got tough, he kept disobeying the LORD even more: we're talking about King Ahaz, fam. 23. So, this guy was making offerings to the gods of Damascus, thinking they would protect him. He believed that since the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, they would also help him if he worships them. But this ended up being the downfall for him and all of Israel. (Just so you know, 'Damascus' means 'Darmesek' in Hebrew) 24. So Ahaz basically took all the holy stuff from God's house, trashed it into pieces, locked up the doors of the Lord's house, and then went around setting up altars everywhere you could find in Jerusalem. 25. He set up places in every city of Judah to burn incense to other gods, which made the LORD God of his ancestors very angry. 26. So, like, everything else this dude did and how he rolled, you can peep it all in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel, y'know? 27. So Ahaz died and was buried in Jerusalem, but he wasn't laid to rest in the tombs of the kings of Israel. After that, his son Hezekiah became the new ruler. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 281. Ahaz {was} twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father: 2. For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made also molten images for Baalim. 3. Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. {burnt...: or, offered sacrifice} 4. He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills, and under every green tree. 5. Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought {them} to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter. {Damascus: Heb. Darmesek} 6. For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day, {which were} all valiant men; because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. {valiant...: Heb. sons of valour} 7. And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah {that was} next to the king. {next...: Heb. the second to the king} 8. And the children of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria. 9. But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name {was} Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage {that} reacheth up unto heaven. 10. And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: {but are there} not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God? 11. Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of the LORD {is} upon you. 12. Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against them that came from the war, 13. And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD {already}, ye intend to add {more} to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and {there is} fierce wrath against Israel. 14. So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation. 15. And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria. 16. At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to help him. 17. For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried away captives. {captives: Heb. a captivity} 18. The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there. 19. For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the LORD. 20. And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not. 21. For Ahaz took away a portion {out} of the house of the LORD, and {out} of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave {it} unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not. 22. And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the LORD: this {is that} king Ahaz. 23. For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, {therefore} will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel. {Damascus: Heb. Darmesek} 24. And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem. 25. And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of his fathers. {to burn: or, to offer} 26. Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they {are} written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 27. And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, {even} in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 291. Hezekiah took the throne at the ripe age of 25 and ruled the city of Jerusalem for a cool 29 years. His mom's name was Abijah, daughter of Zechariah. 2. And he was, like, totally righteous in the eyes of the LORD, you know? He followed in the footsteps of his dad, David, and did everything just like him. 3. In his first year as king, during the first month, he went ahead and opened up the doors to the house of the LORD and fixed them up. 4. So he rounded up all the priests and Levites and gathered them on the east street. 5. Yo, listen up, Levites! It's time to get your act together, purify yourselves, and cleanse the house of the LORD God of your ancestors. Remove all the nasty stuff from this sacred space. 6. Yo, our ancestors messed up big time. They straight up did evil stuff that the LORD our God was not cool with. They ditched Him and turned away from where He lives. They basically dissed Him and turned their backs on Him. 7. Yo, they totally closed off the entrance, turned off the lights, and straight up neglected to light incense or make any burnt offerings in the sacred area for the God of Israel. 8. So, God was really mad at Judah and Jerusalem. He dealt them a whole lot of problems, like, serious trouble and even shocked them to the point of being totally amazed. People even made fun of them, like, can you believe it? You can actually see all this happening with your own eyes, no joke. {trouble: in Hebrew means commotion, just FYI} 9. Yo, listen up, our ancestors got wrecked in battle, and now our kids, partners, and the whole squad are stuck in captivity because of it. 10. So, like, I really wanna make a deal with the LORD God of Israel, you know? I hope that by doing this, His super intense anger will just cool off and not affect us anymore. 11. Yo dudes, don't slack off: 'cause the LORD chose you to be in his presence, to serve him, and do the whole incense thing. {don't be deceived} {offer sacrifice} 12. So, there were these Levites who stepped up: Mahath, who's Amasai's kid, and Joel, who's Azariah's kid. They were from the Kohathites. Then there were Kish, Abdi's offspring, and Azariah, Jehalelel's offspring, from the Merari family. And also, Joah, Zimmah's son, and Eden, Joah's son, who were from the Gershonites. 13. And Elizaphan's sons were Shimri and Jeiel, and Asaph's sons were Zechariah and Mattaniah. 14. So, these were Heman's kids - Jehiel and Shimei. And from Jeduthun's crew, we got Shemaiah and Uzziel. 15. And they gathered all their squad, prepared themselves, and rolled up to the house of the LORD, just like the king had ordered and following the words of the LORD, to purify the holy place. {or, to do some divine business} 16. So the priests went inside the super holy part of the LORD's house to clean it up and discovered a bunch of dirty stuff in the temple. They then dragged all that unclean stuff out to the courtyard of the LORD's house. The Levites took it from there and disposed of it in the Kidron Creek. 17. So, like, they started getting all holy on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day, they like, finally made it to the entrance of the LORD's place. And, you know, it took them a whole eight days to make the LORD's house all holy and stuff. So, yeah, on the sixteenth day of the first month, they were totally done with the whole sanctifying thing. 18. So they went to Hezekiah, the king, and were like, 'Yo, we totally cleaned the entire house of the LORD, including the altar for burnt offerings, all its stuff, and even the table for the showbread and its things.' 19. Yo, we've totally gathered up all those sick items that King Ahaz threw away during his rebellious phase, and we've totally blessed them and set them up right in front of the LORD's altar, you know? 20. So King Hezekiah woke up early, got all the city leaders together, and went to the house of the LORD. 21. So they came with seven bullocks, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats, as a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. Then he told the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, to offer them on the LORD's altar. 22. So they straight up slaughtered the bullocks, and the priests got the blood and legit sprinkled it on the altar. And yo, when they took down the rams, they also sprinkled the blood on the altar. They didn't hold back, man. They went ahead and killed the lambs too, and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 23. Then they brought out the male goats for the sin offering right in front of the king and the whole crew, and they placed their hands on them. 24. So, the priests went ahead and took care of that, you know? They made things right by sacrificing those animals and sprinkling their blood on the altar. This was like a way to fix things up and make peace with God for all the people of Israel. 'Cause the king, he said it was important to have these burnt offerings and sin offerings for everyone in Israel. 25. So like, he put the Levites in the house of the LORD and they were all playing cymbals, psalteries, and harps, just as David, Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet commanded, because that's what the LORD's prophets said he should do. Like, it was totally the LORD's command through his prophets, you know? 26. The Levites were totally rockin' out with David's instruments, and the priests were killin' it on the trumpets. 27. So Hezekiah was like, 'Yo, let's offer this burnt offering on the altar.' And when they started doing that, they started playing this awesome song for the Lord with trumpets and instruments that were chosen by David, the king of Israel. It all happened at the same time, you know? 28. And the whole crew totally vibed, with the singers straight up slaying and the trumpeters bringing the hype. This epic jam sesh went on until they were totally done with the burnt offering. (Note: In Hebrew, 'singers' means they were dropping some sick beats.) 29. And after they finished giving their offering, the king and everyone there with him humbled themselves and showed reverence. 30. BTW, King Hezekiah and the VIPs told the Levites to flex their singing skills and worship the LORD using David and Asaph's lit lyrics. They sang with mad joy, bowing their heads and gettin' their worship on. 🔥 31. So Hezekiah was like, 'Yo, you guys have totally dedicated yourselves to the LORD. Come closer and bring sacrifices and thankful offerings to the house of the LORD.' And the whole crew brought in sacrifices and thankful offerings, and those who were feelin' it in their hearts brought burnt offerings willingly. 32. And the total number of burnt offerings the gang brought was sixty-nine bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs. All of these were offered as a sacrifice to the LORD. 33. Yo, the holy stuff was like 600 cows and 3000 sheep, insane right?! 34. But like, there weren't enough priests to, like, skin all the burnt offerings, you know? So, their fellow Levites totally stepped in and helped them out until the job was done. And it was only after the other priests had purified themselves that the Levites showed how dedicated they were to purifying themselves too. Because, like, the Levites were all about having pure hearts and stuff, even more than the priests. 35. Plus, there were heaps of burnt offerings with all that fatty goodness from the peace offerings and drinks to go with every burnt offering. The whole shebang was perfectly organized, just how the house of the LORD liked it. 36. And Hezekiah was hyped, and all the people were stoked, because God straight up set up the people: 'cause the whole thing happened outta nowhere. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 291. Hezekiah began to reign {when he was} five and twenty years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name {was} Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah. 2. And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father had done. 3. He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them. 4. And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the east street, 5. And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy {place}. 6. For our fathers have trespassed, and done {that which was} evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned {their} backs. {turned their...: Heb. given the neck} 7. Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy {place} unto the God of Israel. 8. Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing, as ye see with your eyes. {trouble: Heb. commotion} 9. For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives {are} in captivity for this. 10. Now {it is} in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us. 11. My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him, and burn incense. {be not...: or, be not now deceived} {burn...: or, offer sacrifice} 12. Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah: 13. And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah: 14. And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel. 15. And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD. {by the words...: or, in the business of the LORD} 16. And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the LORD, to cleanse {it}, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And the Levites took {it}, to carry {it} out abroad into the brook Kidron. 17. Now they began on the first {day} of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end. 18. Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the vessels thereof. 19. Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold, they {are} before the altar of the LORD. 20. Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of the city, and went up to the house of the LORD. 21. And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer {them} on the altar of the LORD. 22. So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled {it} on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar. 23. And they brought forth the he goats {for} the sin offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them: {forth: Heb. near} 24. And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the king commanded {that} the burnt offering and the sin offering {should be made} for all Israel. 25. And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet: for {so was} the commandment of the LORD by his prophets. {commandment of the LORD: Heb. commandment by the hand of the LORD} {by: Heb. by the hand of} 26. And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets. 27. And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began {also} with the trumpets, and with the instruments {ordained} by David king of Israel. {when: Heb. in the time} {the instruments: Heb. hands of instruments} 28. And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded: {and} all {this continued} until the burnt offering was finished. {singers: Heb. song} 29. And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped. {present: Heb. found} 30. Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped. 31. Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings. {consecrated...: or, filled your hand} 32. And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, {and} two hundred lambs: all these {were} for a burnt offering to the LORD. 33. And the consecrated things {were} six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep. 34. But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the {other} priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites {were} more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. {did help...: Heb. strengthened them} 35. And also the burnt offerings {were} in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for {every} burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order. 36. And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people: for the thing was {done} suddenly. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 301. So Hezekiah hit up all the peeps in Israel and Judah, and even slid into the DMs of Ephraim and Manasseh, telling them to roll through to the crib of the LORD in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover with the one and only God of Israel. 2. So the king, his crew, and everyone in Jerusalem got together and decided to celebrate Passover in the second month. 3. So, like, they couldn't do it back then since the priests didn't fully prepare themselves, and the people didn't come together in Jerusalem. 4. And the king and all the fam were totally vibing with it. {vibing...: like, yeah, the king was totally down with that} 5. So they made a rule and spread the word all over Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, telling everyone to come and celebrate the Passover to honor the LORD God of Israel in Jerusalem. It had been a super long time since they had done it the way it was written. 6. So like, these posts were totally sent out with letters from the king and his crew all over Israel and Judah, ya know? And like, the king was all like, 'Hey, you children of Israel! It's time to come back to the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. If you do, He'll totally look out for the rest of you who survived the kings of Assyria, so you won't be messed with anymore.' 7. Don't be like your parents and siblings who messed up and angered the LORD God of their ancestors. As a result, God let them suffer and you can see the consequences. 8. Don't be stubborn like your ancestors, but instead surrender yourselves to the LORD and step into his sacred place, which he has blessed forever. Serve the LORD your God, so that his anger won't come crashing down on you. 9. If y'all come back to the LORD, your squad and your fam will get mad love from the ones who are holding them captive. They'll make their way back to this place, 'cause the LORD your God is all about showing grace and mercy, and won't ignore y'all when y'all come back to him. 10. So like, the messages went around from city to city, like, going through Ephraim and Manasseh, all the way to Zebulun, but everyone just, you know, laughed at them and made fun of them. 11. But, like, there were some cool people from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun who were like, 'Hey, let's take a step back and show some humility.' So they made their way to Jerusalem, you know? 12. In Judah, God totally united everyone and made them all follow the king and the princes, all because of what the LORD said. 13. A ton of people came together in Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of unleavened bread during the second month. It was a massive gathering, no cap. 14. And they yeeted the altars in Jerusalem, and straight up snatched all the incense altars, and yeeted them into the brook Kidron. 15. And so, they celebrated the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites felt kinda embarrassed, but they still got their act together, purified themselves, and brought the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD. 16. And they did their thing, just like Moses the man of God said: the priests sprayed the blood, which they got from the Levites. (their thing: Hebrew their vibin) 17. There were a bunch of people in the crew who hadn't been purified yet, so the Levites were responsible for slaughtering the passovers for anyone who wasn't clean, to make them holy for the LORD. 18. So, like, there were a ton of people - I'm talking Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun - who didn't bother to clean themselves up before having the passover feast. They totally did it differently than what was written. But Hezekiah, he was all about them prayers, man. He asked the good LORD to forgive them all, you know? 19. If someone's heart is set on finding God, the LORD God of their ancestors, even if they haven't gone through all the religious rituals and stuff. 20. And God totally listened to Hezekiah and healed all the peeps. 21. The peeps of Israel in Jerusalem totally celebrated the feast of unleavened bread for a whole week and it was lit! The Levites and the priests were all about praising the LORD every single day, belting it out with their loud instruments. #blessed 22. So Hezekiah spoke to all the Levites who were spreading the lit knowledge of the LORD, and they totally feasted for a whole week, making peace offerings and confessing to the LORD God of their ancestors. 23. And the whole squad decided to extend the festivities for another seven days: and they kept partying for another seven days with mad joy. 24. So Hezekiah, the king of Judah, gave the congregation one thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep. And the princes also gave the congregation one thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep. Plus, there were a bunch of priests who purified themselves. 25. And like, everyone in Judah, including the priests, Levites, and all the people who came from Israel, even the outsiders who moved to Judah, totally celebrated! 26. Bruh, Jerusalem was lit AF! It hadn't been this lit since Solomon, David's son, was the king of Israel. It was straight-up epic vibes in Jerusalem, no cap. 27. The priests, aka the Levites, stood up and blessed the people. Their voices were totally heard, and their prayer reached up to God's super sacred crib, aka his holy dwelling place, all the way to heaven. It was like, straight up divine. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 301. And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel. 2. For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month. 3. For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem. 4. And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation. {pleased...: Heb. was right in the eyes of the king} 5. So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done {it} of a long {time in such sort} as it was written. 6. So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria. {from: Heb. from the hand} 7. And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, {who} therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see. 8. Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers {were, but} yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you. {be ye...: Heb. harden not your necks} {yield...: Heb. give the hand} 9. For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children {shall find} compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God {is} gracious and merciful, and will not turn away {his} face from you, if ye return unto him. 10. So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them. 11. Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem. 12. Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the LORD. 13. And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation. 14. And they arose and took away the altars that {were} in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast {them} into the brook Kidron. 15. Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth {day} of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the LORD. 16. And they stood in their place after their manner, according to the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, {which they received} of the hand of the Levites. {their place: Heb. their standing} 17. For {there were} many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one {that was} not clean, to sanctify {them} unto the LORD. 18. For a multitude of the people, {even} many of Ephraim, and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one 19. {That} prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his fathers, though {he be} not {cleansed} according to the purification of the sanctuary. 20. And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people. 21. And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, {singing} with loud instruments unto the LORD. {present: Heb. found} {loud...: Heb. instruments of strength} 22. And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD God of their fathers. {comfortably...: Heb. to the heart of all} 23. And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days: and they kept {other} seven days with gladness. 24. For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves. {did give: Heb. lifted up, or, offered} {gave: Heb. lifted up, or, offered} 25. And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced. 26. So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel {there was} not the like in Jerusalem. 27. Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came {up} to his holy dwelling place, {even} unto heaven. {his holy...: Heb. the habitation of his holiness} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 311. And once they had completed everything, all the people of Israel who were there went out to the towns of Judah and smashed the statues, cut down the trees, and demolished all the fancy places of worship and altars throughout Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh. They didn't stop until everything was completely wiped out. After that, all the Israelites went back to their own towns and reclaimed their own land. 2. And Hezekiah made a plan for the priests and the Levites, each assigned to their own duties. The priests and Levites were in charge of the burnt offerings and peace offerings, as well as serving, giving thanks, and praising in the sacred areas of the LORD's dwelling. 3. He also gave a share of his wealth to the king for the morning and evening sacrifices, as well as for the sacrifices on the sabbaths, new moons, and festivals, just as it was written in the LORD's law. 4. He told the folks living in Jerusalem to share some of their resources with the priests and Levites, so they could stay motivated in following God's commands. 5. When word got out about the command, the Israelites wasted no time in bringing in loads of the best crops - corn, wine, oil, honey, and all the other goodies they harvested from their fields. They enthusiastically gave a generous tenth of everything they had. 6. So, like, the Israelite and Judah peeps who were living in the cities of Judah, they totally brought in their tithes of oxen and sheep, you know? And they also brought in tithes of holy stuff that was dedicated to the LORD their God, and they piled it all up into big heaps. Yeah, like, heaps of heaps, you feel me? 7. In the third month, they started building the piles, and by the seventh month, they completed them. 8. When Hezekiah and the squad rolled up and saw the stacks, they gave mad props to the LORD and his homies, the people of Israel. 9. So Hezekiah was like, yo, he gathered the priests and the Levites and asked them about all these piles of stuff. 10. And like, Azariah, the main priest from the house of Zadok, totally responded and was like, 'Dude, ever since the peeps started bringing the offerings to the house of the LORD, we've been fully fed and had enough leftovers too, ya know? 'Cause the LORD has totally blessed us, and we've got this massive surplus left.' 11. So Hezekiah was like, 'Yo, we gotta get some rooms ready up in this house of the LORD.' And they went ahead and got those rooms all set up, you know, like storehouses and stuff. 12. And they brought in the offerings, the tithes, and the dedicated stuff, like, all 100% faithfully. Cononiah, the epic Levite, was totally in charge of that, and his homie Shimei was his right-hand bro. 13. Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were in charge, working under Cononiah and his brother Shimei. They were following the orders of King Hezekiah and Azariah, the leader of God's house. 14. Kore, the son of Imnah the Levite, had the important job of being the gatekeeper on the east side. He was in charge of handling all the offerings that people willingly gave to God and distributing them, including the special sacred items. 15. And beside them were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, working in the cities of the priests, in their designated positions, to distribute to their fellow brothers and sisters in organized groups, regardless of rank: whether they were important or not so important. 16. And they kept track of all the guys who were at least three years old and older, and they were responsible for everything that happened in the house of the LORD. They each had their daily tasks and responsibilities based on their assigned roles. 17. So basically, this is a list of all the priests and Levites, tracing back their family lines. The Levites included those who were at least twenty years old and above, and they were responsible for different tasks in their assigned rotations. 18. And to all their fams, their wifeys, their bros, and their sis, throughout the whole crew. Cuz they were on point, they made themselves all holy and stuff, ya know? #Trust 19. Among the sons of Aaron, who were the priests, there were dudes in the chill outskirts of their cities, in each city. These were the homies who were well-known and responsible for hooking up the guy priests with their share, as well as the Levites who were all about family histories and stuff. 20. And Hezekiah, like totally, did all these awesome things in the land of Judah. He was all about doing what was upright, righteous, and keeping it real, before his God, the LORD. 21. And in every task he did for the house of God, following the law and commandments, seeking his God, he gave it his all and thrived. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 311. Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities. {present: Heb. found} {images: Heb. statues} {until...: Heb. until to make an end} 2. And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD. 3. {He appointed} also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, {to wit}, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as {it is} written in the law of the LORD. 4. Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the LORD. 5. And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all {things} brought they in abundantly. {came...: Heb. brake forth} {honey: or, dates} 6. And {concerning} the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid {them} by heaps. {by heaps: Heb. heaps, heaps} 7. In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps, and finished {them} in the seventh month. 8. And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the LORD, and his people Israel. 9. Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps. 10. And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered him, and said, Since {the people} began to bring the offerings into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left {is} this great store. 11. Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the LORD; and they prepared {them}, {chambers: or, storehouses} 12. And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated {things} faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite {was} ruler, and Shimei his brother {was} the next. 13. And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, {were} overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God. {under...: Heb. at the hand} 14. And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the east, {was} over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things. 15. And next him {were} Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in {their} set office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to the small: {next...: Heb. at his hand} {set...: or, trust} 16. Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, {even} unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses; 17. Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses; 18. And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness: {set...: or, trust} 19. Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, {which were} in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites. 20. And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought {that which was} good and right and truth before the LORD his God. 21. And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did {it} with all his heart, and prospered. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 321. So, like, after all that happened and everything was set up, Sennacherib, this Assyrian king, like totally rolled up in Judah and set up camp near the fortified cities. And get this, he actually thought he could conquer them and make 'em his own, you know? But he was like, 'Nah, I'll just break 'em up.' 2. So, when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had arrived and was planning to attack Jerusalem, he was not messing around and ready to go to war. 3. He discussed with his squad and his crew to block the flow of the fountains outside the city, and they totally had his back. 4. So, like, a big crowd got together and they totally blocked off all the fountains and the brook that flowed through the middle of the land. They were like, 'Why should those kings from Assyria come and have access to all this water?' 5. Then he flexed his muscles, and fixed all the broken walls like a pro, adding extra towers and an outer wall. He even repaired Millo in the city of David and crafted a ton of darts and shields. #Skillz #GettinItDone 6. And he appointed war leaders to oversee the people, bringing them together at the city gate, where he addressed them with kindness and encouragement, saying, 'Yo, listen up! I'm here to speak straight to your hearts.' 7. Stay strong and fearless, don't let the king of Assyria or his posse intimidate you. We've got way more backup than him! 8. He may have his human strength, but we've got the LORD our God on our side, ready to help us and fight our battles. And the people trusted and relied on the words of Hezekiah, the cool king of Judah. 🙌 9. So, like, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, sent his crew to Jerusalem, while he himself was busy attacking Lachish with all his power. They rolled up to Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and all the peeps in Judah hanging out in Jerusalem, and were like, 'Yo, we got dominion over here! 10. Yo, listen up! Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, was like, 'What's up with you guys in Jerusalem, chillin' in the middle of a siege? Like, where's your trust coming from?' 11. Isn't Hezekiah trying to convince you to not surrender to starving and dehydrating? He's saying, 'Don't worry, God's got our back and will save us from the Assyrian king!' 12. Didn't Hezekiah, like, remove all his fancy worship spots and altars and tell everyone in Judah and Jerusalem that they had to worship at just one altar and burn incense there? 13. Yo, don't you know what me and my ancestors did to all the peeps in other countries? Were the gods of those nations even able to save their lands from me? 14. Like, seriously, out of all those gods the other nations worshipped, my ancestors totally wiped them out. So, tell me, is there any chance that your God can save you from me? Doubt it, tbh. 15. So, like, don't get duped by Hezekiah or let him convince you otherwise. Don't even think about believing him. 'Cause seriously, no god from any country or kingdom had the power to save their people from me and my ancestors. So, how on earth do you think your God will be able to save you from me? 16. And his squad talked mad trash about the LORD God and his homie Hezekiah. 17. He sent some mad hate letters, dissing the LORD God of Israel, talking trash about him, saying, 'Yo, like all the gods of those other countries couldn't save their people from me, so the God of Hezekiah won't save his people either, fam.' 18. So, like, they shouted real loud in the Jews' language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, you know, to scare them and like, make them uneasy, so they could, you know, capture the city. 19. And they were like so disrespecting the God of Jerusalem, talking trash about Him, and treating Him like just any other man-made god. 20. So Hezekiah, the king, and Isaiah, the prophet who's Amoz's son, were like, super desperate and sent their prayers and cries up to heaven. 21. Then God sent an angel who defeated all the strong and brave warriors, as well as the leaders and commanders in the king of Assyria's army. So the king returned home feeling humiliated. And when he entered the temple of his god, his own family members attacked and killed him there with a sword. 22. So, like, the LORD totally came through for Hezekiah and the peeps in Jerusalem, like, for real, and saved them from that Sennacherib dude, the king of Assyria, and, like, all the other bad guys, and, you know, like, guided them and protected them from all directions. 23. And, like, a bunch of people brought gifts to the LORD in Jerusalem, and also gave presents to Hezekiah, the king of Judah. It was a big deal, and he totally gained a ton of respect from all the nations after that. They were like, 'Woah, this dude is legit!' 24. Back in the day, Hezekiah was on his deathbed, feeling really sick, and he reached out to the LORD in prayer. And guess what? The LORD had a chat with him and even threw in a little miracle to prove His power. It was amazing! 25. But Hezekiah didn't show gratitude for what was given to him because he got too full of himself: that's why he and Judah and Jerusalem faced some serious consequences. 26. But like, Hezekiah totally checked his ego and was all humble, both him and the peeps in Jerusalem, so God wasn't even mad at them during Hezekiah's time. #NoWrath 27. Hezekiah was hella rich and respected. He flexed with his money by building storage spaces for tons of silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all sorts of fancy bling that people wanted. 28. And, like, there were these huge spaces to stock up on, like, tons of crops, and wine, and oil, plus cool pens for all kinds of animals, and fancy enclosures for all the flocks. 29. He hooked him up with mad cities and tons of animals, like, so many sheep and cows. God really blessed him with mad wealth and stuff. 30. Yo, this dude Hezekiah, he straight up redirected the Gihon River to flow down to the west side of the city of David. And you know what? Hezekiah be ballin' in everything he does, thriving like a boss. 31. But when the ambassadors from the big shots of Babylon hit him up to get the lowdown on the crazy stuff happening in his land, God dipped out and left him hanging. He wanted to test him and see what was really going on in his heart. #trustissues 32. So, like, all the other cool stuff that Hezekiah did and how awesome he was, you can find it in the vision written by Isaiah the prophet, son of Amoz. It's also in this super legit book about the kings of Judah and Israel. You know, it's all about his mad kindness and stuff. #Impressive 33. And Hezekiah passed away, and they laid him to rest in the fanciest tomb among the descendants of David. All of Judah and the people of Jerusalem paid their respects to him when he died. Then his son Manasseh took over as the new ruler. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 321. After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself. {to win...: Heb. to break them up} 2. And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem, {he was...: Heb. his face was to war} 3. He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which {were} without the city: and they did help him. 4. So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find much water? {ran: Heb. overflowed} 5. Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised {it} up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo {in} the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance. {darts: or, swords, or, weapons} 6. And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, {spake...: Heb. he spoke to their heart} 7. Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that {is} with him: for {there be} more with us than with him: 8. With him {is} an arm of flesh; but with us {is} the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah. {rested...: Heb. leaned} 9. After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem, (but he {himself laid siege} against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that {were} at Jerusalem, saying, {power: Heb. dominion} 10. Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem? {siege: or, strong hold} 11. Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 12. Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it? 13. Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of {other} lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand? 14. Who {was there} among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand? 15. Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand? 16. And his servants spake yet {more} against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah. 17. He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of {other} lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand. 18. Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of Jerusalem that {were} on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city. 19. And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the people of the earth, {which were} the work of the hands of man. 20. And for this {cause} Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven. 21. And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword. {slew...: Heb. made him fall} 22. Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all {other}, and guided them on every side. 23. And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth. {presents: Heb. precious things} 24. In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign. {gave...: or, wrought a miracle for him} 25. But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit {done} unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem. 26. Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, {both} he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. {pride: Heb. lifting up} 27. And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; {pleasant...: Heb. instruments of desire} 28. Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. 29. Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much. 30. This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. 31. Howbeit in {the business of} the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was {done} in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all {that was} in his heart. {ambassadors: Heb. interpreters} 32. Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they {are} written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, {and} in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. {goodness: Heb. kindnesses} 33. And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead. {chiefest: or, highest} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 331. Manasseh was just 12 years old when he started being in charge, and he ruled over Jerusalem for a total of 55 years: 2. But they did stuff that was super messed up according to God, you know, like the gross things other people were doing that God already kicked out before the Israelites. 3. Like, he totally rebuilt those fancy religious spots that Hezekiah, his dad, had demolished. And not only that, he went ahead and set up altars for Baalim, made some groves, and straight-up worshipped all the celestials. He was like, serving them and all. 4. He also set up some sick altars in the house of the LORD, just like the LORD had said, 'My name is gonna be in Jerusalem forever, no cap'. 5. And yo, he straight up constructed altars for all the cool celestial beings in both the courts, like, inside the house of the LORD. 6. And he made his children go through some intense stuff in this creepy valley called the son of Hinnom: he did all these weird rituals, like trying to predict the future, casting spells, dabbling in witchcraft and summoning spirits like he's in some kind of magic show. And let me tell you, all this messed up stuff he did really ticked off the LORD, made Him super angry. 7. So, he like put this statue thingy, which he made on his own, in God's crib. That crib was legit special, 'cause God told David and Solomon that He'd be all up in that house, in Jerusalem, and that it's gonna be the spot where His name will always be. No cap, fam. 8. I ain't gonna kick Israel out of the land I gave to your ancestors anymore. They better pay attention and do everything I told them through Moses, like following the whole law and all the rules. 9. Manasseh totally led the people of Judah and Jerusalem astray, making them do even worse things than the non-believers that God had already wiped out when the Israelites first came in. 10. So, like, the LORD had something to say to Manasseh and his crew, but they were like, not even listening, you know? 11. So, because the LORD was mad at them, He allowed the boss of the king of Assyria and his army to capture Manasseh and drag him away to Babylon. They put him in chains and took him away, man! 12. When things got tough, he reached out to the LORD his God, and showed mad respect and humility before the God of his ancestors. 13. So he reached out to Him in prayer, and God listened and answered his plea, bringing him back to Jerusalem and restoring him to his rightful place as king. It was at that moment that Manasseh realized that the LORD, He was truly God. 14. So, like, later on he constructed this big wall outside the city of David, y'know, on the western side of Gihon in the valley. It stretched all the way to the entrance at the fish gate and surrounded Ophel. He made it super tall and made sure to assign war leaders to all the fortified cities in Judah. (Ophel can also be called the tower, just FYI) 15. Then he got rid of all those funky gods and that ugly statue from the Lord's crib, along with all the altars he built on the holy mountain and in Jerusalem, and yeeted 'em right outta the city. 16. So, like, he totally fixed up the LORD's altar and made some chill peace offerings and thanksgiving offerings. And he was all like, 'Yo, Judah, let's serve the LORD God of Israel together, okay?' 17. But the people kept sacrificing in the high places, like, only to the LORD their God. 18. So, like, there's more stuff about Manasseh that went down. He had this epic prayer sesh with his God, and the seers were totally dropping wisdom on him in the name of the LORD God of Israel. You gotta check out the deets in the book of the kings of Israel, it's all there! 19. Yo, this dude's prayer game was strong and God totally heard him out. But we gotta talk about his past sins, those high places, groves, and graven images he was messing with before he got humbled. All the deets about that are straight up recorded by the seers, you feel me? 20. And then Manasseh passed away, and they laid him to rest in his own crib. After that, his son Amon took over as the boss. 21. Amon was just 22 when he took charge, holding it down for a solid two years in Jerusalem. 22. But, like, he totally did something super not cool in the eyes of the LORD, just like his dad Manasseh. Amon was all about sacrificing to those fancy carved images that his dad made and worshiping them and stuff. 23. And he didn't show humility before the LORD like his father Manasseh did; instead, Amon kept doing more and more wrong things. {kept doing more and more wrong things: Heb. multiplied his wrongdoings} 24. And his homies plotted against him, and straight up took him out in his crib. 25. But yo, the peeps of the land straight up took out all those who plotted against king Amon, and the homies of the land legit made Josiah, his son, the new king in his place. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 331. Manasseh {was} twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem: 2. But did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, like unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel. 3. For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. {he built...: Heb. he returned and built} 4. Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever. 5. And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. 6. And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 7. And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 8. Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses. 9. So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to err, {and} to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had destroyed before the children of Israel. 10. And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken. 11. Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon. {of the king: Heb. which were the king's} {fetters: or, chains} 12. And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers, 13. And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he {was} God. 14. Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah. {Ophel: or, the tower} 15. And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast {them} out of the city. 16. And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. 17. Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, {yet} unto the LORD their God only. 18. Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they {are written} in the book of the kings of Israel. 19. His prayer also, and {how God} was intreated of him, and all his sin, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they {are} written among the sayings of the seers. {the seers: or, Hosai} 20. So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. 21. Amon {was} two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem. 22. But he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them; 23. And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more. {trespassed more and more: Heb. multiplied trespass} 24. And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house. 25. But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 341. Josiah was just 8 years old when he became the king, and he ruled over Jerusalem for a solid 31 years. 2. And he totally did what was lit in the eyes of the LORD, and followed the footsteps of his OG dad David, and didn't stray off the path, not even a little bit. 3. In the eighth year of his reign, when he was still pretty young, he started searching for the God of his dad David. Then, in the twelfth year, he started getting rid of all the worship sites, forests, fancy statues, and metal statues in Judah and Jerusalem. 4. And they totally destroyed the altars dedicated to false gods that were in front of them. They smashed the statues that were placed up high, knocked down the grove of trees, shattered the carved and melted statues into tiny pieces, and scattered the remains on top of the graves of those who worshiped them. (The statues may have represented the sun.) (The graves were the visible part of the graves.) 5. And he totally roasted those priests' bones on their altars, like fire emoji level burned. He straight up purified Judah and Jerusalem, no cap. 6. And he did the same in all the chill cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and even Naphtali, with their tools in hand. (Tools meaning like, hammers or mauls or whatever) 7. So, like, this dude totally destroyed all the altars and the groves, smashed those graven images into tiny pieces, and totally got rid of all those idols in the whole land of Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem. Schmood, right?! 8. So, like, in the 18th year of his reign, after cleaning up the whole land and the house, he hit up Shaphan (Azaliah's kid), Maaseiah (the city governor), and Joah sonn of Joahaz, the record keeper) to fix up the house of the LORD his God. 9. So, when they went to Hilkiah, the top priest, they gave him the cash that had been brought into God's house. The Levites, who were responsible for guarding the doors, had collected it from the hands of Manasseh, Ephraim, and all the other people of Israel, as well as those from Judah and Benjamin. Then, they all returned back to Jerusalem. 10. And they gave it to the workers in charge of the house of the LORD, and they handed it to the workers who were fixing and improving the house of the LORD: 11. They even gave it to the skilled workers and builders, so they could purchase carved stone and wood for construction, and repair the homes that were destroyed by the kings of Judah. (To fix the floors or add rafters, you know!) 12. And the dudes did the work like real champs: Jahath and Obadiah were the bosses, they were from the Levite crew, descendants of Merari. Zechariah and Meshullam, from the Kohathites fam, were in charge of making sure things ran smoothly. And there were other skilled Levites who knew how to jam on musical instruments. 13. They were also in charge of managing the logistics and overseeing all the tasks performed in various services. Among the Levites, there were scribes, officers, and porters. 14. So, like, when they were checking out the cash that was brought into God's crib, Hilkiah the priest stumbled upon this book of laws from God that Moses gave us. Just passing it on, you know? 15. So Hilkiah was like, hey Shaphan, dude, guess what? I just found the book of the law up in the house of the LORD! And then Hilkiah passed the book over to Shaphan. 16. So Shaphan took the book to the king and told him what it said. He said, 'All the things we were supposed to do, we did them.' 17. So they rounded up all the cash they found in the LORD's crib and handed it over to the bosses and the workers. {gathered together: a total flex} 18. So, like, Shaphan, the scribe, goes up to the king and is like, 'Yo, Hilkiah the priest gave me this sick book, dude.' And then, Shaphan starts reading it in front of the king, you know? 19. So, like, the king was all, listening to the law and stuff, and he got so worked up that he tore his clothes, man. 20. So the king was like, yo Hilkiah, Ahikam sonn of Shaphan), Abdon sonn of Micah), Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah (a servant of the king), listen up. And by the way, Abdon could also be called Achbor, just FYI. 21. Hey, go hit up the LORD for me and for the peeps who are still in Israel and Judah. We need some answers about the stuff written in that book we found. The LORD is super mad at us 'cause our ancestors didn't follow His word and do all the things it says in this book. 22. Hilkiah and the crew that the king handpicked went to talk to Huldah the prophetess. She was married to Shallum, Tikvath's son, who was the son of Hasrah. By the way, Hasrah was in charge of the fashionable clothes. Huldah was living in Jerusalem, chilling in the college. So they had a little chat with her to get some insight. (BTW, Hasrah was also known as Harhas, and the wardrobe was all about those trendy garments. And when we say college, we mean like a school or maybe the second part of somewhere.) 23. And she replied to them, like, listen up y'all, this is straight from the big man upstairs, the LORD God of Israel. So go tell the dude who sent you to me, 24. Yo, listen up! The LORD's got something important to say. Check it: He's about to unleash some serious trouble on this place and everyone who lives here. Like, all the bad stuff that's written down in that book the king of Judah read? Yeah, it's all going down. 25. Because they straight up ditched me and started worshipping other gods, thinking it would tick me off with all the stuff they made. So now I'm totally fed up and my anger is gonna go full blast on this spot, and it's gonna be intense, no chance of putting it out. 26. Hey, when you talk to the king of Judah who sent you to ask the LORD, here's what you gotta say: 'This is what the LORD God of Israel has to say about the stuff you heard.' 27. Your heart was mad soft, and you totally humbled yourself before God when you heard what He had to say about this place and the people living here. You straight up came to me, tore your clothes, and cried your eyes out. I gotta admit, I heard you loud and clear, says the LORD. 28. Yo, listen up! I'm gonna take you to your ancestors, and you'll peacefully rest in your final crib. You won't even have to witness all the bad stuff that's gonna go down here and affect those who stick around. Word got back to the king, just like I told ya! 29. So the king hits up all the OGs in Judah and Jerusalem to come over. 30. So the king, along with all the dudes from Judah, the peeps from Jerusalem, the priests, the Levites, and basically everyone, whether they're VIP or just a regular person, went into the house of the LORD. And there, he straight up read out loud all the words from the book of the covenant that they found in the house of the LORD. Like, from the boss man to the smallest homie, they all got to hear it. 31. The king was like, 'Yo, I'm standin' right here, and I'm makin' a pact with the LORD. I'm gonna straight up follow the LORD, keepin' all His rules, and doin' what He says with my whole heart and soul. I'm gonna do everything that's written in this book, word for word. 32. And he made everyone in Jerusalem and Benjamin get in on it. And the peeps in Jerusalem totally kept their word, just like their ancestors did, you know?! 33. Josiah straight up eliminated all the disgusting stuff going on in all the countries where the Israelites were chilling. He made everyone in Israel serve the LORD their God, no doubt about it. And let me tell you, throughout his whole life, they never strayed away from following the LORD, the God of their ancestors. Like, they were totally committed! \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 341. Josiah {was} eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years. 2. And he did {that which was} right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father, and declined {neither} to the right hand, nor to the left. 3. For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images. 4. And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that {were} on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust {of them}, and strowed {it} upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them. {the images: or, the sun images} {graves: Heb. face of the graves} 5. And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem. 6. And {so did he} in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about. {mattocks: or, mauls} 7. And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem. {into...: Heb. to make powder} 8. Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God. 9. And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem. 10. And they put {it} in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and amend the house: 11. Even to the artificers and builders gave they {it}, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed. {to floor: or, to rafter} 12. And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them {were} Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to set {it} forward; and {other of} the Levites, all that could skill of instruments of musick. 13. Also {they were} over the bearers of burdens, and {were} overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of the Levites {there were} scribes, and officers, and porters. 14. And when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the LORD {given} by Moses. {by: Heb. by the hand of} 15. And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan. 16. And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy servants, they do {it}. {to thy...: Heb. to the hand of, etc} 17. And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen. {gathered together: Heb. poured out, or, melted} 18. Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king. {it: Heb. in it} 19. And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes. 20. And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king's, saying, {Abdon: or, Achbor} 21. Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found: for great {is} the wrath of the LORD that is poured out upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do after all that is written in this book. 22. And Hilkiah, and {they} that the king {had appointed}, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that {effect}. {Hasrah: also called, Harhas} {wardrobe: Heb. garments} {in the college: or, in the school, or, in the second part} 23. And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell ye the man that sent you to me, 24. Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, {even} all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah: 25. Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched. 26. And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel {concerning} the words which thou hast heard; 27. Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard {thee} also, saith the LORD. 28. Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again. 29. Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 30. And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD. {great...: Heb. from great even to small} 31. And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book. 32. And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand {to it}. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers. {present: Heb. found} 33. And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that {pertained} to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, {even} to serve the LORD their God. {And} all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers. {present: Heb. found} {from...: Heb. from after} \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 351. Anyway, Josiah decided to throw a lit passover party for the LORD in Jerusalem. They straight up slaughtered the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. It was a total vibe! 2. And he assigned the priests their tasks, and gave them mad motivation to serve the house of the LORD, 3. So the Levites were instructed, the ones who were set apart for the LORD, to place the sacred ark in the house that King Solomon, son of David of Israel, had built. This way, they wouldn't have to carry the heavy load on their shoulders. Their task now was to serve the LORD their God and the people of Israel. 4. Get ready, fam, by your ancestral homes, just like your dads did in the good old days, following the instructions written by King David of Israel and his son, King Solomon. 5. And like, make sure you're all hanging out in the sacred spot, you know, based on your fam's ancestry and all, just like the Levites do. It's all about sticking with your fam and your peeps, ya feel me? 6. Yo, it's time to slay the passover offering, get yourselves ready, and help out your peeps so they can follow the word of the LORD through Moses. 7. Yo, Josiah hooked the people up with some lit passover offerings. He gave them mad lambs and goats from his own stash, like a total of 30k, and 3k beefy bulls. It was all from the king's riches, you know? 8. And the leaders generously gave to the people, the priests, and the Levites: Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, who were in charge of the house of God, gave two thousand six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen as offerings for the passover. They gave willingly, offering them with a sincere heart. 9. Conaniah, Shemaiah, Nethaneel, Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, who were the leaders of the Levites, gave five thousand cute little farm animals and five hundred big cows as offerings for the Passover feast. (They gave these offerings with sincere hearts.) 10. So like, everything was all set up for the service, and the priests were like in their spots, and the Levites were in their groups, just doing what the king told them to do. 11. Then they slaughtered the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands, and the Levites skinned them. 12. They took away the burnt offerings to distribute them among the different families, just like it says in the book of Moses. And they did the same thing with the oxen. 13. And they totally roasted the passover in fire like it was the ultimate cook-off challenge: but the other holy offerings were cooked up in pots, caldrons, and pans, and quickly shared out among all the people. (divided...: It was split up super fast) 14. And then they got themselves organized, both the regular people and the priests. You see, the priests, who were the sons of Aaron, were super busy offering burnt sacrifices and dealing with the fatty parts of the animals until it was nighttime. So, the Levites took charge and prepared everything not just for themselves, but also for the priests, who were the sons of Aaron. 15. And the singers, the cool dudes who have mad vocal skills, like Asaph's sons, were doing their thing, just as David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's seer, had commanded. Meanwhile, the gatekeepers were holding it down at each gate, committed to their job; they couldn't dip out because their fellow Levite homies were looking out for them. (Station: Hebrew for 'where they were posted') 16. So, like, everything that needed to be done for the LORD was totally set up in one day. They were getting ready to celebrate the passover and make burnt offerings on the LORD's altar, just like king Josiah ordered. Solid, right? 17. So, like, the Israelites who were there, they celebrated the passover and this thing called the feast of unleavened bread for, like, a whole week. Found = present, just Hebrew lingo, ya know. 18. And let me tell you, there had never been a Passover celebration like the one that went down in Israel since the time of Samuel the prophet. Seriously, no king of Israel had ever thrown a Passover like Josiah did, with all the priests, Levites, and everyone from Judah and Israel who showed up, along with the people of Jerusalem. It was lit, fam! (BTW, 'present' means 'found' in Hebrew, just so you know.) 19. So like, in the year when Josiah was ruling for the eighteenth time, they celebrated this big feast called Passover and stuff. 20. So, like, once Josiah finished fixing up the temple, this dude Necho, the king of Egypt, he rolls up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates River. And guess what? Josiah ain't afraid, man! He goes out to face him head-on like a boss. 21. But he like, sent messengers to him and was like, 'What's my beef with you, yo, the king of Judah? Like, I ain't even attacking you today, but the house that I'm at war with. God told me to hurry up and get this done, so don't mess with Him, 'cause He's on my side and will wreck you. So just back off and don't start no fights with the guy who's got God backing him.' 22. But Josiah wasn't going to back down, even though he tried to hide his identity and wanted to fight against him. He ignored what Necho said, claiming it was from God, and went to battle in the valley of Megiddo. 23. So these archers took aim at King Josiah, and he shouted to his peeps: 'Get me outta here, yo! I'm totally hurtin'!' (Translation note: 'hurtin' here means 'sore wounded' in Hebrew) 24. So they moved him from his fancy ride to another fancy ride he had. They took him to Jerusalem and that's where he kicked the bucket and got buried in the same place as his ancestors. Everyone in Judah and Jerusalem was totally devastated about Josiah's death. 25. Jeremiah was so, so sad about Josiah. Like, seriously, he was devastated. And all the singers, especially the guys and the girls with great voices, they talked about Josiah in their sad songs. This went on for like, forever, and became a tradition in Israel. And guess what? It's all written down in those sad songs, or as we call them, the lamentations. 26. So, like, there were other things that Josiah did, and man, he was such a good dude, just like it says in the Lord's law, ya know? It talks about all the acts of kindness he showed, it's pretty rad! 27. Check it out, all the awesome things he did, from start to finish, are totally documented in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 351. Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem: and they killed the passover on the fourteenth {day} of the first month. 2. And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them to the service of the house of the LORD, 3. And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; {it shall} not {be} a burden upon {your} shoulders: serve now the LORD your God, and his people Israel, 4. And prepare {yourselves} by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son. 5. And stand in the holy {place} according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and {after} the division of the families of the Levites. {the families of the fathers: Heb. the house of the fathers} {the people: Heb. the sons of the people} 6. So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare your brethren, that {they} may do according to the word of the LORD by the hand of Moses. 7. And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks: these {were} of the king's substance. {gave: Heb. offered} 8. And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred {small cattle}, and three hundred oxen. {gave willingly: Heb. offered, etc} 9. Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand {small cattle}, and five hundred oxen. {gave: Heb. offered} 10. So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the king's commandment. 11. And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled {the blood} from their hands, and the Levites flayed {them}. 12. And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, to offer unto the LORD, as {it is} written in the book of Moses. And so {did they} with the oxen. 13. And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance: but the {other} holy {offerings} sod they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and divided {them} speedily among all the people. {divided...: Heb. made them run} 14. And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron {were busied} in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron. 15. And the singers the sons of Asaph {were} in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters {waited} at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them. {place: Heb. station} 16. So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah. 17. And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days. {present: Heb. found} 18. And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. {present: Heb. found} 19. In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this passover kept. 20. After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho king of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him. {temple: Heb. house} 21. But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? {I come} not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from {meddling with} God, who {is} with me, that he destroy thee not. {the house...: Heb. the house of my war} 22. Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo. 23. And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded. {wounded: Heb. made sick} 24. His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in {one of} the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. {in one...: or, among the sepulchres} 25. And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they {are} written in the lamentations. 26. Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness, according to {that which was} written in the law of the LORD, {goodness: Heb. kindnesses} 27. And his deeds, first and last, behold, they {are} written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. \n",
      "Gen Z: 2 Chronicles 361. So, like, the locals decided to make Jehoahaz, Josiah's son, the new king of Jerusalem instead of his dad. 2. Jehoahaz was just 23 years old when he started being the boss, and he ruled over Jerusalem for, like, three months. 3. So, the king of Egypt was like, 'Nah, you're outta here!' and made him leave Jerusalem. Oh, and he also made them pay a crazy amount of money: 100 talents of silver and a talent of gold. Like, majorly condemned the whole land. Can you even imagine? 4. So, the king of Egypt decided to make Eliakim, who was his brother, the king of Judah and Jerusalem. Oh, and he even changed his name to Jehoiakim! Meanwhile, Necho, a total boss, took Jehoahaz, his own brother, and brought him all the way to Egypt. Talk about some serious family drama! 5. So Jehoiakim was, like, 25 years old when he became king and ruled over Jerusalem for 11 years. But, dang, he did a lot of bad stuff that really didn't sit well with the Big Guy upstairs, aka the LORD his God. 6. So, like, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, totally showed up and put this guy in chains to take him back to Babylon. (Chains, like, as in handcuffs and stuff.) 7. Nebuchadnezzar straight up took some holy stuff from the LORD's crib and put it in his own temple in Babylon. 8. Yo, there's more juicy stuff about Jehoiakim, all the messed up stuff he did, and the tea about him can be found in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. After him, his son Jehoiachin took over. PS: Jehoiachin is also known as Jeconiah or Coniah. 9. Jehoiachin was only eight when he became king, and he ruled Jerusalem for three months and ten days. But, like, he totally messed up and did some seriously bad stuff that the LORD was not cool with. 10. And once the year was up, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon, along with all the fancy stuff from the house of the LORD. Then he made Zedekiah, his bro, the king of Judah and Jerusalem. Zedekiah's real name was Mattaniah and he was like Nebuchadnezzar's uncle or something. 11. Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king and ruled over Jerusalem for 11 years. 12. And he straight up did some messed up stuff that totally disappointed the LORD his God. Like, he didn't even have the decency to show respect to Jeremiah the prophet when he was speaking God's words. 13. And he totally went against King Nebuchadnezzar, who made him swear by God: but he was like, 'Nah, not gonna do it,' and stayed stubborn, refusing to turn back to the LORD God of Israel. 14. And like, the high priests and everyone, they totally messed up and did a ton of messed up stuff just like all those non-believers, and they totally disrespected the Lord's holy house in Jerusalem. 15. And the OG God of their fams straight up hit them up with his messengers, like always being on top of it and sending out the messages; 'cause he straight up felt for his peeps and his crib, you feel me? 16. But like, they totally made fun of God's messengers and like, didn't take His words seriously, and straight up disrespected His prophets. And then, boom, the LORD got super mad and was like, 'Enough is enough!' and there was, like, no way to fix things anymore. 17. And so, because they messed up big time, God let the king of the Chaldees come and wreck havoc in their holy place. He straight up killed all their young guys with his sword, showing zero mercy to anyone - whether they were dudes or girls, old folks or even the elderly. He basically handed all of them over to the king's control. 18. And, like, all the cool stuff from the house of God, from big things to small things, and all the super valuable stuff from the house of the LORD, plus the super fancy stuff from the king and his crew - he took all that and brought it to Babylon. 19. And they straight up set the house of God on fire, and completely wrecked the wall of Jerusalem. They burned down all the palaces there, and trashed all the fancy stuff inside. 20. And those who survived the sword were taken to Babylon and became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of Persia took over. (Surprising, right? They were the leftovers from the whole sword thing.) 21. To make sure what the LORD said through Jeremiah came true, until the land had a good break: while it stayed all empty and barren, it took a chill pill and rested, just like, for a whole seventy years. 22. So, like, in the beginning of Cyrus's reign as king of Persia, the LORD totally fulfilled what He told Jeremiah. The LORD totally influenced Cyrus, giving him this rad idea to make a huge announcement all over his kingdom, and even write it down, saying, 23. Yo, listen up! This is what Cyrus, the boss of Persia, has to say: The Almighty God of heaven has graced me with all the kingdoms of the earth. He gave me a special mission to build a house for Him in Jerusalem, y'know, in Judah. So, anyone from His chosen peeps out there? May the Lord, his God, be with that person and let 'em go up! \n",
      "KJV: 2 Chronicles 361. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem. 2. Jehoahaz {was} twenty and three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. 3. And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold. {put...: Heb. removed him} 4. And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt. 5. Jehoiakim {was} twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD his God. 6. Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon. {fetters: or, chains} 7. Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon. 8. Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they {are} written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead. {Jehoiachin: also called, Jeconiah, or, Coniah} 9. Jehoiachin {was} eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD. 10. And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem. {when...: Heb. at the return of the year} {goodly...: Heb. vessels of desire} {Zedekiah...: or, Mattaniah, his father's brother} 11. Zedekiah {was} one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. 12. And he did {that which was} evil in the sight of the LORD his God, {and} humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet {speaking} from the mouth of the LORD. 13. And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel. 14. Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem. 15. And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place: {by: Heb. by the hand of} {betimes: that is, continually and carefully} 16. But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till {there was} no remedy. {remedy: Heb. healing} 17. Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age: he gave {them} all into his hand. 18. And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king, and of his princes; all {these} he brought to Babylon. 19. And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof. 20. And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia: {them...: Heb. the remainder from the sword} 21. To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: {for} as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years. 22. Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD {spoken} by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and {put it} also in writing, saying, 23. Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me to build him an house in Jerusalem, which {is} in Judah. Who {is there} among you of all his people? The LORD his God {be} with him, and let him go up. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ezra 11. So, like, in the beginning of Cyrus' reign as king of Persia, this epic prophecy from the LORD spoken by Jeremiah was totally about to go down. The LORD, like, totally inspired Cyrus and got him hyped up to make this huge announcement all over his kingdom. And then, he didn't just say it, he even wrote it down, like, for everyone to see and stuff. It was wild! 2. Yo, listen up! Cyrus, the king of Persia, got a message from the LORD God up there in heaven. He straight up blessed him with all the kingdoms on earth and gave him this important mission to build a house for Him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Juicy stuff! 3. Yo, anyone from his squad wanna join? If so, may his God be with him and let him head to Jerusalem, yo! It's in Judah, BTW. We gotta build the house of the LORD God of Israel, like, he's legit, you know? And his HQ is in Jerusalem, FYI. 4. And if anyone stays in a certain location for a while, the guys around him should totally help him out with cash, bling, cool stuff, and even some animals too, along with a voluntary donation for God's crib in Jerusalem. #LiftHimUp 5. So, the leaders of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and the Levites, and all those who were motivated by God's Spirit, came together to start building the house of the LORD in Jerusalem. 6. And all the people who were around them showed their support by giving them silver, gold, valuable items, and even livestock. They gladly offered all these things to help them. 7. So like, this dude Cyrus, the king, like took all the stuff from the house of the LORD that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and put it in his own gods' house, you know. 8. Cyrus, the king of Persia, brought them all out with the help of Mithredath the treasurer and counted them in front of Sheshbazzar, the ruler of Judah. 9. So, like, there were like 30 flashy gold chargers, a freaking 1000 shiny silver chargers, and like 29 super sharp knives, ya know? 10. Like, there were 30 golden bowls, ya know? And, like, 410 silver bowls of a different kind? Plus, like, a thousand other fancy things! 11. Sheshbazzar straight up brought like, 5400 gold and silver things all the way from Babylon to Jerusalem when the people were getting transported out of there. \n",
      "KJV: Ezra 11. Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and {put it} also in writing, saying, {made...: Heb. caused a voice to pass} 2. Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at Jerusalem, which {is} in Judah. 3. Who {is there} among you of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which {is} in Judah, and build the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he {is} the God,) which {is} in Jerusalem. 4. And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that {is} in Jerusalem. {help...: Heb. lift him up} 5. Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, with all {them} whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which {is} in Jerusalem. 6. And all they that {were} about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, beside all {that} was willingly offered. {strengthened...: that is, helped them} 7. Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods; 8. Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. 9. And this {is} the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, 10. Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second {sort} four hundred and ten, {and} other vessels a thousand. 11. All the vessels of gold and of silver {were} five thousand and four hundred. All {these} did Sheshbazzar bring up with {them of} the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem. {the captivity: Heb. the transportation} \n",
      "Gen Z: Ezra 21. So, these are the kids from the province who made it out of captivity, who were taken away by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and brought back to Jerusalem and Judah, each one to their own city. 2.

Pashur's kids, 1,247 of 'em. 39. The Harim fam has, like, a huge crew of one thousand and seventeen kids. No cap. 40. The Levites: the fam of Jeshua and Kadmiel, from the fam of Hodaviah, 74 in total. {Hodaviah: also known as Judah or Hodevah} 41. The artists: the squad of Asaph, a whopping 128 of 'em. 42. The squad of gatekeepers: Shallum's crew, Ater's crew, Talmon's crew, Akkub's crew, Hatita's crew, Shobai's crew, 139 strong. 43. The Nethinims: Ziha squad, Hasupha gang, Tabbaoth crew, 44.

There were a total of 392 Nethinims and children of Solomon's servants. 59. So these were the people who came from Telmelah, Telharsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer. But they couldn't prove their family background and whether they were true Israelites. Addan was also known as Addon, and 'seed' refers to their lineage. 60. Delaiah had some kids, Tobiah had some kids, Nekoda also had some kids, a grand total of six hundred and fifty-two offspring! 61. And the offspring of the priests included Habaiah, Koz, and Barzillai, who married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and took on their family name. 62. These guys were looking for their name on the family tree, but couldn't find it anywhere. So, they got kicked out of the priesthood like a total disgrace. 63. So the big boss told them not to chow down on the super sacred stuff until a priest stepped up with their special guide. 64. There were like, 42,300 peeps in the whole crew, if we're being specific. 65. In addition to their squad of helpers, which numbered to a whopping 7,337, they had a legit crew of 200 singers consisting of both dudes and chicks. 66. They had, like, 736 horses and 245 mules, ngl. 67. They had, like, 435 camels and, like, 6,720 donkeys. 68. And then a few of the elders, when they arrived at the house of the LORD in Jerusalem, generously donated towards building the house of God and setting it up in its rightful spot: 69. They flexed their skills and contributed to the treasure of the project with a whopping 61k grams of gold, 5k pounds of silver, and 100 lit priests' outfits. 70. So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities. \n",

They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments. 70. So the priests, and the Levites, and {some} of the people, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ezra 31. So, like, when it was the seventh month and all the Israelites were chillin' in their cities, they all came together as a united squad and headed to Jerusalem, you know? 2. So Jeshua, son of Jozadak, along with his fellow priests, and Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and his crew, got up and built the altar for the God of Israel. They wanted to offer burnt sacrifices there, just like it says in the law of Moses, that cool dude who was close to God. (By the way, Jeshua is also known as Joshua, and Zerubbabel is sometimes called Zorobabel, and Shealtiel goes by Salathiel in Greek.) 3. So they placed the altar on its foundations; they were afraid of the people from those countries. And they made burnt offerings to the LORD on it, both in the morning and in the evening. 4. They celebrated the festival of tabernacles, just like it was written, and offered the daily burnt offerings according to the usual custom, as was required every day; following the routine for each specific day. 5. And then they did the regular burnt offering, like, every time there was a new moon or a special festival that the LORD said to do. And also, anyone who was super down, they could totally trustingly give an offering out of their own free will to the LORD. 6. On the very first day of the seventh month, they started making burnt offerings to the LORD. But they hadn't even laid the foundation for the LORD's temple yet. 7. They gave some cash to the builders and the craftsmen, as well as food, drinks, and oil, to those from Zidon and Tyre. All this was to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, just as we got permission from Cyrus, the king of Persia. {carpenters: or, workmen} 8. So, like, it was the second year after they all showed up at the house of God in Jerusalem. It was the second month when Zerubbabel, Shealtiel's son, Jeshua, Jozadak's son, and the rest of their crew - the priests, the Levites, and all those who came back from captivity to Jerusalem - got together. They decided to assign the Levites, who were at least twenty years old, to start working on the house of the LORD. 9. So, Jeshua and his fam, including Kadmiel and his fam, the fam of Judah, joined up to lead the workers at God's crib. Plus, the Henadad fam and their squads, the Levites. (P.S. Judah is also called Hodaviah. They all came together as one gang.) 10. So, like, when the builders started putting down the base for the temple of the LORD, they had the priests rocking their lit outfits with trumpets, and the Levites (the sons of Asaph) jamming on their cymbals to show some major love for the LORD, following the rules set by King David of Israel. 11. They all sang and vibed together, praising and showing gratitude to the LORD, 'cause He's awesome and His love for Israel lasts forever. And yo, all the people shouted and made a major hype when they praised the LORD, 'cause they just laid down the foundation for His house. 12. But a bunch of priests, Levites, and OG dads who had seen the old house being built, witnessed the foundation of this new house and started crying like crazy. Meanwhile, others were straight up shouting with pure happiness! 13. So basically, the people were so hype that you couldn't even tell if they were screaming with happiness or crying. They were straight up shouting like crazy and the sound traveled far and wide. \n",
      "KJV: Ezra 31. And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel {were} in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man to Jerusalem. 2. Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as {it is} written in the law of Moses the man of God. {Jeshua: also called, Joshua} {Zerubbabel: Gr. Zorobabel} {Shealtiel: Gr. Salathiel} 3. And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear {was} upon them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, {even} burnt offerings morning and evening. 4. They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as {it is} written, and {offered} the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the custom, as the duty of every day required; {as the duty...: Heb. the matter of the day in his day} 5. And afterward {offered} the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD. 6. From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not {yet} laid. {the foundation...: Heb. the temple of the LORD was not yet founded} 7. They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of Persia. {carpenters: or, workmen} 8. Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the LORD. 9. Then stood Jeshua {with} his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, {with} their sons and their brethren the Levites. {Judah: also called, Hodaviah} {together: Heb. as one} 10. And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel. 11. And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because {he is} good, for his mercy {endureth} for ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. 12. But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, {who were} ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy: 13. So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ezra 41. So, like, when the haters of Judah and Benjamin found out that the kids who were taken away built the temple for the LORD God of Israel, you know? 2. So they went to Zerubbabel and the head of the parents' group and said to them, 'Hey, let's join forces and help you build! We're also into your God, just like you are, and we've been making sacrifices to Him since the days of Esarhaddon, the king of Assur, who brought us here.' 3. But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other top leaders of Israel were like, 'Yo, you guys can't help us build a house for our God. We got this! We're gonna build it ourselves for the LORD God of Israel, just like King Cyrus of Persia ordered us to.' 4. So basically, the locals started causing trouble for the people of Judah and messed with their building plans. 5. So they got advisors to go against them and mess up their plans throughout the entire time Cyrus, the king of Persia, ruled, until Darius, another king of Persia, took over. 6. And when Ahasuerus started being in charge, some people sent him a complaint about the peeps living in Judah and Jerusalem. (FYI, Ahasuerus is another word for Ahashverosh) 7. So back in the days of Artaxerxes, there were some guys named Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and their crew. They decided to write a letter to Artaxerxes, the king of Persia. Now, this letter was written in the Syrian language, and then translated into the Syrian language again. Just some interesting tidbits: Bishlam's name means 'in peace' and the word 'companions' could also mean 'societies' in Hebrew. 8. So like, Rehum and Shimshai, they were the ones who wrote this letter, right? And they were all against Jerusalem, and they sent it to King Artaxerxes. It went something like this, you know: 9. So Rehum, the chancellor, and Shimshai, the scribe, along with their crew, the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites (Chaldean homies too), all came together and wrote a letter. 10. Then there were these other nations that were brought by the cool and awesome Asnappar to live in the cities of Samaria and other places on this side of the river, all happening at a specific time. (Chaldee, Cheeneth) 11. So here's the deal, this is the exact copy of the letter they sent to Artaxerxes, the king. It's from your boys on this side of the river, at a specific time. 12. Yo, just so you know, King, those Jews who migrated from your place to ours have arrived in Jerusalem. They're busy constructing that rebellious and not-so-great city, and they've managed to finish building its walls and connecting the foundations. 13. Yo, king, listen up. If they rebuild this city and put up the walls, they ain't gonna pay no tolls, taxes, or fees. That means it will hurt the king's money flow. Just saying. 14. So, because we're getting support from the palace and it would be totally uncool for us to witness any disrespect towards the king, we decided to send a message to let the king know. You know, we've got that palace vibe in us. 15. Like, check the archives of your ancestors, you'll totally find in the ancient records that this city is, like, super rebellious and causes trouble for kings and provinces. They've been stirring up trouble since forever, which is, like, why the city got wrecked. Just saying. 16. Yo, just so you know, if they rebuild this city and put up its walls, you won't have any part of it on this side of the river. 17. The king hit up Rehum, the big shot, and Shimshai, the writer, and their crew in Samaria, and everyone else across the river with a chill message: Peace, and let's link up soon. 🕊️ 18. I just finished reading the letter you sent us, no frills. 19. So, like, I ordered an investigation, and they found out that this city has, like, a history of rebelling against kings and causing all sorts of chaos and disruption. It's, like, known for being a total troublemaker, you know? 20. Yo, there were some seriously powerful kings in charge of Jerusalem, and they had control over all the regions across the river. These kings were getting paid mad cash in the form of tolls, tribute, and taxes. 21. Yo, tell them to stop right now and not continue building this city until I give them another command. Like, make it a decree and stuff. 22. Yo, make sure you don't slack off on this, alright? We don't want things to get messed up and cause trouble for the kings, you feel me? 23. So, like, when Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their crew read the letter from king Artaxerxes, they freaked out and rushed to Jerusalem to stop the Jews forcefully, using their power and all. The whole arm and power thing, you know! 24. The construction of God's crib in Jerusalem stopped. It didn't continue until the second year of Darius, the Persian ruler. \n",
      "KJV: Ezra 41. Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel; {the children...: Heb. the sons of the transportation} 2. Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye {do}; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither. 3. But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. 4. Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building, 5. And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. 6. And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they {unto him} an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. {Ahasuerus: Heb. Ahashverosh} 7. And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of the letter {was} written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue. {Bishlam: or, in peace} {companions: Heb. societies} 8. Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: {scribe: or, secretary} 9. Then {wrote} Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, {and} the Elamites, {companions: Chaldee, societies} 10. And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest {that are} on this side the river, and at such a time. {at such...: Chaldee, Cheeneth} 11. This {is} the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, {even} unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the river, and at such a time. 12. Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have set up the walls {thereof}, and joined the foundations. {set up: or, finished} {joined: Chaldee, sewed together} 13. Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the walls set up {again, then} will they not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and {so} thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings. {pay: Chaldee, give} {revenue: or, strength} 14. Now because we have maintenance from {the king's} palace, and it was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore have we sent and certified the king; {we have...: Chaldee, we are salted with the salt of the palace} 15. That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city {is} a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed. {moved: Chaldee, made} {within...: Chaldee, in the midst thereof} 16. We certify the king that, if this city be builded {again}, and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river. 17. {Then} sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and {to} Shimshai the scribe, and {to} the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria, and {unto} the rest beyond the river, Peace, and at such a time. {companions: Chaldee, societies} 18. The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. 19. And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and {that} rebellion and sedition have been made therein. {I commanded: Chaldee, by me a decree is set} {made insurrection: Chaldee, lifted up itself} 20. There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all {countries} beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them. 21. Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city be not builded, until {another} commandment shall be given from me. {Give...: Chaldee, Make a decree} 22. Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings? 23. Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter {was} read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. {by force...: Chaldee, by arm and power} 24. Then ceased the work of the house of God which {is} at Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ezra 51. So, like, the prophets Haggai and Zechariah were all up in the Jews' faces, you know, the ones chilling in Judah and Jerusalem. They were preaching in the name of the God of Israel, giving them some spiritual wisdom and stuff. 2. Zerubbabel, Shealtiel's kiddo, and Jeshua, Jozadak's offspring, stepped up and kicked off the construction of God's crib, right here in Jerusalem. And they had the prophets of God by their side, lending a hand. 3. So, like, Tatnai, the governor of this area, and Shetharboznai, and their crew showed up, and they were all like, 'Who told you guys to build this crib and put up this wall?' 4. So we were like, yo, who are the dudes responsible for putting up this sick building? Like, what's their squad name? Word is they're Chaldeans, master builders and all that. 5. But God was watching over the elders of the Jews, making sure that nobody could stop them until the whole thing went to Darius. And that's when they sent a letter to explain what was going on. 6. So there's this letter that Tatnai, the governor dude, and Shetharboznai, and their crew, the Apharsachites, who were all on this side of the river, sent to King Darius: 7. They hit him up with a letter that went like: 'Yo, Darius the king, peace out, my dude.' 8. Yo, just a heads up for the king, we totally made our way to the province of Judea, to the crib of the almighty God. And let me tell you, that place is legit! They got massive stones for the walls and they're even adding some sick timber. The construction is moving mad fast and they're killing it. No doubt, everything's going super well for them. 9. So we went to those old heads and straight up asked them, like, who told you to build this crib and put up these walls? 10. We were like, 'Yo, what's your names tho? Just so we can make sure and write down the names of the homies who were leading them. 11. And they responded, saying, We're like, totally the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we're working on this super awesome house that was built ages ago by this major king of Israel. It's all legit, fam! 12. Yo, listen up. So, our ancestors seriously ticked off the big man upstairs and He got super pissed. He ended up letting this dude named Nebuchadnezzar, the ruler of Babylon, lay the smackdown on them. And not only did he wreck their crib, but he also straight up kidnapped our people and took them to Babylon. 13. So, like, in the first year when Cyrus was ruling Babylon, he was all like, 'Yo, let's build God's crib, fam.' 14. So, like, Nebuchadnezzar straight up took all the fancy gold and silver stuff from God's house in Jerusalem and brought it to Babylon. But then Cyrus, the king, snatched those goodies from the Babylon temple and handed them over to this dude named Sheshbazzar, who he made governor. Pretty impressive, huh? 15. Yo, He's like, 'Yo, grab these things, go and bring them to the temple in Jerusalem, and get the house of God built up in that spot, ya feel? 16. So like, Sheshbazzar showed up and started building the house of God in Jerusalem. And yo, it's been under construction since then, like till now and still not totally done. 17. So, like, if the king is cool with it, we should totally check out his treasure stash in Babylon. We need to find out if it's true that King Cyrus made a decree to build God's house in Jerusalem. And then the king can hit us up with his thoughts on this. \n",
      "KJV: Ezra 51. Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that {were} in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, {even} unto them. 2. Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which {is} at Jerusalem: and with them {were} the prophets of God helping them. 3. At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall? 4. Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men that make this building? {make: Chaldee, build} 5. But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning this {matter}. 6. The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which {were} on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: 7. They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the king, all peace. {wherein: Chaldee, in the midst whereof} 8. Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands. {great...: Chaldee, stones of rolling} 9. Then asked we those elders, {and} said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls? 10. We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the names of the men that {were} the chief of them. 11. And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up. 12. But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. 13. But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon {the same} king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God. 14. And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that {was} in Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto {one}, whose name {was} Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; {governor: or, deputy} 15. And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that {is} in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his place. 16. Then came the same Sheshbazzar, {and} laid the foundation of the house of God which {is} in Jerusalem: and since that time even until now hath it been in building, and {yet} it is not finished. 17. Now therefore, if {it seem} good to the king, let there be search made in the king's treasure house, which {is} there at Babylon, whether it be {so}, that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ezra 61. So, King Darius dropped a new rule and they went on a search in the ancient Babylonian library, where all the cool stuff was kept. {rolls: Chaldee, books} {laid up: Chaldee, made to descend} 2. So, like, they found this scroll in Achmetha, you know, that fancy palace in the province of the Medes. And guess what? It had a record written on it, like, really old-school style. Achmetha, by the way, is also known as Ecbatana, or it was in a coffer or something. 3. In the lit year of Cyrus the king (yes, that Cyrus), he straight up made a sick proclamation about rebuilding God's crib in Jerusalem. Let's get this house party started - the spot where they used to make sacrifices - and make sure the foundations are legit solid. We're talking sixty cubits high and wide, no cap. 4. We need three sick rows of big flexin' stones, and one row of fresh timber. And yo, make sure the king's crib covers the expenses, you feel me? 5. Oh, and don't forget to give back those cool gold and silver stuff from God's crib that Nebuchadnezzar swiped and brought over to Babylon. Take 'em back to the temple in Jerusalem and put each item back where it belongs, back in God's house. Got it? 6. So, like, Tatnai and Shetharboznai, you and your crew of Apharsachites, who are like, on the other side of the river, peeps, you better back off real quick. Don't even think about coming near that place, 'cause it's off-limits, ya feel me? And I'm not just talking about on a physical level, but also on a spiritual level, bro. So, yeah, keep your distance, my dudes. Oh, and by the way, I'm speaking this message in the language of Chaldee, just so you know what's up with their culture and stuff, ya know? 7. Yo, chill with messing with this crib of God. Let the boss of the Jews and the OGs of the Jews do their thing and build this holy pad for God in peace. 8. Yo, listen up! I've got an important announcement regarding the OG Jews and their project of building God's crib. Check it: I decree that these homies should be provided with cash money from the king's stash, specifically from the taxes collected across the river. No delays allowed, we need to support their hustle and make sure nothing gets in their way. Like, no obstacles, man. This decree is legit, signed by yours truly. 9. And they should provide whatever is necessary - like, young bullocks, rams, and lambs - for the sweet offerings to the God of the heavens. Also, don't forget to give them wheat, salt, wine, and oil, just as the priests in Jerusalem have instructed. It's gotta be given to them daily, no exceptions! 10. So they can make some lit offerings to the Heavenly God, and also pray for the king's life and his fam. {of sweet...: Chaldee, of rest} 11. I've made a rule, okay? If anyone even thinks about changing this word, their house will be torn down and they'll be hung on the timber. And to top it off, their house will become a disgusting mess. 12. And the God who has picked this place as His home will destroy any kings or people who try to mess with or ruin this awesome house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, am making it official - get it done ASAP! 13. So, like, Tatnai, the governor dude, and Shetharboznai, and their crew, they followed what King Darius had ordered and got things done fast! 14. So, the wise OGs of the Jews came together, and with the lit words of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo, they went all in and built. They hustled hard and completed the project, just like the God of Israel and Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, the kings of Persia commanded them. It was a big deal, like a solid decree. 15. And this crib got done like, bam, on the third day of the month Adar, smack in the middle of Darius the king's sixth year on the throne. 16. So, like, the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, and the other peeps who were brought here as captives, they totally celebrated the dedication of God's house with heaps of joy, ya know? 17. And they went all out with the housewarming party at this lit crib of God. They brought a hundred beefy bullocks, two hundred fierce rams, and four hundred fluffy lambs. Plus, to make things right for the whole squad of Israel, they threw in twelve badass he-goats, one for each tribe. Talk about turning up! 18. So they organized the priests into their groups, and the Levites into their squads, to do the work of God in Jerusalem, just as it was written in the book of Moses. 19. And the kids who were taken away celebrated Passover on the 14th day of the first month. 20. The priests and Levites were totally clean after the purification process. They came together and slaughtered the passover animal for all the children held captive, their fellow priests, and themselves. 21. The Israelite squad, who bounced back from captivity, and all those who had chosen to distance themselves from the nasty habits of the foreign peeps in the land, all gathered to feast in honor of the one and only LORD God of Israel. 22. And they had this lit celebration called 'Unleavened Bread Week' where they partied for a whole week. It was so fire because God had blessed them with happiness and even made the king of Assyria support them and help them with their work in building the house of God, who's the real deal for Israel. \n",
      "KJV: Ezra 61. Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. {rolls: Chaldee, books} {laid up: Chaldee, made to descend} 2. And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that {is} in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein {was} a record thus written: {Achmetha: or, Ecbatana, or, in a coffer} 3. In the first year of Cyrus the king {the same} Cyrus the king made a decree {concerning} the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, {and} the breadth thereof threescore cubits; 4. {With} three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house: 5. And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which {is} at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which {is} at Jerusalem, {every one} to his place, and place {them} in the house of God. {brought again: Chaldee, go} 6. Now {therefore}, Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which {are} beyond the river, be ye far from thence: {your...: Chaldee, their societies} 7. Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place. 8. Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, {even} of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered. {I make...: Chaldee, by me a decree is made} {hindered: Chaldee, made to cease} 9. And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which {are} at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: 10. That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. {of sweet...: Chaldee, of rest} 11. Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. {let him...: Chaldee, let him be destroyed} 12. And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter {and} to destroy this house of God which {is} at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed. 13. Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily. 14. And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished {it}, according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. {commandment: Chaldee, decree} 15. And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king. 16. And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy, {the children of the captivity: Chaldee, the sons of the transportation} 17. And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 18. And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which {is} at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses. {as it is...: Chaldee, according to the writing} 19. And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth {day} of the first month. 20. For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them {were} pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. 21. And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat, 22. And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ezra 71. So, like, this all happened during the time when Artaxerxes was, like, the boss king of Persia. And Ezra, he was the son of Seraiah, who was the son of Azariah, who was the son of Hilkiah. Pretty cool, right? 2. Shallum's kid, Zadok's kid, Ahitub's kid, 3. So like, Amariah's kid, Azariah's kid, and Meraioth's kid, 4. Zerahiah's kid, Uzzi's grandson, Bukki's great-grandson, 5. Abishua's kid, Phinehas' grandkid, Eleazar's great-grandkid, Aaron's OG high priest: 6. So, this dude named Ezra left Babylon and he was super skilled at writing down and understanding all the laws that Moses gave us. The LORD God of Israel was the one who gave those laws, by the way. And get this, the king totally approved of Ezra and gave him everything he asked for! That's because the LORD his God had his back big time! 7. So, like, this group of peeps from Israel, along with the priests, Levites, singers, porters, and Nethinims, they all headed to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes. 8. And he rolled up in Jerusalem on the fifth month, around the seventh year of the king. 9. So on the first day of the first month, he started his journey from Babylon and arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month. This was all because his God was watching over him and making things happen. (The first day of the first month marked the beginning of his journey, just so you know.) 10. Ezra was totally ready to search for God's law, live it out, and educate peeps in Israel about the rules and decisions. 11. So, like, here's the letter King Artaxerxes sent to Ezra, the priest and super smart scribe who wrote down all the important stuff God said and the rules He gave to Israel. 12. Yo, Artaxerxes, the ultimate ruler, hollerin' at Ezra the priest, a dope writer who knows all about the laws of the God up above, hope you're chillin' in complete peace. And this is goin' down at the perfect timing. 13. Yo, listen up! I'm putting it out there that any Israelites, priests, or Levites in my kingdom who are feeling it in their hearts to head over to Jerusalem can roll with you, no questions asked. 14. Since you've been assigned by the king and his council of seven to investigate Judah and Jerusalem, according to the laws of your God that you have in your possession; as per the king's requirement. 15. And to transport the sick bling, made of silver and gold, that the king and his squad generously donated to the big man upstairs, the God of Israel, who's kicking it in Jerusalem, 16. And yo, grab all the sick silver and gold you can find in the whole province of Babylon, plus the generous offerings from the people and the priests who are down to contribute, all willingly, for the crib of their God in Jerusalem: 17. So you can flex real quick with all this cash and cop some dope bullocks, rams, and lambs, along with their fire food and drinks. Then you can go ahead and sacrifice them on the altar at your God's crib in Jerusalem. 18. So, like, whatever you and your squad think is cool to do with the rest of the cash money, just make sure it aligns with what your higher power wants, ya know? 19. Don't forget to bring all those cool stuff that are meant for serving in God's crib, and hand 'em over to the big man upstairs in Jerusalem! 20. And whatever else you need to provide for the house of your God, feel free to use the king's treasure house for that. 21. Yo, it's ya boy Artaxerxes the king, and I'm here to drop a mad decree for all the treasurers out there, y'know? Basically, my main man Ezra, the priest and scribe of the divine law from the big man upstairs, he's got some requests for y'all. And let me tell ya, whatever he needs, y'all better make it happen ASAP, no questions asked! 22. I'll hook you up with a sick amount of cash, like a hundred stacks of silver. And not just that, I got you covered with a hundred loads of wheat, a hundred barrels of wine, a hundred barrels of oil, and unlimited salt, no cap. (measures: Chaldee, cors) 23. Yo, whatever the God of heaven commands, make sure you do it with mad dedication for the house of the God of heaven. Like, we don't want any wrath coming down on the king and his sons, you feel? 24. Yo, listen up! We gotta let you know that when it comes to the priests, Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, and all those who serve in God's house, it's totally illegal to make them pay any taxes, fees, or customs, okay? 25. Yo, Ezra, use your God-given wisdom to appoint leaders and judges who can uphold the laws of God. Their job is to judge all the people who live on the other side of the river, specifically those who already know God's laws. And, don't forget to teach those who don't know 'em yet. 26. So, anyone who refuses to follow the laws of your God and the laws of the king better face the consequences real quick. They could end up facing death, getting banished, losing all their stuff, or even getting thrown in jail. (Just so you know, 'to banishment' in Chaldee means getting completely uprooted.) 27. Praise the LORD God of our dads, who has inspired the king to make the house of the LORD in Jerusalem even cooler! 28. And God showed me kindness in front of the king, his advisors, and all the powerful people in the kingdom. I felt empowered because I knew that the Lord my God was with me, and I gathered important leaders from Israel to go with me. \n",
      "KJV: Ezra 71. Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 2.

The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest: 6. This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he {was} a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him. 7. And there went up {some} of the children of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. 8. And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which {was} in the seventh year of the king. 9. For upon the first {day} of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first {day} of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. {began...: Heb. was the foundation of the going up} 10. For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do {it}, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments. 11. Now this {is} the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, {even} a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel. 12. Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect {peace}, and at such a time. {unto...: or, to Ezra the priest, a perfect scribe of the law of the God of heaven, peace, etc} 13. I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and {of} his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee. 14.

And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation {is} in Jerusalem, 16. And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which {is} in Jerusalem: 17. That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which {is} in Jerusalem. 18. And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God. 19. The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, {those} deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. 20. And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow {it} out of the king's treasure house. 21. And I, {even} I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the treasurers which {are} beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily, 22. Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing {how much}. {measures: Chaldee, cors} 23. Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons? {Whatsoever...: Chaldee, Whatsoever is of the decree} 24. Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them. 25. And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that {is} in thine hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that {are} beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye them that know {them} not. 26. And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether {it be} unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment. {to banishment: Chaldee, to rooting out} 27. Blessed {be} the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put {such a thing} as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of the LORD which {is} in Jerusalem: 28. And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes.

      "Gen Z: Ezra 81. These are the top fam leaders and here's the family tree of the squad that rolled with me from Babylon when Artaxerxes was king. 2. Phinehas had a son named Gershom, Ithamar had a son named Daniel, and David had a son named Hattush. 3. Among the dudes from Shechaniah's crew, from the Pharosh squad, there was this dude named Zechariah. He was listed as one of the OGs in the family tree, with a total count of 150 of his homies. 4. Among the guys from Pahathmoab were Elihoenai, son of Zerahiah, and he rolled in with a squad of 200 homies. 5. Among Shechaniah's crew, there was Jahaziel's homie leading a squad of 300 bros. 6. Among Adin's kids, there was Ebed, Jonathan's son. He rolled deep with a team of fifty other dudes. 7. And among the dudes from Elam were Jeshaiah, the son of Athaliah, and he had like 70 homies with him. 8. And among the sons of Shephatiah was Zebadiah, who was bro of Michael, and they rolled deep with eighty dudes. 9. Among Joab's crew were Obadiah, Jehiel's son, rolling with a squad of 218 dudes. 10. And among the dudes from team Shelomith were Josiphiah, a legendary bro, who rolled with a squad of a hundred and sixty other dudes. 11. And among the dudes of Bebai, there was Zechariah, Bebai's own son. Plus, he had 28 homies rollin' with him. 12. And from the squad of Azgad, there was Johanan, a total bro, who brought along 110 dudes. (BTW, he was the youngest in the squad!) 13. And the last boys of Adonikam, their names are Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and they bring along sixty dudes with them. 🙌 14. Among the dudes from the Bigvai crew were Uthai, Zabbud, and a squad of seventy homies. (Or maybe Zabbud's name was actually Zaccur, according to some peeps.) 15. So, like, I gathered everyone near this cool river, you know, the one that flows towards Ahava? Anyway, we set up our tents and stayed there for like three days. As I looked around, I noticed that none of the dudes from the Levi tribe were there. It was kinda weird, you know? 😅 16. So I hit up Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam - all the top dogs. I also reached out to Joiarib and Elnathan, who are pretty wise, you know. 17. So, like, I gave them some instructions, you know? I was all like, 'Go find this Iddo guy in Casiphia, he's in charge and stuff.' And I told them what to say to him and his Nethinim buddies, also in Casiphia. I was like, 'We need some peeps to help out in our temple, so bring us some ministers, ya know?' 18. And thanks to God, they introduced us to a really wise dude from the Mahli crew, who was from the Levi fam, which is part of the Israel fam. Sherebiah and his squad, including his sons and bros, were also there, making it a total of eighteen people. 19. And Hashabiah, and his bro Jeshaiah from Merari's fam, along with their fam and kids, were a total of twenty; 20. In addition to that, there were 220 Nethinims who were selected by David and the leaders to assist the Levites. Each and every one of them was specifically named and recognized for their role. 21. So I was like, let's have a fasting sesh by the Ahava river, so we could humble ourselves before God and ask Him for guidance in finding the right path for us, our squad and everything we own. 22. I didn't want to ask the king for backup of soldiers and horsemen to fight off the enemy. We had told the king that God's got our backs if we seek Him, but He'll come down hard on anyone who abandons Him. 23. So, like, we were totally fasting and earnestly praying to our awesome God for this, and yo, He totally answered our prayers! 24. So, I picked twelve top priests - Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their buddies - and I set them apart for a special mission. 25. Then they checked out the cash, bling, and stuff that the peeps, including the king, his crew, and all of Israel, brought as an offering to God's crib. 26. I gave them about 650 talents of silver and 100 talents of silver vessels, and also 100 talents of gold. 27. I got twenty gold basons, each worth a thousand drams, and two super cool vessels made of fancy copper that's as precious as gold. (BTW, the copper is like shiny brass, and it's totally desirable!) 28. And I was like, yo, you guys are totally set apart for the Lord, y'know? Like, you're sacred, just like the cool utensils, and even the shiny silver and gold are like, gifts that you willingly give to the Lord, the God of your ancestors, bro. 29. Yo, stay woke and guard those things until you take them to the big shots like the high priests, Levites, and top dogs of Israel, in Jerusalem, at the sick crib of the Lord's crib. 30. So, like, the priests and the Levites, they took all the silver, gold, and cool stuff, and they brought it all to Jerusalem, to the house of our awesome God! 31. So, like, we left the Ahava River on the twelfth of the first month to head to Jerusalem. And, bro, the power of our God was totally with us, and He saved us from our enemies and anyone trying to ambush us on the way. 32. So, we rolled up in Jerusalem and stayed there for, like, three days. 33. So, like, on day four, they were weighing all the silver, gold, and fancy stuff in God's house. Meremoth, son of Uriah the priest, was in charge of it, with Eleazar, son of Phinehas, and Jozabad, son of Jeshua, and Noadiah, son of Binnui, who were all Levites and helping out. 34. It was all counted and weighed, and every weight was recorded back then. 35. The kids of the ones who were once taken away and came back from being stuck, they made some lit sacrifices to the God of Israel. It was a total flex - twelve big bullocks, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve he goats just for forgiveness vibes. All of that was offered up in flames to the LORD. 36. So they sent the king's orders to the king's squad leaders and the bosses on this side of the river. And they helped out the people and the house of God. \n",
      "KJV: Ezra 81. These {are} now the chief of their fathers, and {this is} the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king. 2. Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush. 3. Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty. 4. Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males. 5. Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males. 6. Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males. 7. And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males. 8. And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him fourscore males. 9. Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males. 10. And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an hundred and threescore males. 11. And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him twenty and eight males. 12. And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an hundred and ten males. {the son...: or, the youngest son} 13. And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names {are} these, Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males. 14. Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy males. {Zabbud: or, Zaccur, as some read} 15. And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi. {abode: or, pitched} 16. Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of understanding. 17. And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, {and} to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God. {I told...: Heb. I put words in their mouth} 18. And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; 19. And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty; 20. Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name. 21. Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance. 22. For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God {is} upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his wrath {is} against all them that forsake him. 23. So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us. 24. Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, 25. And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, {even} the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel {there} present, had offered: 26. I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, {and} of gold an hundred talents; 27. Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine copper, precious as gold. {fine...: Heb. yellow, or, shining brass} {precious: Heb. desirable} 28. And I said unto them, Ye {are} holy unto the LORD; the vessels {are} holy also; and the silver and the gold {are} a freewill offering unto the LORD God of your fathers. 29. Watch ye, and keep {them}, until ye weigh {them} before the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD. 30. So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, to bring {them} to Jerusalem unto the house of our God. 31. Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth {day} of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way. 32. And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days. 33. Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him {was} Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them {was} Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites; 34. By number {and} by weight of every one: and all the weight was written at that time. 35. {Also} the children of those that had been carried away, which were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats {for} a sin offering: all {this was} a burnt offering unto the LORD. 36. And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people, and the house of God. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ezra 91. So, once everything was done, the big shots came to me and said, 'Yo, the Israelites, the priests, and the Levites haven't been keeping their distance from the people of these foreign lands. They out here doing all the messed up stuff those Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites do.' 2. They've started dating and marrying people from other lands, even though they were supposed to keep their community pure. The leaders and influential ones were the ones leading this whole mess. 3. Bro, when I heard this news, I straight up tore my clothes, yanked out my hair, and sat there in complete shock. 4. So, like, everyone who was totally in awe of what the God of Israel said, showed up to see me. It was all because of those who messed up big time and got taken away. I was just sitting there, mind blown, until it was time for the evening sacrifice. 5. After the evening prayer, I got up from being downhearted. I tore my clothes and fell to my knees, stretching out my hands to the LORD my God. 6. And I'm like, OMG, I'm totally embarrassed and turning red right now to even look at you, God. Seriously, our wrongdoing has reached maximum levels, like it's way above our heads, and our guiltiness is like, sky-high. It's gotten out of control, you know? 7. Ever since our ancestors, we've been messing up big time, and we're still doing it today. Because of all the wrongs we've done, our leaders and religious folks have been handed over to the kings of other countries. They've been facing violence, captivity, plunder, and humiliation, just like what's happening right now. 8. So, like, God has totally blessed us with some grace, you know? He's given us a chance to survive and left a small group as a way out. Plus, He's setting up a solid foundation for us in His holy spot, just like a nail or pin, ya know? That way, our God can brighten our spirits and bring us some much-needed hope while we're going through tough times. Oh, and that 'moment' thing means just a really short time, by the way! 9. So, we were like totally slaves, but our God didn't ditch us when we were stuck in that crappy situation. Instead, He showed us mad love and favor in front of those Persian big shots. He gave us a sweet comeback by helping us rebuild our temple, fix all the messed-up parts, and even gave us some solid protection in Judah and Jerusalem. It was lit, fam! 10. Yo, God, what do we even say right now? Like, we totally ditched your commandments and stuff. 11. So, like, God told His prophets to say that the land you're about to take over is, like, really dirty and messed up because the people living there have all these disgusting and sinful things going on. It's like they've spread their impurity and wickedness all over the place. 12. So, like, don't let your girls date their boys, and don't let their girls date your boys, and don't try to be all friendly with them or get in on their money forever. That way you can be legit strong, enjoy the blessings of this land, and pass it down as an inheritance to your kids - for real, forever. 13. And after all the stuff that we totally brought upon ourselves because of our messed up deeds, and our major mistakes, like seriously, God you punished us way less than we actually deserved and gave us this super awesome way out; like for real, you held back even when we totally did wrong. 14. Yo, should we seriously overstep your rules again and start mixing it up with these wicked folks? Like, wouldn't you totally lose your cool with us until we're wiped out completely, so there's no one left behind? 15. Yo, like, God of Israel, you're totally righteous. 'Cause, you know, we've managed to survive up 'til now, here in your presence even though we've messed up big time. And, like, we can't even stand before you 'cause of all our mistakes. \n",
      "KJV: Ezra 91. Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, {doing} according to their abominations, {even} of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 2. For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of {those} lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass. 3. And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied. 4. Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice. 5. And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God, {heaviness: or, affliction} 6. And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over {our} head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens. {trespass: or, guiltiness} 7. Since the days of our fathers {have} we {been} in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, {and} our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as {it is} this day. 8. And now for a little space grace hath been {shewed} from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage. {space: Heb. moment} {a nail: or, a pin: that is, a constant and sure abode} 9. For we {were} bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. {to repair: Heb. to set up} 10. And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken thy commandments, 11. Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness. {by: Heb. by the hand of} {from...: Heb. from mouth to mouth} 12. Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave {it} for an inheritance to your children for ever. 13. And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities {deserve}, and hast given us {such} deliverance as this; {hast punished...: Heb. hast withheld beneath our iniquities} 14. Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed {us}, so that {there should be} no remnant nor escaping? 15. O LORD God of Israel, thou {art} righteous: for we remain yet escaped, as {it is} this day: behold, we {are} before thee in our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this. \n",
      "Gen Z: Ezra 101. So, like, when Ezra finished praying and, you know, poured out his heart and stuff, crying and literally throwing himself down in front of the house of God, a huge crowd of men, women, and even kids gathered around him from Israel. Everyone was bawling their eyes out, it was intense. #EmotionalVibes 2. So Shechaniah, Jehiel's son, one of the Elamites, spoke up and said to Ezra, dude, we messed up big time. We've been marrying these foreign chicks from the land, totally not cool. But yo, there's still hope for us in Israel if we handle this right. 3. So let's make a deal with God to break up with all the wives and their kids, just like my boss said and those who are super careful about following God's commandments. And let's do it all legally and by the book. 4. Yo, listen up; this situation is on your plate. We got your back too, so don't stress. Stay confident and handle it. 5. So Ezra stood up and gathered the head priests, the Levites, and all of Israel together, making them promise to follow this command. And they totally swore to it! 6. So Ezra left the house of God and went to Johanan's room, the son of Eliashib. And when he got there, he didn't eat any food or drink water because he was sad about the wrong actions of those who were taken away. 7. So they went around Judah and Jerusalem telling all the kids who were in exile to come join the party in Jerusalem. 8. And anyone who didn't show up within three days, as the cool peeps in charge advised, would have to give up all their stuff, and get kicked out of the crew. Oh, and their stuff would be considered like, super duper sacred. 9. So, like, all the dudes from Judah and Benjamin straight up came together in Jerusalem within three days. It was, like, the ninth month, on the twentieth day and everyone was chilling in the street outside God's crib, totally shook by what was happening and also because it was raining like crazy. Seriously, it was pouring! 10. So, like, Ezra the priest totally called them out. He was all like, 'Guys, you know you messed up big time, right? You went and married these foreign ladies, which like, totally added fuel to the fire of Israel's wrongdoing.' But, you know, just to clarify, 'have taken' can also mean 'caused to dwell' or 'brought back' in Hebrew. 11. So like, it's time to come clean and admit your wrongs to the Lord God of your ancestors. You gotta do what pleases Him and distance yourselves from the people in the land and those spouses who aren't part of your tribe. 12. And like, everyone in the group was like, 'Yeah, totally!' and said in a super loud voice, 'We're all down for that, just as you said! We're totally gonna rock it!' 13. But yo, there's a mad crowd here and it's raining like crazy. We can't just chill outside all day, this ain't no quick task. There's a bunch of us who messed up big time in this situation. 14. Yo, it's time for all the leaders of the crew to step up. And all y'all who went and married some foreigners in our cities, it's time to come together at specific times. Bring the OGs from every city and even the judges. We gotta do this until our God's anger about this situation calms down. #priorities 15. Just Jonathan, Asahel's son, and Jahaziah, Tikvah's son, were the ones who took care of this task. Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite were there to provide support. They all stood together in unity and worked together to get things done. 16. So the kids who were in captivity, like, totally obeyed. And Ezra the priest, along with some important dudes from the fam, you know, tracing their ancestry and all, they all got together and sat down on the first day of the tenth month to, like, investigate the situation. 17. And they were done dealing with all the dudes who had hooked up with non-Holy boo thangs by the start of the first month. 18. So, like, there were some priests' sons who, um, had, like, married these foreign women, you know? Specifically, it was like, Jeshua's son, Jozadak's son, and his dudes: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. 19. And they made a promise to break up with their wives, and feeling guilty, they offered a ram from their squad as a way to make up for their mistake. 20. And from the boys of Immer, there were Hanani and Zebadiah. 21. The sons of Harim were Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah. 22. And these were the dudes from the Pashur fam: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah. 23. And there were also some cool Levites in the gang: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (he's also known as Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. 24. Amongst the singers, we had Eliashib, the talented one, and as for the porters, we had Shallum, Telem, and Uri, holding it down. 25. And also in Israel there were these cool dudes from the tribe of Parosh: Ramiah, Jeziah, Malchiah, Miamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah. 26. Here are the names of Elam's sons: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Eliah. 27. Here are the cool dudes from the Zattu squad: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza. 28. And Bebai had some kids too, like Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai. 29. So, like, some of Bani's sons were Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Ramoth. 30. And the squad of Pahathmoab had the homies Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, Binnui, and Manasseh. 31. And the sons of Harim were like Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, 32. Yo, it's Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah in the house! 33. These are the names of Hashum's sons: Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei. 34. In Bani's squad we had Maadai, Amram, and Uel, 35. Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh, 36. Okay, so we've got Vaniah, Meremoth, and Eliashib, 37. Yo, Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau, 38. And Bani, and Binnui, and Shimei, 39. And like, Shelemiah, Nathan, and Adaiah, 40. Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, or maybe Mabnadebai (as some copies say) 41. Azareel, Shelemiah, and Shemariah, 42. Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph, fam. 43. Among Nebo's sons, we got Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, Joel, and Benaiah. 44. So, like, all these dudes went ahead and married these, like, foreign women. And, you know, some of them even had kids with these wives, man. \n",
      "KJV: Ezra 101. Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept very sore. {wept...: Heb. wept a great weeping} 2. And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, {one} of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing. 3. Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law. {to put...: Heb. to bring forth} 4. Arise; for {this} matter {belongeth} unto thee: we also {will be} with thee: be of good courage, and do {it}. 5. Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware. 6. Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and {when} he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away. 7. And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem; 8. And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away. {forfeited: Heb. devoted} 9. Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within three days. It {was} the ninth month, on the twentieth {day} of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of {this} matter, and for the great rain. {the great...: Heb. the showers} 10. And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel. {have taken: Heb. have caused to dwell, or, have brought back} 11. Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from the strange wives. 12. Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said, so must we do. 13. But the people {are} many, and {it is} a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither {is this} a work of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing. {we are many...: or, we have greatly offended in this thing} 14. Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us. {for this...: or, till this matter be dispatched} 15. Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were employed about this {matter}: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them. {were...: Heb. stood} 16. And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, {with} certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers, and all of them by {their} names, were separated, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. 17. And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month. 18. And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives: {namely}, of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah. 19.

      "Gen Z: Nehemiah 11. So like, Nehemiah, who's Hachaliah's kid, was, like, hanging out in Shushan the palace during the month of Chisleu in his twentieth year or whatever. 2. So this dude Hanani, who's like my bro, showed up with some homies from Judah. And I was all like, yo Hanani, tell me what's up with those Jews who made it out and are still kickin' after being in captivity. Oh, and what's the deal with Jerusalem? 3. So basically, these guys came up to me and were like, 'Dude, there's only a few people left from our capture in this place, and they're all going through some serious tough times. The city of Jerusalem is a total wreck, the walls are demolished, and the gates got burned down to ashes.'  4. So, like, when I heard this stuff, I just couldn't handle it and had to sit down and let it all out. I was all tears and grieving for a few days, and I even went on a fast and prayed hard to the God up in heaven. 5. And like, I'm like, totally begging you, God of heaven, the epic and awe-inspiring God, who always keeps His promises and shows mercy to those who love Him and follow His commandments:  6. Yo, God, listen up! Open up those eyes and ears of yours so you can hear my prayer. I've been praying for the children of Israel, your loyal peeps, day and night. And now, I wanna confess the sins of the children of Israel, including me and my fam. Yeah, we messed up too. 7. We've like, totally messed up big time against you, and we didn't follow any of the rules and stuff that you, like, told your servant Moses to follow. 8. Yo, listen up. Don't forget what you told Moses, man. You were like, 'If you mess up, I'm gonna scatter you all over the place, among different nations.' 9. But if you're down to come back to me, follow my rules, and actually do them; even if some of you get kicked out to the farthest corners of the universe, I'll still bring you back and settle you in the spot where I want my name to be. 10. These are your squad and your peeps, that you've totally come through for with your awesome power and insane strength. 11. Hey God, listen up! I humbly ask that you give your full attention to the prayer of your servant and all those who want to honor your name. Please bless me today and show me favor in front of this person. Just so you know, I used to be the king's cupbearer. \n",
      "KJV: Nehemiah 11. The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, 2. That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and {certain} men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. 3. And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province {are} in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also {is} broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire. 4. And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned {certain} days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven, 5. And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments: 6. Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned. 7. We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses. 8. Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, {If} ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the nations: 9. But {if} ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, {yet} will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there. 10. Now these {are} thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. 11. O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer. \n"
