Genesis,11,2,"So basically, at first, the earth was a hot mess. It didn't have any structure or anything, just emptiness and darkness all around. But then, the Spirit of God started doing its thing, cruising over the oceans.","And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness {was} upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
Genesis,11,3,"Then God was like, 'Yo, let there be light,' and boom, there was light.","And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
Genesis,11,4,"And God was like, 'Yo, this light is lit!' So, God separated the light from the darkness. Like, He made sure they don't mix, you know?","And God saw the light, that {it was} good: and God divided the light from the darkness. {the light from...: Heb. between the light and between the darkness}"
Genesis,11,5,"So, like, God named the light as Day and the darkness as Night. And, you know, that whole cycle of evening and morning, it marked the first day. It's like, just to clarify, the evening came, and then the morning came, and that's how the first day went down.","And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.}"
Genesis,11,6,"And God was like, yo, there should be, like, this cool layer between the water, separating it from more water. And like, this layer is actually called the 'expansion'.","And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. {firmament: Heb. expansion}"
Genesis,11,7,"And then God created, like, this super cool, massive sky thing, and He split up the water below it from the water above it. And guess what? It totally happened, just like that!","And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which {were} under the firmament from the waters which {were} above the firmament: and it was so."
Genesis,11,8,"So God named the sky Heaven. And it became the second day after the evening and morning passed. {And the evening...: Hebrew text clarifies that the evening came and the morning came, marking a new day.}","And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.}"
Genesis,11,9,"And God was like, yo, let's bring all the water together in one place and make some solid ground, and just like that, it happened.","And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry {land} appear: and it was so."
Genesis,11,10,"And God was like, 'Yo, let's name that solid ground Earth,' and the whole watery party He called Seas. And you know what? God thought it was all pretty lit.",And God called the dry {land} Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that {it was} good.
Genesis,11,11,"And God was all like, yo, let the earth do its thing and grow some sick grass, and some dope herbs that bring forth seeds, and also some lit fruit trees that produce fruit after their kind, with seeds in themselves, all up in the earth. And guess what? Boom! It happened, just like that. (By the way, 'grass' in Hebrew means some really fresh and tender grass, just FYI.)","And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, {and} the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed {is} in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. {grass: Heb. tender grass}"
Genesis,11,12,"And then, like, the earth totally grew some awesome grass and plants that had seeds of their own. Oh, and there were these cool trees that grew yummy fruits with seeds too! And God was like, 'Yo, that's super good!'","And the earth brought forth grass, {and} herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed {was} in itself, after his kind: and God saw that {it was} good."
Genesis,11,13,"So, like, the third day came to an end and a new day began. It's like, you know, the evening turned into morning. Just to clarify, when I say 'evening' I mean the start of the day and when I say 'morning' I mean the end of the day, you feel me?","And the evening and the morning were the third day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.}"
Genesis,11,14,"And God was like, 'Yo, we need some lights up in the sky to separate the day from the night. They'll be there as signs and to mark the seasons, days, and years, ya know? It's like the perfect balance between day and night!","And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: {the day...: Heb. between the day and between the night}"
Genesis,11,15,"And, like, God made these things called stars and stuff in the sky to, like, give light to the earth. And, bro, it totally happened. No lie.",And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
Genesis,11,16,"And God created two awesome sources of light: one super bright light to be in charge of the day, and another not-so-bright light to be in charge of the night. Oh, and He also made all those cool stars! #dayandnightvibes","And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: {he made} the stars also. {to rule the day...: Heb. for the rule of the day, etc.}"
Genesis,11,17,"Yo, God placed those celestial bodies up in the sky to illuminate the earth.","And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,"
Genesis,11,18,"And like, to have power over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God was like, 'Yo, that's lit!'","And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that {it was} good."
Genesis,11,19,"And then there was the fourth day, with its evening and morning. You know, like when the sun sets and then rises again. Pretty cool, right? (By the way, the Hebrew version says basically the same thing but in a different way, just so you know)","And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.}"
Genesis,11,20,"And God was like, yo, it's time for the waters to be filled with all sorts of dope creatures that have life, and birds that can soar high up in the sky, in that wide-open space above the earth. By the way, when I say 'moving creatures,' I mean the ones that crawl or whatever. And when I say lifee,' I mean those creatures with souls. And when I say 'birds,' I mean the ones that are good at flying. And when I say 'wide-open space,' I mean the face of that cool firmament in the sky.","And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl {that} may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. {moving: or, creeping} {life: Heb. soul} {fowl...: Heb. let fowl fly} {open...: Heb. face of the firmament of heaven}"
Genesis,11,21,"And yo, God made these dope whales and every livin' creature that be movin', which be poppin' outta the waters in mad numbers, each one accord'n to its kind, and all them flyin' birds accord'n to their kind too: and God peeped that it was all good, ya heard?","And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that {it was} good."
Genesis,11,22,"And God was like, yo fam, I got you! Blessing all of y'all, He was like, go forth and prosper, make yourselves  fruitful and multiply like crazy, dominate the oceans with all kinds of fish, and let the birds go wild and multiply all over the land.","And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth."
Genesis,11,23,"And like, the evening and the morning vibes were totally on point, it was the lit fifth day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.}","And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.}"
Genesis,11,24,"And God was like, 'Yo, earth! Time to bring out the living creatures, like, each one according to their own kind: cattle, creepy crawlies, and all the beasts of the land.' And guess what? It totally happened, just like that.","And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so."
Genesis,11,25,"And God created all the animals on the earth, like, totally each according to its own kind, you know? The wild beasts, the farm animals, and even all the creeping things, all unique and special in their own way. And when God looked at everything He made, He was like, 'That's good, man!'","And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that {it was} good."
Genesis,11,26,"Yo, God was like, 'Check it, let's make humans look and act like us, and let them be in charge of the fish in the ocean, the birds in the sky, all the animals on land, and everything that crawls on the ground.'","And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
Genesis,11,27,"God was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna make humans just like me, you know? So he made them in his image. And get this, he made them both male and female. Double the awesomeness!","So God created man in his {own} image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
Genesis,11,28,"And God straight up blessed them, and He was all like, 'Yo, be productive and reproduce like crazy, and fill up the earth with your peeps. Oh, and you got the power to control the fish in the sea, birds in the sky, and basically any living thing that's roaming around. You got this!'","And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. {moveth: Heb. creepeth}"
Genesis,11,29,"Yo, peep this: God's like, 'Check it, I hooked you up with all the plants that have seeds on the planet, and every tree with fruit that has seeds too. You can eat 'em all, they're your grub. For real!","And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which {is} upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which {is} the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. {bearing...: Heb. seeding seed} {yielding...: Heb. seeding seed}"
Genesis,11,30,"And I made sure that all the animals on the earth, birds in the sky, and every living creature that crawls on the ground had plenty of green plants to eat. They all depended on it for survival, and that's exactly what happened. (By the way, when I say 'living creatures' I mean beings with a soul – pretty cool, huh?)","And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein {there is} life, {I have given} every green herb for meat: and it was so. {life: Heb. a living soul}"
Genesis,11,31,"And God looked at everything he created, and wow, it was totally awesome! And then the day turned into night and then back to morning, completing the sixth day.""}","And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, {it was} very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. {And the evening...: Heb. And the evening was, and the morning was etc.}"
Genesis,21,2,"And like after finishing his epic creation, God was just like, 'Yo, I'm done.' So on the seventh day, he decided it was time to chill and take a break from all the hard work he put in.",And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
Genesis,21,3,"And God was like, 'Yo, the seventh day is lit af!'

Genesis,21,4,"So, like, this is, like, the story of how the sky and the earth were made, ya know? It all happened way back in the day when the LORD God made everything, like the earth and the heavens.","These {are} the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,"
Genesis,21,5,"And before all the plants and herbs of the field could grow, before they even existed, God had not made it rain on the earth and there weren't any humans to take care of the land.","And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and {there was} not a man to till the ground."
Genesis,21,6,Then a mist rose from the earth and watered the entire surface of the ground.,"But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. {there...: or, a mist which went up from, etc.}"
Genesis,21,7,God created the first person by shaping them from the dirt and breathing life into their nose. That's how they became a living being.,"And the LORD God formed man {of} the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. {of the dust...: Heb. dust of the ground}"
Genesis,21,8,"So, like, God created this super rad garden in Eden and placed the dude He had made right there, to the east.",And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
Genesis,21,9,"Then God, like, totally grew all these awesome trees from the ground that are, like, super pleasing to look at and great for munching on. There was even this one tree called the tree of life right in the middle of the garden, and another one called the tree of knowledge of good and evil.","And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil."
Genesis,21,10,"So, like, there was this totally rad river flowing out of Eden to water the garden. And then, it, like, split into four different streams, covering the whole place.","And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads."
Genesis,21,11,"The first spot is called Pison, and it's the area all around Havilah. You know, that place where they find lots of gold.","The name of the first {is} Pison: that {is} it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where {there is} gold;"
Genesis,21,12,The gold over there is legit amazing: they've got bdellium and onyx stones too.,And the gold of that land {is} good: there {is} bdellium and the onyx stone.
Genesis,21,13,"The second river is called Gihon—it's the one that flows all around the land of Ethiopia. (Ethiopia is also known as Cush, by the way.)",And the name of the second river {is} Gihon: the same {is} it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. {Ethiopia: Heb. Cush}
Genesis,21,14,"The third river is called Hiddekel, and it flows towards the east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.","And the name of the third river {is} Hiddekel: that {is} it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river {is} Euphrates. {toward...: or, eastward to Assyria}"
Genesis,21,15,"Then God, yo, took the homie and dropped him in the Garden of Eden to work on that greenery and keep it in check. The homie being Adam, you know what I'm saying?","And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. {the man: or, Adam}"
Genesis,21,16,"So, like, God was straight up telling the dude, 'Yo, you can totally munch on any tree in the garden, like for real, go ahead and feast on all of it!'","And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: {thou...: Heb. eating thou shalt eat}"
Genesis,21,17,"Yo, don't mess with that tree that's all about knowing good and evil. If you go ahead and eat from it, trust me, you're gonna be in major trouble. Like, you'll literally be doomed to die on the day you take a bite.","But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. {thou shalt surely...: Heb. dying thou shalt die}"
Genesis,21,18,"Yo, the LORD God was like, it's not cool for this dude to be all by himself. I got his back though, I'm gonna create a perfect partner for him.","And the LORD God said, {It is} not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. {meet...: Heb. as before him}"
Genesis,21,19,"So, like, God created all the animals on the earth and in the sky, yo. And then He took them to Adam to see what he would name them, you know? And whatever names Adam gave them, that was their official name, man. (Adam could also mean the man, just saying.)","And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought {them} unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that {was} the name thereof. {Adam: or, the man}"
Genesis,21,20,"So, Adam was like, naming all the animals, the birds, and every wild creature out there. But, he couldn't find a suitable companion for himself.","And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. {gave: Heb. called}"
Genesis,21,21,"So, God made Adam super tired and he fell into a really deep sleep. While he was snoozing, God took out one of his ribs and patched up the spot with flesh.","And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;"
Genesis,21,22,"Then God took one of Adam's ribs and used it to create a woman, whom He brought to Adam.","And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. {made: Heb. builded}"
Genesis,21,23,"Adam was like, 'Yo, this girl is straight-up a part of me. She's made from my own bones and flesh, so let's call her Woman, 'cause she came from Man.' (In Hebrew, Woman is Isha, and Man is Ish.)","And Adam said, This {is} now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. {Woman: Heb. Isha} {Man: Heb. Ish}"
Genesis,21,24,"So basically, when a dude grows up, he's gonna bounce from his parents and hang tight with his wifey. And let me tell you, they gonna be super connected, like they a single unit.","Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
Genesis,21,25,"So like, the man and his wife were totally without clothes, and they were cool with it, no shame or anything.""}","And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed."
Genesis,31,2,"The woman was like, 'Yo, Mr. Snake, we can totally chow down on any of the fruit from these wicked cool trees in the garden! 🍎🌳'","And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:"
Genesis,31,3,"But like, there's this tree in the garden, and God's like, 'Don't eat from it or even touch it, or you're toast.'"" }","But of the fruit of the tree which {is} in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die."
Genesis,31,4,"And the serpent was like, 'Nah, girl, you ain't gonna die for real:'","And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:"
Genesis,31,5,"God knows that once you eat it, your eyes will be opened and you'll be able to understand good and evil, feeling a lot more enlightened, like gods.","For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil."
Genesis,31,6,"So, the woman looked at the tree and saw that it had delicious food on it and looked really nice. Plus, she thought it would make her wise. She couldn't resist, so she took a bite from its fruit and shared it with her husband. And guess what? He took a bite too.","And when the woman saw that the tree {was} good for food, and that it {was} pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make {one} wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. {pleasant: Heb. a desire}"
Genesis,31,7,"Then both of them suddenly became aware that they were naked. So, they quickly stitched together some fig leaves and fashioned them into cover-ups.","And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they {were} naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. {aprons: or, things to gird about}"
Genesis,31,8,"And they totally heard God's voice strolling through the garden, like chillaxing in the afternoon breeze. And Adam and his wifey were like, 'OMG, we gotta hide from the Almighty!' So they went all ninja mode, camouflaging themselves amongst the trees. BTW, 'cool' in Hebrew means 'wind'. No biggie.",And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden. {cool: Heb. wind}
Genesis,31,9,"God hollers at Adam like, 'Yo, where you at, bro?","And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where {art} thou?"
Genesis,31,10,"And he was like, yo, I heard you calling out in the garden and I got hella scared because I realized I was naked, so I straight up hid myself.","And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I {was} naked; and I hid myself."
Genesis,31,11,"And God was like, 'Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree even though I told you not to?'""}","And he said, Who told thee that thou {wast} naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?"
Genesis,31,12,"So the guy was like, 'Yo, God, it's not my fault! That chick you gave me, she made me eat from the tree!'","And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest {to be} with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat."
Genesis,31,13,"So, like, the Lord God was all like, yo woman, what's up with what you just did? And the woman was like, the snake tricked me, and I couldn't resist, and I ended up eating the thing.","And the LORD God said unto the woman, What {is} this {that} thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat."
Genesis,31,14,"And like, God was all like, 'Yo, serpent! Since you pulled that shady move, you're straight-up cursed more than any other animal out there. You'll be crawling on your belly and munching on dirt for the rest of your days, no joke.'","And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou {art} cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:"
Genesis,31,15,"And I will make things real tough between you and the woman, and between your crew and her crew; someone's gonna knock you down hard, but you'll manage to hurt them a bit too.","And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
Genesis,31,16,"To the woman, He said, 'I know things are going to get tough for you when it comes to giving birth and raising kids. It's gonna be a struggle, but your love and dedication will be towards your husband, and he will take the lead in your relationship. {'Subject to your husband' is another way to put it.}"" }","Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire {shall be} to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. {to thy...: or, subject to thy husband}"
Genesis,31,17,"And God was like, 'Adam, bro, 'cause you listened to your wife and ate from that tree after I specifically told you not to, the ground is totally cursed now. You're gonna have to work super hard and deal with a lot of pain and struggle just to get food for the rest of your life, man.","And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed {is} the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat {of} it all the days of thy life;"
Genesis,31,18,"It's gonna be rough when it comes to growing stuff, you'll have to deal with thorns and thistles. And hey, forget about gourmet meals – you'll be feasting on plain ol' grass from the field. 🌱",Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; {bring...: Heb. cause to bud}
Genesis,31,19,"You're gonna have to work hard to put food on the table, until the day you die and become one with the earth again. 'Cause hey, we all came from dust, and back to dust we go.","In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou {art}, and unto dust shalt thou return."
Genesis,31,20,"And Adam gave his wife the name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. {Eve: in Hebrew, her name is Chavah, which means Living}",And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living. {Eve: Heb. Chavah: that is Living}
Genesis,31,21,Then God hooked Adam and his wife up with some fresh animal skin drip.,"Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them."
Genesis,31,22,"Yo, God was like, check it, man has leveled up and is now vibing on our wavelength, knowing what's good and what's not. But hold up, if he goes ahead and snags some of that tree of life and chows down, he gonna live forever. Can't have that, tho.","And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:"
Genesis,31,23,"So, like, God was like 'bye' and kicked him out of the garden of Eden to go farming, which is where he came from in the first place.","Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken."
Genesis,31,24,"Then he kicked the guy out and put these angelic beings with flaming swords on the east side of the garden, guarding the path to the tree that gives everlasting life.""}","So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
Genesis,41,2,"Then she gave birth to another boy named Abel. Abel took care of sheep, while Cain worked as a farmer. (Abel means 'breath' in Hebrew. 'A keeper' means 'a feeder' in Hebrew.)","And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. {Abel: Heb. Hebel} {a keeper: Heb. a feeder}"
Genesis,41,3,"After a while, Cain decided to bring an offering to the LORD. He brought some fruits from the ground as his offering.","And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD. {in process...: Heb. at the end of days}"
Genesis,41,4,"Abel rolled up with some top-notch sheep and some prime fat from his flock. And man, the big man upstairs was totally feeling it. He showed mad love to Abel and his offering.","And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: {flock: Heb. sheep, or, goats}"
Genesis,41,5,But God did not approve of Cain and his offering. This made Cain really angry and upset.,"But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell."
Genesis,41,6,"And God was like, 'Dude, why you so pissed? What's up with that gloomy face of yours?'","And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?"
Genesis,41,7,"Yo, if you're doing things right, won't you be accepted? But if you're not, sin is hanging out, ready to trip you up. And you, my friend, have the power to rule over it. #Respect","If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee {shall be} his desire, and thou shalt rule over him. {be accepted: or, have the excellency} {unto...: or, subject unto thee}"
Genesis,41,8,"So, Cain and Abel were having a convo, you know, just chillin' in the field. And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, Cain straight up attacked Abel and, unfortunately, killed him.","And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."
Genesis,41,9,"And God was like, 'Hey Cain, where's your brother Abel?' And Cain was like, 'IDK man, am I supposed to be responsible for him?'","And the LORD said unto Cain, Where {is} Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: {Am} I my brother's keeper?"
Genesis,41,10,"And God was like, 'Dude, what did you do? Your brother's blood is literally calling out to me from the ground.

Exodus,11,6,"And Joseph passed away, along with all his squad, and everyone from that OG crew.","And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation."
Exodus,11,7,"So, like, the Israelite kids were totally productive and grown big time, and they multiplied like crazy, becoming super strong; and the whole land was, like, totally packed with them.","And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them."

Exodus,11,19,"So the midwives told Pharaoh, like, the Hebrew women are just different from the Egyptian women, you know? They're so energetic and give birth really quickly, even before we get a chance to show up.","And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women {are} not as the Egyptian women; for they {are} lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them."
Exodus,11,20,"So God totally blessed the midwives, and the population blew up and became super strong.","Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty."
Exodus,11,21,"So, like, because the midwives were pretty scared of God and stuff, He was like, 'Yo, I'm gonna give you guys some fancy houses.'","And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses."
Exodus,11,22,"So Pharaoh told everyone, like, hear me out guys, I want you to throw all the baby boys into the river, but, like, save all the baby girls, okay?","And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive."

Exodus,21,3,"So, when she couldn't hide him anymore, she grabbed a fancy raft and gave it a makeover with some sticky stuff. Then, she tucked the baby inside and gently placed it among the reeds by the river's edge.","And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid {it} in the flags by the river's brink."
Exodus,21,4,"And his sis was like watching from a distance, curious to see what was gonna happen to him.","And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him."
Exodus,21,5,"So like, the Pharaoh's daughter went to the river to take a dip, with her girls nearby. And guess what? She spotted this cool floating thing in the reeds. She was like, 'Go grab that thing,' and sent one of her girls to get it.","And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash {herself} at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it."
Exodus,21,6,"And when she looked inside, she saw the baby crying. It touched her heart, and she said, 'This is one of the Hebrews' kids.'","And when she had opened {it}, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This {is one} of the Hebrews' children."
Exodus,21,7,"So the sister was like, 'Hey Pharaoh's daughter, should I find a Hebrew lady to take care of the baby for you?'","Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?"
Exodus,21,8,"Pharaoh's daughter was like, 'Sure, go ahead.' So the maid dipped and hit up the child's actual mom.","And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother."
Exodus,21,9,"Pharaoh's daughter was like, 'Yo, take this kid and raise him for me, and I'll hook you up with some cash.' So the woman grabbed the baby and did the nursing thing.","And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give {thee} thy wages.

Exodus,21,10,"As the kid grew up, the woman took him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he officially became her son.

And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. {Moses: that is, Drawn out}"
Exodus,21,11,"So, like, back in the day when Moses became all grown up and stuff, he went out to hang with his homies, and he saw how much they were struggling with their loads. And guess what? He caught this Egyptian dude hitting a Hebrew, who was actually part of his squad. Can you believe it?","And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren."
Exodus,21,12,"So, he like, checked out both sides, and when he realized there was no one around, he straight up took down the Egyptian bro and buried him in the sand.","And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that {there was} no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand."
Exodus,21,13,"So, like, the next day this guy goes out and, whoa, he sees these two Hebrew dudes going all out, arguing and stuff. And he's like, yo dude who started it, why you gotta be hitting your bro like that?","And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?"
Exodus,21,14,"And he was like, 'Yo, who made you the boss and the judge over us? Are you trying to end me like you did to that Egyptian dude?'

And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. {a prince: Heb. a man, a prince}"
Exodus,21,15,"So, like, when Pharaoh found out about what Moses did, he was totally out for blood. But Moses bailed and escaped Pharaoh's wrath, and ended up chilling in Midian. And you know what? He just plopped himself down by a well and kicked it there.","Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well."
Exodus,21,16,"So, this dude who was like a priest in Midian had these seven daughters and they went to draw some water and fill up the troughs to water their dad's flock.

Exodus,21,23,"So, like, after a while, the pharaoh of Egypt passed away, and the Israelite peeps were totally fed up with being enslaved. They couldn't take it anymore, ya know? They cried out in desperation, and their cries reached God because of the super harsh slavery and all.","And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage."

It was wild.","And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush {was} not consumed."

Numbers,31,3,"So, these are the names of Aaron's boys, the cool priests who were chosen and set apart to do their priestly duties. It's like they got totally blessed by being anointed. And just to be clear, they were chosen and filled with the power to do their priestly thing by Aaron himself.","These {are} the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office. {whom...: Heb. whose hand he filled}"
Numbers,31,4,"So, Nadab and Abihu straight up got smited by the LORD because they pulled a major goof and offered some sketchy fire in the presence of the LORD. This happened in the wild 'n' free Sinai land, and to top it off, they didn't even have any kids. To fill their vacancy, Eleazar and Ithamar stepped up and did the priestly tasks while Aaron, their dad, looked on.","And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father."

And anyone who ain't part of the crew better watch out 'cause they'll be straight up terminated.","And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death."
Numbers,31,11,"yo, God came at Moses like,","And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,"

Numbers,31,17,"So, like, these were the dudes from the Levi squad, you know? They had some pretty cool names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.","And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari."

Pretty impressive, right?","All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, {were} twenty and two thousand."
Numbers,31,40,"Yo, Moses, listen up. God wants you to count all the baby dudes of Israel, who are one month old and older.

Deuteronomy,21,26,"So I DM'd some influencers from the middle of nowhere to chat up Sihon, the boss of Heshbon. I came in peace, yo, and dropped some chill words, like,","And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,"

Deuteronomy,21,30,"But Sihon, the king of Heshbon, refused to let us go through his territory because the LORD your God made him stubborn and resistant, so that he could be defeated by you, as it is evident today.","But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as {appeareth} this day."
Deuteronomy,21,31,"So, like, God was all like, 'Yo, listen up! I've already started handing over Sihon and his land to you. Get ready to take possession of it and make it yours.'","And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land."

We were strictly told not to go there by the LORD our God.","Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, {nor} unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us."
Deuteronomy,31,2,"So, God was like, don't be scared, I got you covered! I'll hand over this dude, his crew, and his whole land to you. Just do to him what you did to that Amorite king Sihon who lived in Heshbon, no biggie.","And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon."

It's gonna be your dope coast, bro.","From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast."
Joshua,11,5,"No one will ever be able to come against you throughout your life, just like how I was with Moses, I'll be with you too. I won't let you down or abandon you.","There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, {so} I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee."
Joshua,11,6,"Stay strong and confident, because it's up to you to divide the land among these people as their inheritance. I promised their ancestors that I would give them this land.","Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them. {unto this...: or, thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land, etc}"
Joshua,11,7,"Just be strong and super brave, yo, and make sure you follow all the rules that Moses, my servant, told you about. Don't swerve to the right or left, like, stay on track! Then you'll be successful wherever you go, like killin' it in life, you know?","Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it {to} the right hand or {to} the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest. {prosper: or, do wisely}"
Joshua,11,8,"Keep this rulebook on your tongue all the time and ponder over it day and night, so that you can follow everything written in it. By doing so, you'll find success and prosper in whatever you do.","This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. {have...: or, do wisely}"
Joshua,11,9,"Like, haven't I told you? Just be strong and confident, don't be scared or freaked out at all.

Joshua,11,10,"So Joshua was like, 'Hey, officers of the people, listen up!'","Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,"
Joshua,11,11,"Yo, go tell everyone in the squad to get ready and stock up on food. In three days, we're crossing over the Jordan to claim the land that God promised us. It's all ours to own, bro!","Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it."
Joshua,11,12,"So Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, saying,","And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,"
Joshua,11,13,"Yo, don't forget what Moses, the servant of the LORD, told ya! He was all like, 'The LORD your God has totally hooked you up with rest and this sick land, man.'","Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land."
Joshua,11,14,"So, like, all your wives, kids, and even your farm animals, they get to stay in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan river. But you guys, the strong and courageous ones, gotta cross over before your fellow peeps, all organized and ready to fight, and lend 'em a hand. {marshalled by five: Hebrew for, you know, all organized and stuff}","Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them; {armed: Heb. marshalled by five}"
Joshua,11,15,"Until the LORD has let your squad finally chillax, just like how He's let you all, and they've also snagged the area that the LORD your God is hooking them up with, then you can bounce back to your own territory and have a blast there. It's the same one that Moses, the LORD's ride-or-die servant, gave you on the side of the Jordan River where the sun rises.","Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as {he hath given} you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD'S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising."
Joshua,11,16,"And they responded to Joshua, like, 'Dude, whatever you tell us to do, we're totally down for it. And wherever you want us to go, we're totally there.'","And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go."
Joshua,11,17,"We totally listened to Moses and we'll totally listen to you too, as long as the LORD your God is on your side, just like he was with Moses!","According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses."
Joshua,11,18,"If someone decides to go against what you say and refuses to listen to your instructions, they will face serious consequences, even death. But don't worry, stay confident and brave in the face of challenges.","Whosoever {he be} that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage."
Joshua,21,2,"So, the king of Jericho was informed that some dudes from Israel snuck in here last night to check out the land.","And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country."
Joshua,21,3,"So the king of Jericho hit up Rahab and was like, 'Yo, bring out those dudes who rolled up to your crib. They're here to scope out the whole area.'","And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country."
Joshua,21,4,"So the woman grabbed the two guys and hid them. She was like, 'Yo, these dudes showed up at my place, but I had no clue where they came from, man.'","And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they {were}:"
Joshua,21,5,"So, like, when the gate was about to close and it got all dark and stuff, the dudes went out. I have no idea where they went, but chase after them real fast, 'cause you'll totally catch up to them!","And it came to pass {about the time} of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them."
Joshua,21,6,"So, she like totally led them to the rooftop and hid them with these stacks of flax that she had carefully arranged up there.","But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof."
Joshua,21,7,"So the guys chased after them all the way to the Jordan River crossing, and as soon as those guys were outta there, they locked the gate.","And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate."
Joshua,21,8,"And before they settled in, she went up to the roof to chill with them;","And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;"
Joshua,21,9,"And she said to the guys, I know that the LORD hooked you up with this land, and y'all got us shook. All the people living here are straight-up melting with fear because of you.","And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you. {faint: Heb. melt}"
Joshua,21,10,"So, like, check it out, dudes. We've been hearing all about how the LORD totally made the water in the Red Sea disappear when you peeps were making your way out of Egypt. And, like, let's not forget about how you completely crushed those two kings of the Amorites, Sihon and Og, who were chilling on the other side of the Jordan River. Epic destruction, man!","For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that {were} on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed."
Joshua,21,11,"And once we had heard all this, we were shook to the core. No one had any bravery left in them because of you. It's because the LORD your God, he's the real deal up in heaven and down on earth.","And as soon as we had heard {these things}, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the LORD your God, he {is} God in heaven above, and in earth beneath. {did there...: Heb. rose up}"
Joshua,21,12,"Okay, listen up! Can you do me a favor and promise me, like, swear it by the LORD? You know, because I've been pretty cool to you. So, I'm just asking if you could also be cool to my family, ya know, show them some love and give me a clear sign that you're down with it!","Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token:"
Joshua,21,13,"Yo, promise to keep my parents, siblings, and everything they own safe, and save us from any danger or death.","And {that} ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death."
Joshua,21,14,"And the guys were like, hey, your secrets are safe with us. We promise that once we conquer the land, we'll totally be cool and honest with you. Trust us, we got your back. #Loyalty","And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee. {for...: Heb. instead of you to die}"
Joshua,21,15,"So she, like, totally lowered them down using a rope through the window since her crib was on the city wall and she lived on the wall.","Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house {was} upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall."
Joshua,21,16,"She was like, 'Yo, head to the mountain ASAP so you don't run into those chasers. Chill there for three days until they bounce, then you can dip.'","And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way."
Joshua,21,17,"And the guys were like, 'Yo, we ain't gonna take no blame for that oath you made us swear.'","And the men said unto her, We {will be} blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear."
Joshua,21,18,"Yo, when we finally enter the land, make sure you tie this sick red thread in the window where you let us down. Then, gather your fam - your dad, mom, siblings, and everyone in your dad's crib - all under one roof. Eazy peazy lemon squeezy.","Behold, {when} we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee. {bring: Heb. gather}"
Joshua,21,19,"Yo, listen up! If anyone leaves your crib and gets hurt out on the streets, it's on them - we ain't responsible! But if they chill with you at home and something happens, we'll take the blame, man, no problem!","And it shall be, {that} whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood {shall be} upon his head, and we {will be} guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood {shall be} on our head, if {any} hand be upon him."
Joshua,21,20,"And if you spill the tea on our business, we won't hold you to that promise you made us.","And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear."
Joshua,21,21,"She was like, 'Okay, if you say so.' Then she let them go and they left. And she tied a red string in the window.","And she said, According unto your words, so {be} it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window."
Joshua,21,22,"So they went to the mountain and stayed there for three days, until the people chasing them went back. The pursuers searched everywhere, but couldn't find them.","And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought {them} throughout all the way, but found {them} not."
Joshua,21,23,"So like, those two dudes came back from the mountain, and they went down and crossed over, and they found Joshua, you know, Nun's son, and they spilled all the tea about what went down.","So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all {things} that befell them:"
Joshua,21,24,"And they were like, dude, Joshua, you won't believe it! The LORD totally handed over all the land to us. I mean, seriously, all the people living there are freaking out because of us. They're literally melting with fear, bro! {faint: in Hebrew, it means melt}","And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us. {faint: Heb. melt}"
Judges,11,2,"God was like, 'Yo, Judah gonna take over. Check it out, I made him victorious over the land.'","And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand."
Judges,11,3,"And Judah was like, 'Yo, Simeon, let's team up and take on those Canaanites in my territory. And I'll totally have your back when we fight in your turf too, bro.' So Simeon was like, 'Sure thing, man. I'm down.'

They took him to Jerusalem, and that's where he kicked the bucket, man.","And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered {their meat} under my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me.

Judges,21,16,"But like, the LORD was all like, 'I got you fam,' and raised up these judges who totally saved them from those who were wrecking them. savedd means, like, saved, you know?)","Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them. {delivered: Heb. saved}"
Judges,21,17,"But they totally ignored their judges, completely hooked on other gods and worshipped them. They ditched the righteous path their ancestors followed, disobeying the LORD's commandments, and it was not cool.","And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; {but} they did not so."
Judges,21,18,"So, like, when God appointed judges, he totally had their back and saved them from their enemies the whole time they were in charge. It's because God felt really bad for them, you know? They were super bummed out and oppressed, and it really got to God.","And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them."
Judges,21,19,"So like, after the judge died, they went back to their old ways and like, totally went even further than their ancestors in worshiping other gods and like, doing all the bowing down stuff. They just couldn't stop themselves from doing their own rebellious things and following their stubborn ways.","And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, {that} they returned, and corrupted {themselves} more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way. {corrupted...: or, were corrupt} {ceased...: Heb. let nothing fall of their}"

Judges,21,21,"I ain't gonna kick out anyone from the nations that Joshua didn't fully clear out before he passed away, ya know?",I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:
Judges,21,22,"So I can test out these peeps and see if they'll stick to the Lord's path like their ancestors did, or not. Ya feel?","That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep {it}, or not."
Judges,21,23,"So God let those nations stay there, instead of making them leave right away or giving them to Joshua.","Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua. {left: or, suffered}"
1 Samuel,21,2,"No one can match the holiness of the LORD, 'cause there's nobody else like Him. No one's as solid and awesome as our God.",{There is} none holy as the LORD: for {there is} none beside thee: neither {is there} any rock like our God.

Uh, it says 'assembled by troops' in the original Hebrew, whatever that means.","Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled {at} the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. {assembled: Heb. assembled by troops}"

The Almighty is telling you, like did He not make it crystal clear back in the day to your family back in Egypt, when they were chilling in Pharaoh's crib?","And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?"
1 Samuel,21,28,"Like, did I specifically pick him from, like, all the tribes of Israel to be my priest and do all these lit things like offering sacrifices on my altar, burning incense, and rocking that ephod in front of me? And didn't I also give the offerings the Israelites brought to the house of your dad?","And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel {to be} my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?"
1 Samuel,21,29,"Why are you dissing my sacrifice and offering that I specifically told you to do in my house? And why are you honoring your sons more than me, trying to get all the best stuff from the offerings of my people, Israel?","Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded {in my} habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?"
1 Samuel,21,30,"So, like, the LORD God of Israel is saying, I totally said that your family, including your dad's fam, were gonna be all righteous and stuff forever. But now the LORD is like, uh-uh, not happening. 'Cause those who show respect for me will be respected, but those who diss me will be totally put down.","Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed {that} thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed."

Join} {one of...: or, somewhat about the priesthood}"
1 Samuel,31,2,"So, like, this happened when Eli was lying down in his spot and his vision started getting blurry, like, he couldn't see anything anymore.","And it came to pass at that time, when Eli {was} laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, {that} he could not see;"
1 Samuel,31,3,"And before the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was getting some rest;","And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God {was}, and Samuel was laid down {to sleep};"
1 Samuel,31,4,"So, like, God totally called out to Samuel and he was like, 'Yo, here I am, what's up?'","That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here {am} I."
1 Samuel,31,5,"So he went up to Eli and was like, 'Yo, you called me?' And Eli was like, 'Nah bro, I didn't call you. Go back to bed.' And the dude went back and crashed.","And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down."
1 Samuel,31,6,"Yo, the LORD hit up Samuel once again. So Samuel got up and went to Eli, saying, 'Here I am, you called me?' But Eli was like, 'Nah, my dude, I didn't call you. Go back to bed.'","And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again."
1 Samuel,31,7,"At that time, Samuel didn't actually know God yet, and God hadn't revealed His message to him either. (Just so you know, this all happened before Samuel had a personal relationship with God or received His divine instructions.)","Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him. {Now...: or, Thus did Samuel before he knew the LORD, and before the word of the LORD was revealed unto him}"
1 Samuel,31,8,"Then, like, the LORD called Samuel again, you know, for the third time, and Samuel was all like, 'Okay, okay, I'm coming!' So he got up and went to Eli, and was like, 'Yo, you called me?' And Eli realized that it was actually the LORD who had called the kid.","And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here {am} I; for thou didst call me. And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child."
1 Samuel,31,9,"So Eli was like yo, Samuel, go chillax and lay down. If you hear someone calling you, say 'What's up, LORD? I'm all ears.' So Samuel did as Eli said and went to crash in his spot.","Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place."
1 Samuel,31,10,"Then God showed up and was like, 'Samuel, Samuel!' And Samuel was like, 'Yo, what's up? I'm listening, talk to me.'","And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth."
1 Samuel,31,11,"So, like, God was all like, 'Yo, Samuel! Check it out, I'm about to make something happen in Israel that'll totally blow everyone's mind, like their ears will be ringing and stuff.'","And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle."
1 Samuel,31,12,"On that day, I'm gonna do everything I said I would against Eli and his family. Once I start, I won't stop until it's finished. It's gonna be epic, fam! #BeginningAndEnding","In that day I will perform against Eli all {things} which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end. {when...: Heb. beginning and ending}"
1 Samuel,31,13,"So I'm like, telling him straight up that I'm gonna judge his whole fam forever, 'cause they're totally doing messed up stuff that they know is wrong. His sons are acting all disgusting and he's not even doing anything about it, not even giving them a disappointed look or anything.","For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not. {For I...: or, And I will tell him} {vile: or, accursed} {restrained...: Heb. frowned not upon them}"
1 Samuel,31,14,"So, I've, like, totally made this oath to Eli's family, that, like, their wickedness can't just be wiped away with sacrifices or offerings, you know? Like, it's gonna stick with them forever.","And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever."
1 Samuel,31,15,"So Samuel crashed at the crib all night, then woke up in the morning and unlocked the doors to God's house. But he was low-key stressed about sharing the vision with Eli.","And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision."
1 Samuel,31,16,"So Eli called out to Samuel and was like, 'Yo, Samuel, my dude.' And Samuel was all like, 'What's up? I'm right here.'","Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here {am} I."
1 Samuel,31,17,"And he was like, dude, what did the LORD tell you? Seriously, don't keep it a secret from me, bro. I swear, if you hide anything from me, may God totally punish you and stuff. And I mean it, whatever He said to you, spill the tea. Like, seriously: don't hold anything back, ya know? {more also: Hebrew for, like, 'extra'} {thing: or, word}","And he said, What {is} the thing that {the LORD} hath said unto thee? I pray thee hide {it} not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide {any} thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee. {more also: Heb. so add} {thing: or, word}"
1 Samuel,31,18,"Samuel spilled all the tea, didn't hold back a thing. He was like, 'Yo, it's all God's plan, let Him do what He thinks is best.'","And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It {is} the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good. {every...: Heb. all the things, or, words}"
1 Samuel,31,19,"Samuel was like, totally thriving, and God was like, always by his side, making sure none of his words went unnoticed.","And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground."
1 Samuel,31,20,"And, like, everyone in Israel, from like Dan to Beersheba, totally knew that Samuel was, like, confirmed as a prophet of the LORD. #legit #faithful","And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel {was} established {to be} a prophet of the LORD. {established: or, faithful}"
1 Samuel,31,21,"So, the LORD showed up again in Shiloh, 'cause that's where the LORD decided to reveal himself to Samuel. And guess how? Yeah, it was through the word of the LORD.",And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.
2 Samuel,11,2,"So, like, on the third day, this guy comes out of the camp, right? His clothes are all torn and he's got dirt on his head and stuff. And, boom, when he reaches David, he falls to the ground and shows mad respect.","It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and {so} it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance."
2 Samuel,11,3,"So David was like, 'Yo, where'd you come from?' And the dude was like, 'Bro, I just escaped from the Israel camp.'","And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped."
2 Samuel,11,4,"So David was like, dude, what went down? Seriously, spill the tea. And the guy's all like, bro, everyone ditched the fight, and a bunch of them got wrecked. Plus, Saul and Jonathan, his son, they're both gone too. Just like, dead. Yeah, it's messed up, man.","And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. {How...: Heb. What was, etc}"
2 Samuel,11,5,"David was like, 'Yo, how do you even know for sure that Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead?'","And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?"
2 Samuel,11,6,"So, this dude who saw it go down, was like, I randomly stumbled upon mount Gilboa, and guess what? Saul was leaning on his spear, and there were the mad chariots and horsemen chasing after him, yo!","And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him."
2 Samuel,11,7,"And like, when he turned around, he spotted me and reached out to me. And I was like, yo, what's up? And I was all like, here I am, like totally ready to be there for you, you know?","And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here {am} I. {Here...: Heb. Behold me}"
2 Samuel,11,8,"And he was like, 'Yo, who you be?' And I was like, 'I'm an Amalekite.'","And he said unto me, Who {art} thou? And I answered him, I {am} an Amalekite."
2 Samuel,11,9,"He was like, yo, come at me again and take me down, 'cause I'm feeling mad stressed out with this heaviness in my life that's just weighing me down. It's like my armor is holding me back, you know?","He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life {is} yet whole in me. {anguish...: or, my coat of mail (or, my embroidered coat) hindereth me, that my, etc}"
2 Samuel,11,10,"So, like, I totally went for it and took him down because I knew there was no way he could survive the fall. Then, I grabbed the crown off his head and the bracelet off his arm and I brought them here for my boss, ya know.","So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that {was} upon his head, and the bracelet that {was} on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord."
2 Samuel,11,11,"So David, like, literally grabbed his clothes and tore them apart, and all the other dudes with him were like, doing the same thing, you know:","Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that {were} with him:"
2 Samuel,11,12,"And they were like super sad and cried a ton and didn't eat all day, you know, for Saul, and his son Jonathan, and the people who believed in God, and for all Israel, because they got killed in battle.","And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword."
2 Samuel,11,13,"David asked the dude who gave him the scoop, 'Where do you come from?' And he replied, 'I'm from out of town, I'm an Amalekite.'","And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence {art} thou? And he answered, I {am} the son of a stranger, an Amalekite."
2 Samuel,11,14,"And David was like, dude, weren't you even scared to reach out and mess with someone who was chosen by the LORD?","And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?"
2 Samuel,11,15,"So David grabbed one of his homies, and was like, 'Yo, get close to him and take him down.' And then he straight up knocked him out and killed him.","And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, {and} fall upon him. And he smote him that he died."
2 Samuel,11,16,"David was like, 'Bro, your actions are on you, 'cause you straight up confessed to killing the chosen one of the LORD with your mouth, man.'","And David said unto him, Thy blood {be} upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD'S anointed."
2 Samuel,11,17,"So, like, David was filled with sadness and wrote this really deep lament about Saul and his son Jonathan:",And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
2 Samuel,11,18,"He told them to teach the kids in Judah how to shoot bows—like, it's right there in the Jasher book. (Just so you know, 'Jasher' means 'upright' in case you were wondering.)","(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah {the use of} the bow: behold, {it is} written in the book of Jasher.) {of Jasher: or, of the upright}"
2 Samuel,11,19,"Dude, it's so heartbreaking! The cool peeps from Israel, they got crushed in the most prominent spots. It's like, why did the strong ones have to go down? It's a total bummer!",The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
2 Samuel,11,20,"Don't even spill the tea in Gath, don't flex in the streets of Askelon. We don't want those Philistine girls getting too hyped, or the uncircumcised girls flexing too hard.","Tell {it} not in Gath, publish {it} not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph."
2 Samuel,11,21,"Yo, Gilboa mountains, no need for any dew or rain to fall on you. Don't expect any fields of offerings either. It's because over there, the shield of the mighty Saul was shamefully discarded, like it wasn't even anointed with oil.","Ye mountains of Gilboa, {let there be} no dew, neither {let there be} rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, {as though he had} not {been} anointed with oil."
2 Samuel,11,22,"The epic moves of Jonathan and Saul were unmatched - they never held back, leaving a trail of fallen foes and victorious battles.

And they hit up David, like, yo, it was the dudes from Jabeshgilead who took care of Saul's burial.","And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, {That} the men of Jabeshgilead {were they} that buried Saul."

But the homies in Judah were all about David.","Ishbosheth Saul's son {was} forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David."
2 Samuel,21,11,"So, like, David was totally ruling in Hebron for, like, seven years and six months, you know? It was, like, a pretty long time n' all. {time: BTW, Hebrew peeps count it in days}",And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months. {time: Heb. number of days}

Helkathhazzurim means, like, The field of strong dudes or something.","And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and {thrust} his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which {is} in Gibeon. {Helkathhazzurim: that is, The field of strong men}"

Why do I gotta hurt you and humiliate myself in front of your bro Joab?","And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?"
2 Samuel,21,23,"But he totally didn't want to back down, so Abner straight up hit him with the back end of his spear right in the side, like really hard. The spear went clean through him and came out the other side. He just straight up died right then and there. And it's crazy, but everyone who saw Asahel fall down and die just froze in their tracks, man.","Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth {rib}, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, {that} as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still."

2 Samuel,21,26,"So Abner hits up Joab and is like, 'Bro, do we gotta just keep killin' each other? Don't you realize it's gonna bring hella bitterness in the long run? How much longer do we gotta wait before you tell our peeps to stop chasing after their own fam?'","Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?"
2 Samuel,21,27,"Joab was like, 'I swear to God, if you hadn't said anything, everyone would have split up in the morning and gone their own way.'","And Joab said, {As} God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother. {in the...: Heb. from the morning} {gone...: or, gone away}"
2 Samuel,21,28,"Then Joab pulled out his phone and played a sick beat, and everyone just froze and stopped chasing after Israel. They were like, nah, no more fighting.","So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more."

Finally, they arrived at their destination, Mahanaim.","And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim."

And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day."
1 Kings,11,2,"So his homies said to him, yo, we gotta find a fresh young babe for my boy the king. She gonna stand by his side, show him love and be his bae.

1 Kings,11,49,"And all of Adonijah's crew got shook, bounced and scattered.","And all the guests that {were} with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way."
1 Kings,11,50,"Adonijah got scared of Solomon, so he hopped up, went out, and grabbed onto the altar's horns.","And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar."
1 Kings,11,51,"So, Solomon got a message that basically said, 'Yo, check it out, Adonijah is scared of you, bro. He's freaking clutching onto the altar like his life depends on it, begging you to pinky swear that you won't go all sword-wielding crazy and kill him today.'","And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword."
1 Kings,11,52,"Solomon was like, if this dude proves he's legit, not a single strand of his hair will be harmed. But if he turns out to be wicked, he's donezo.","And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die."
1 Kings,11,53,"So King Solomon was like, 'Yo, go get him from the altar.' And they brought him down and he came over, showed mad respect by bowing to King Solomon. Then Solomon was like, 'Bro, time for you to head back home.'","So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house."
1 Kings,21,2,"I'm about to kick the bucket like everyone else: so, like, man up and show some real strength!","I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself a man;"
1 Kings,21,3,"Make sure you obey the rules of the LORD your God and follow his ways, keeping all his laws, commandments, judgments, and testimonies that are written in the law of Moses. By doing this, you'll succeed in everything you do and wherever you go. {succeed: or, be wise}","And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself: {prosper: or, do wisely}"
1 Kings,21,4,"So basically, God's like, 'Yo, I'm gonna make sure my promise to you stays legit, bro. If your fam stays on point, walking in truth with their whole being, I promise you won't be lacking a king ruling over Israel. Like, seriously, no one's gonna snatch that away from you.'","That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee saidd he) a man on the throne of Israel. {fail...: Heb. be cut off from thee from the throne}"
1 Kings,21,5,"Also, you're aware of all the messed up stuff Joab did to me, right? He straight up killed Abner and Amasa, who were high-ranking dudes in Israel's army! And get this, he spilled their blood even when there wasn't a dang war going on. He was so ruthless, he stained his belt and shoes with their blood like some sick trophy.","Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, {and} what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that {was} about his loins, and in his shoes that {were} on his feet. {shed: Heb. put}"
1 Kings,21,6,"So, like, use your smarts and make sure his gray hair doesn't rest in peace when he kicks the bucket.","Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace."
1 Kings,21,7,"Yo, be cool to the dudes from Barzillai's fam, the Gileadites, and let 'em chill at your table, 'cause they had my back when I bounced 'cause of your brother Absalom.","But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother."
1 Kings,21,8,"Yo, check it out, you still got Shimei, Gera's son, a Benjamite from Bahurim, who seriously cursed me over at Mahanaim. But when I got to the Jordan, he came to meet me, and I made a promise to him in the name of the LORD, saying, I won't kill you with a sword, bro. Word.","And, behold, {thou hast} with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword. {grievous: Heb. strong}"
1 Kings,21,9,"So like, don't just let him slide, dude. You're totally wise and know exactly what you should do to him. But make sure he pays for his wrongs, even if it means taking him down to the grave with just retribution.","Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou {art} a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood."
1 Kings,21,10,"After living a full life, David passed away and was laid to rest in the city of David.","So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David."
1 Kings,21,11,"So, David was in charge of Israel for a whole 40 years. He started his reign in Hebron and ruled there for 7 years. Then, he moved to Jerusalem and ruled for another 33 years.","And the days that David reigned over Israel {were} forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem."
1 Kings,21,12,"So Solomon slid into David's throne, a total power move, and his kingdom was totally lit, like, it was on another level.",Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.
1 Kings,21,13,"So Adonijah, Haggith's son, went to meet Solomon's mom, Bathsheba. And she was like, 'Are you here to cause any trouble?' And he was like, 'Nah, just chillin'.","And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably."
1 Kings,21,14,"He was like, 'Yo, I got something to tell you.' And she was like, 'Spill the tea!'","He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on."
1 Kings,21,15,"And he was like, you know that the kingdom used to be mine, and, like, all of Israel was supporting me to be the ruler. But, like, things have totally flipped, and now the kingdom belongs to my bro because the Big Guy upstairs said so.","And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and {that} all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD."
1 Kings,21,16,"So like, I've got this one favor to ask. Please don't say no. And she's all like, 'Yeah, sure, spill it.'","And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on. {deny...: Heb. turn not away my face}"
1 Kings,21,17,"So, like, he was all, 'Dude, please talk to King Solomon and ask him for me, because he totally won't refuse, to let me marry Abishag the Shunammite.'","And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife."
1 Kings,21,18,"And Bathsheba was like, okay, I gotchu fam, I'll go talk to the king for you.","And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king."
1 Kings,21,19,"So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to talk to him about Adonijah. When the king saw her, he got up, greeted her, and took a seat on his throne. He even arranged for a chair to be set up for his mom, who sat on his right side.","Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right hand."
1 Kings,21,20,"So she's like, I've got this small request, pretty pretty please don't deny me. And the king's like, Sure, go ahead, mom! I won't say no to you.","Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; {I pray thee}, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay."
1 Kings,21,21,"And she was like, yo, give Abishag the Shunammite to Adonijah, your bro, as his wife, you know?","And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife."
1 Kings,21,22,"Yo, listen up, Queen Mother! Why are you going to Abishag the Shunammite to ask for Adonijah? If you want, just go ahead and ask for the whole kingdom! 'Cause guess what? He's my older bro, so he's got a claim too, along with Abiathar the priest and Joab, son of Zeruiah.","And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he {is} mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah."
1 Kings,21,23,"And like, King Solomon literally swears by the LORD, and he's all like, Godd better do all sorts of crazy stuff to me, like seriously intense stuff, if Adonijah didn't say this thing that's gonna totally mess up his life.'","Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life."
1 Kings,21,24,"So, like, I swear to God, the Almighty One who made me king and put me on the throne that belonged to my dad David, and who fulfilled the promise of giving me a palace; today, Adonijah will totally face death.","Now therefore, {as} the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day."
1 Kings,21,25,"So King Solomon sent Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, to take care of business, and let's just say things didn't end well for the guy.",And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
1 Kings,21,26,"The king told Abiathar the priest, 'Go to Anathoth and tend to your own land. You deserve to die, but I won't kill you now because you served in front of God's ark for my father David and went through all the hardships he endured.'","And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou {art} worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted. {worthy...: Heb. a man of death}"
1 Kings,21,27,"So Solomon kicked Abiathar out from being a priest for the LORD, to make sure that what the LORD said about Eli's family in Shiloh would happen.","So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh."
1 Kings,21,28,"So Joab heard the news because he was hanging out with Adonijah, not with Absalom. Joab got scared and ran to the LORD's hangout spot, grabbing onto the altar for dear life.","Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar."
1 Kings,21,29,"So, like, word got to King Solomon that Joab escaped to the sacred place of the LORD, and guess what, he's chillin' right by the altar. So, Solomon's like, 'Yo, Benaiah, son of Jehoiada, go get him!'","And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, {he is} by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him."
1 Kings,21,30,"So Benaiah went to the place where God was chilling, and he was like, 'Yo, the King wants you to come out.' But the guy was like, 'Nah, I'm staying here and I'm ready to die.' Then Benaiah went back to the King and was like, 'This is what Joab said, and this is how he responded to me.'","And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me."
1 Kings,21,31,"Then the king was like, 'Yeah, do what he said and tackle him, bury him and all. We gotta make sure to clear Joab's name from spilling innocent blood on me and my fam.'","And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father."
1 Kings,21,32,"And God will make him pay for what he did by making him suffer. He attacked two guys who were way cooler and righteous than him, and straight up murdered them. My dad David had no idea about any of this, just to be clear. The dudes he killed were Abner, the boss of Israel's army, and Amasa, the boss of Judah's army.","And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing {thereof, to wit}, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah."
1 Kings,21,33,"So Joab and his descendants will bear the responsibility for their actions, paying for it with their own blood. But as for David, his descendants, his household, and his throne, they will enjoy everlasting peace bestowed by the LORD.","Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD."
1 Kings,21,34,"Then Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, went up and took him out, killing him. They buried him in his own crib out in the middle of nowhere.","So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness."
1 Kings,21,35,"The king chose Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, to take charge of his army, and Zadok the priest replaced Abiathar.",And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
1 Kings,21,36,"So the king reached out to Shimei and was like, 'Yo bro, go ahead and build yourself a sick pad in Jerusalem. Settle down there and don't even think about bouncing out.'","And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither."
1 Kings,21,37,"Listen up, when you leave and cross over the Kidron brook, you better believe you're heading straight for doom. Your own blood will be on your hands, no doubt about it.","For it shall be, {that} on the day thou goest out, and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head."
1 Kings,21,38,"Shimei was like, 'Yo, the king's words are straight fire. Whatever my lord the king commanded, your boy Shimei got you. And Shimei chilled in Jerusalem for a hot minute.","And Shimei said unto the king, The saying {is} good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days."
1 Kings,21,39,"So, after three years, two of Shimei's servants decided to dip and bounced to Achish, son of Maachah, the king of Gath. They hit up Shimei like, 'Yo, bro, guess where your servants are? Gath, man!'","And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants {be} in Gath."
1 Kings,21,40,"So Shimei got up and hopped on his ride, headed to Gath to find his crew. Shimei went, and managed to bring his squad back from Gath.","And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath."
1 Kings,21,41,"So, like, word got to Solomon that Shimei, you know, had dipped from Jerusalem to Gath and then pulled a U-turn.","And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again."
1 Kings,21,42,"So the king texts Shimei and says, 'Bro, remember when I made you swear by the LORD and warned you that if you ever leave or go anywhere, you'll definitely die? And you were like, 'Yeah man, I got it, the word I heard sounds good'.","And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word {that} I have heard {is} good."
1 Kings,21,43,"So like, why didn't you keep your promise to the LORD and do what I told you to?","Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?"
1 Kings,21,44,"The king straight up told Shimei, like, you know all the messed up stuff you did to my dad David, right? Well, let me break it down for you: God's gonna totally make you pay for all your wickedness, like, it's gonna come back and bite you in the end, man.","The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head;"
1 Kings,21,45,"King Solomon gonna be blessed, and David's throne gonna stay strong in front of the LORD forever.","And king Solomon {shall be} blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever."
1 Kings,21,46,"Then the king told Benaiah, Jehoiada's son, to go and take care of him. Benaiah did as he was told and ended up finishing the guy off, so he kicked the bucket. And that's how Solomon became the boss of the kingdom.","So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon."
2 Kings,11,2,"So Ahaziah was hanging out in his chill chamber in Samaria when he fell through a lattice and got sick, bummer. He was like, 'Yo messengers, go ask Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, if I'm gonna bounce back from this sickness'.","And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that {was} in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease."
2 Kings,11,3,"But this super chill angel dude was like, 'Yo, Elijah the Tishbite, get up and meet the squad sent by the king of Samaria. Tell them straight up, don't you realize there's a legit God in Israel? Why are you even bothering to ask Baalzebub, the god of Ekron?'","But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, {Is it} not because {there is} not a God in Israel, {that} ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?"
2 Kings,11,4,"So, like, God was like, 'Yo, listen up! You can't get off that bed you went on, or else you're gonna die. Bye, Elijah!","Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed. {Thou shalt...: Heb. The bed whither thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from it}"
2 Kings,11,5,"And when the messengers came back to him, he asked them, why did y'all go and come back?","And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?"
2 Kings,11,6,"So, they told him this story: Some dude came up to us and said, 'Yo, go back to the king who sent you and deliver this message to him. The LORD asks, 'Why are you seeking guidance from Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, when you know there's a God in Israel?' So basically, the LORD is saying you won't be leaving that bed you climbed onto. You're gonna die for sure, man.","And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, {Is it} not because {there is} not a God in Israel, {that} thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die."
2 Kings,11,7,"And he's like, yo, dudes, who was that guy who came up to you and told you this stuff? What did he look like and all? Like, what's the deal with him?","And he said unto them, What manner of man {was he} which came up to meet you, and told you these words? {What...: Heb. What was the manner of the man}"
2 Kings,11,8,"And they were like, yo, he had a serious mane, and had this wicked leather belt around his waist. And this dude was like, 'Yo, that's Elijah the Tishbite!'","And they answered him, {He was} an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It {is} Elijah the Tishbite."
2 Kings,11,9,"So the king sent a squad of 50 with their leader. They approached the man of God who was chilling up on a hill. The leader called out to him, saying, 'Hey, holy dude! The king wants you to come down.'","Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down."
2 Kings,11,10,"'Yo, so Elijah straight up responds to the captain of fifty like, 'If I'm really a man of God, then bring on that fire from heaven and let it wreck you and your whole squad.' And guess what? That fire actually came down from heaven and totally burned them all up.","And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I {be} a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,11,11,"Then he sent another group of soldiers, about fifty of them along with their captain. The captain respectfully approached the man of God and said, 'Hey, the king wants you to come down right away.'","Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly."
2 Kings,11,12,"And Elijah was like, yo, if I'm really a man of God, then let fire rain down from heaven and wipe out you and your whole squad. And sure enough, boom! God's fire came down and totally roasted them all.","And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I {be} a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty."
2 Kings,11,13,"Then he sent another captain with his group of fifty. The captain approached Elijah, went down on his knees, and earnestly pleaded, saying, 'Oh, man of God, I humbly ask that you value not only my life but also the lives of these fifty servants of yours.'","And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. {fell: Heb. bowed}"
2 Kings,11,14,"Yo, check it out, fire straight up rained down from the sky and totally roasted those two leaders and their crews. So, like, can you please consider my life valuable now?","Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight."
2 Kings,11,15,"And the angel of the LORD was like, 'Yo Elijah, go down with him, don't be scared, bro.' So Elijah was like, 'Alright, bet,' and went down with him to the king.","And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him unto the king."
2 Kings,11,16,"And he was like, 'Yo, listen up! The LORD has something to say. So, you sent your boys to ask Baalzebub, the so-called god of Ekron, if it's because you think there's no God in Israel who can answer your questions? Well, I got news for you, bro. Since you did that, you ain't getting off that bed you climbed onto, and you're gonna die for sure.'","And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, {is it} not because {there is} no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die."
2 Kings,11,17,"And just as the LORD had said through Elijah, he passed away. Then Jehoram took over as king in the second year of Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, since he didn't have any sons.",So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.
2 Kings,11,18,"Yo, all the other stuff Ahaziah did, isn't it all written down in that book about the Kings of Israel?","Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, {are} they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?"
2 Kings,21,2,"And Elijah was like, yo Elisha, just chill here for a sec because the big man upstairs sent me to Bethel. And Elisha was like, swear on the Lord and swear on your own life, I'm not ditching you. So they both rolled down to Bethel.","And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said {unto him, As} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel."
2 Kings,21,3,"So, like, these guys who were training to be prophets at Bethel came up to Elisha and said, 'Yo dude, do you know that the LORD is gonna snatch your teacher away from you today?' And Elisha was like, 'Yeah man, I'm aware, so just chill and keep quiet about it, okay?'","And the sons of the prophets that {were} at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know {it}; hold ye your peace."
2 Kings,21,4,"And Elijah was like, 'Yo Elisha, chill here for a sec, 'cause the LORD sent me to Jericho.' And Elisha was like, 'Swear, man! I ain't ditching you, not even if my life depended on it!' So they rolled up to Jericho together.","And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho."
2 Kings,21,5,"So, like, the prophets' guys in Jericho went up to Elisha and were all, 'Hey, do you know that the LORD is gonna take your boss away from you today?' And Elisha was like, 'Yeah, I'm totally aware of that, so just chill and keep quiet, okay?'}","And the sons of the prophets that {were} at Jericho came to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know {it}; hold ye your peace."
2 Kings,21,6,"And Elijah was like, 'Yo, dude, chill here for a bit, 'cause the LORD hooked me up to go to the Jordan river.' And the other guy was like, 'OMG, swear on the LORD and your life, I'm not gonna leave you!' So they both kept going together, no doubt.","And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, {As} the LORD liveth, and {as} thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on."
2 Kings,21,7,"Fifty dudes from the sons of the prophets went over there and took a chill spot to scope things out from a distance, while these two just kicked it by the Jordan river.","And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. {to view: Heb. in sight, or, over against}"
2 Kings,21,8,"Then Elijah grabbed his cloak and wrapped it up.

So he sent them to get sanctified, and woke up super early the next day to offer burnt offerings for each one of them.

Thus did Job continually. {continually: Heb. all the days}"
Job,11,6,"So, like, one day the squad of heaven's fam came to chill with the big man upstairs, and even Satan showed up with them.

Job,11,8,"So, God was like, yo Satan, have you ever checked out Job? He's seriously one of a kind on this planet, a total legend. He's a stand-up guy who respects God and avoids anything sketchy. Have you even given him any thought?","And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that {there is} none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? {considered: Heb. set thy heart on}"
Job,11,9,"And then Satan, like, replied to the LORD, and was like, 'Does Job just praise God for nothing?'","Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?"
Job,11,10,"Like, haven't you totally like put up a protective shield around him and his crib and all his stuff?

Job,11,12,"And God was like, 'Yo Satan, check it out. Everything this guy has is in your control, but don't mess with him personally, okay?'

(By the way, the Hebrew word for 'control' here is handd'.)","And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath {is} in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand.

Job,21,3,"And God was like, 'Yo Satan, have you seen my guy Job? He's like one in a million, a straight-up legend. He's always repping me, avoiding all the bad stuff, and keeping it real. Even though you tried to mess him up for no reason, he's still holding it down and staying true to himself.'","And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that {there is} none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause. {to destroy...: Heb. to swallow him up}"

Job,21,11,"So, like, when Job's three friends caught wind of all the terrible stuff that happened to him, they all rolled up from their own hood. We got Eliphaz from Teman, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar from Naamath. They had actually planned to meet up and support Job through his tough times.","Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him."
Job,21,12,"And when they looked from a distance and didn't recognize him, they cried out loud and started crying.

Ezekiel,31,3,"And he was like, 'Yo, dude, eat up and fill your stomach with this scroll I'm giving you.' So I digested it, and bro, it tasted so sweet, like honey in my mouth.","And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat {it}; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness."
Ezekiel,31,4,"So, like, He said to me, 'Yo, dude! Go to the house of Israel and, like, speak my words to them, you know.'","And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them."
Ezekiel,31,5,"Like, you're not being sent to some random people who speak differently and have a hard-to-understand slang. Nope, you're specifically sent to the Israelites - they might have a unique way of speaking, with their deep lip vibes and heavy tongue action. So, go connect with your peeps!","For thou {art} not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, {but} to the house of Israel; {of a...: Heb. deep of lip, and heavy of tongue}"
Ezekiel,31,6,"Don't stress about chatting with people who speak differently and use lingo you're not familiar with. Trust me, if I had sent you to them, they would have totally understood you.","Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee. {of a...: Heb. deep of lip, and heavy of language} {Surely...: or, If I had sent thee, etc. would they not have hearkened unto thee?}"
Ezekiel,31,7,"But the Israelites ain't gonna listen to you, 'cause they don't listen to me either. They're all stubborn and closed-minded. Like, seriously, they've got hard foreheads and hard hearts.","But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel {are} impudent and hardhearted. {impudent...: Heb. stiff of forehead, and hard of heart}"
Ezekiel,31,8,"Yo, I've equipped you with an unbeatable confidence to face anyone head-on without flinching.","Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads."
Ezekiel,31,9,"I've made you as strong as a stubborn rock, with a fierce attitude. Don't sweat those haters or get freaked out by their stares, even if they're a bunch of rebels.","As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they {be} a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,31,10,"And then he was like, yo, listen up, dude. Take all the stuff I'm about to tell you and really get it in your heart, you know? Open up your ears and fully hear what I'm saying.","Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears."
Ezekiel,31,11,"Yo, go and find those who are locked up, the peeps from your own crew, and reach out to them. Talk to them and let 'em know what's up, cos this is straight from the Lord GOD—whether they wanna listen up or ignore it, that's on them.","And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear."
Ezekiel,31,12,"And then, like, I was totally lifted up by this amazing spiritual vibe, and like, I heard this voice from behind me that was, like, super intense. It was all, 'Yo, the glory of the LORD be totally blessed from wherever He is at, ya know?'","Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, {saying}, Blessed {be} the glory of the LORD from his place."
Ezekiel,31,13,"Yo, I totally heard the epic sound of those living creatures' wings bumping into each other, and the wheels making a sick noise right next to them, like a super intense rush!","{I heard} also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing. {touched: Heb. kissed}"
Ezekiel,31,14,"Alright, listen up - something crazy happened. Suddenly, I felt this intense energy lifting me up, taking me away. Let me tell you, I was beyond frustrated, full of fiery anger, but man, the power of the LORD was totally overwhelming me. You can't even imagine!","So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me. {in bitterness: Heb. bitter} {heat: Heb. hot anger}"
Ezekiel,31,15,"So, I went to the TikTok fam in Telabib, who were chilling by the river of Chebar. I sat down right where they were sitting and spent a whole week being totally mind-blown with them.","Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days."
Ezekiel,31,16,"So, after like a whole week, the LORD hit me up with a message, you know what He said?","And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,"
Ezekiel,31,17,"Yo, bro, listen up! I've chosen you to be like a lookout for the peeps of Israel. So, pay attention to what I gotta say and give 'em a heads up from me!","Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me."
Ezekiel,31,18,"When I tell those who are being wicked, 'You're definitely gonna meet your end,' and you don't bother to give them a heads up or warn them about their wicked ways to help save their lives, that wicked person is gonna die because of their own evil. But I'm gonna hold you accountable for not saying something.","When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked {man} shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand."
Ezekiel,31,19,"But like, if you call out someone who's doing wrong and they don't change their ways, they'll suffer the consequences for their actions. But hey, at least you did your part and saved yourself from any guilt.","Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul."
Ezekiel,31,20,"Yo, listen up. If a righteous person decides to ditch their righteous ways and starts doing messed up stuff, and I put obstacles in their path, they're gonna pay the price. See, you didn't even try to warn them, so they're gonna die with all their sins weighing them down. And hey, all the good they've done in the past? It won't even matter. But guess what? I'm gonna hold you accountable for their blood on your hands, bro. Just saying.","Again, When a righteous {man} doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thine hand. {righteousness which: Heb. righteousnesses}"
Ezekiel,31,21,"But hey, here's the deal: if you give a heads up to someone who's already doing the right thing, making sure they don't mess up, and they actually don't mess up, they'll keep on living their best life. You know why? Because you helped them out! And bonus, you saved yourself too.","Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous {man}, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul."
Ezekiel,31,22,"Then God's power was upon me, and he said to me, 'Get up, go out into the open area, and I'll talk with you there.'","And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee."
Ezekiel,31,23,"So, I got up and headed out into the open space, and BAM, God's amazing presence was right there, just like how I saw His incredible glory by the river of Chebar. And man, I couldn't help but bow down with my face on the ground.","Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face."
Ezekiel,31,24,"And suddenly, a mood came over me. It lifted me up and started chatting with me, telling me to go and lock myself in my crib.","Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house."
Ezekiel,31,25,"Yo, dude, listen up! You, as a son of man, gotta pay attention 'cause they gonna slap those handcuffs on you, tie you up real tight, and keep you from stepping out into their territory.","But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:"
Ezekiel,31,26,"And I'm gonna make your mouth stick to the roof, so you won't be able to speak and school those rebellious peeps. They don't want no advice from you, fam.","And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they {are} a rebellious house. {a reprover: Heb. a man reproving}"
Ezekiel,31,27,"Yo, when I'm talking to you, I'll make it so you can speak your mind, and you gotta tell 'em like this, Godd says this: If someone's listening, they better really listen, and if someone's not into it, they can just back off. 'Cause those peeps are straight up rebellious.","But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they {are} a rebellious house."
Ezekiel,41,2,"Like, surround the place, build a sick fortress, and put up big ramps. Set up the whole crew around it and bring in some heavy artillery. They're like the boss leaders or something!","And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set {battering} rams against it round about. {battering...: chief leaders}"
Ezekiel,41,3,"Yo, grab an iron pan and use it like a solid wall between you and the city. Face it head-on and start a siege against it. This is gonna be a sign for the house of Israel. Just sayin'!","Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it {for} a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This {shall be} a sign to the house of Israel. {an...: or, a flat plate, or, slice}"
Ezekiel,41,4,"Just chill on your left side and take on all the bad stuff that the people of Israel have done. You gotta do this for as many days as you lie on your side, and that's how you'll carry their wrongdoings.","Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: {according} to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity."
Ezekiel,41,5,"I'm gonna make you carry the weight of their wrongdoing for a long time, exactly 390 days. You'll be responsible for the sins of the people of Israel, like a massive burden on your shoulders.","For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel."
Ezekiel,41,6,"And once you've finished doing that, lie on your right side again. You'll take on the consequences of the wrongdoing of the house of Judah for forty days. Each day represents a year. It's like a day standing for a whole year.","And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year. {each...: Heb. a day for a year, a day for a year}"
Ezekiel,41,7,"So, like, you gotta like, totally focus on, like, the whole situation with Jerusalem and stuff. And you gotta like, bare your arm or whatever, and speak out against it, you know?","Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm {shall be} uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it."
Ezekiel,41,8,"Yo, check this out: I'm gonna restrict your movement, like putting bands on you, so you can't even flip over until you've survived the entire duration of being under siege. (By the way, 'from one side to another' means you can't twist or turn around.)","And, behold, I will lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege. {from one...: Heb. from thy side to thy side}"
Ezekiel,41,9,"Yo, grab some wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt. Mix 'em all up in one container and make some bread out of it. You gotta eat this bread for 390 days, while you're chilling on your side. No cheating!","Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof, {according} to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof. {fitches: or, spelt}"
Ezekiel,41,10,"And the food you'll eat will be carefully portioned, like twenty shekels a day, not more. Stick to the plan and eat it at regular intervals.","And thy meat which thou shalt eat {shall be} by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it."
Ezekiel,41,11,"You gotta stick to a specific water ration, like only a sixth of a hin. Make sure to hydrate regularly too!","Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink."
Ezekiel,41,12,"And you should eat it like barley cakes, and bake it using manure in front of them.","And thou shalt eat it {as} barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight."
Ezekiel,41,13,"God was like, 'Yo, listen up. The Israelites gotta eat their messed up food while they're living among the non-Israelite people that I'll be sending them to.'","And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will drive them."
Ezekiel,41,14,"I was like, 'Yo, Lord GOD!' Listen up, my soul has not been defiled. Since I was young till now, I've never eaten any dead or torn-up animals, and I haven't put any nasty, disgusting meat in my mouth.","Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth."
Ezekiel,41,15,"And he's like, yo, I hooked you up with cow's dung instead of human dung, so you can use it to bake your bread, man!","Then he said unto me, Lo, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith."
Ezekiel,41,16,"Yo, he was like, 'Listen up, dude. Imma mess up the whole bread situation in Jerusalem. They gonna eat bread but in limited portions and with stress. And when they drink water, it's gonna be all measured out and they gonna be shook.'","Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:"
Ezekiel,41,17,"So, like, they're gonna be all, like, craving for bread and water, and they'll be, like, super shocked and amazed by what's happening, and, you know, they'll just suffer the consequences of their bad choices and stuff, like, totally.","That they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and consume away for their iniquity."
Daniel,11,2,"So, like, God totally let this dude named Jehoiakim, who was the king of Judah, get captured. And not only that, but he also allowed some of the holy stuff from the house of God to be taken away. This guy took the holy stuff and brought it to Shinar to place it in his own god's house. And yeah, he just stored those treasures in there.","And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god."
Daniel,11,3,"So the king talked to Ashpenaz, the head of his servants, and told him to select some of the Israelite kids, as well as some from the royal family and the high-ranking officials.","And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring {certain} of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes;"
Daniel,11,4,"These kids were flawless, good-looking, super smart, and knowledgeable in all subjects. They were total geniuses, experts in everything from science to linguistics. They were perfect candidates to be the king's right-hand people, ready to learn anything and everything about the Chaldeans.","Children in whom {was} no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as {had} ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans."
Daniel,11,5,"The king hooked them up with his fancy food and drink every day for three years, to make sure they were well-fed and could impress the king later on.","And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king. {the wine...: Heb. the wine of his drink}"
Daniel,11,6,"So, like, among these group of peeps, there were four homies from the tribe of Judah named Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:","Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:"
Daniel,11,7,"So the prince in charge of them picked new names for them: Daniel became Belteshazzar, Hananiah became Shadrach, Mishael became Meshach, and Azariah became Abednego.","Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel {the name} of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego."
Daniel,11,8,"But Daniel was like, 'Nah, I'm not about to ruin my vibes with that fancy food and wine from the king.' So, he asked the eunuch in charge if he could skip it and stay true to himself.","But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself."
Daniel,11,9,"So, like, God totally made Daniel super popular and tight with the prince of the eunuchs. No cap!",Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.
Daniel,11,10,"Yo, the manager dude said to Daniel: I'm low-key scared of the king, man. He's the one who decides what you eat and drink. Like, if he sees you looking all sad and down while the other kids your age are all hyped, I'm gonna be in major trouble with the king. Can't let that happen, bro.","And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which {are} of your sort? then shall ye make {me} endanger my head to the king. {worse...: Heb. sadder} {sort: or, term, or, continuance?}"
Daniel,11,11,"So Daniel spoke to Melzar, the person in charge appointed by the prince of the eunuchs, who was responsible for Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, yo!","Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, {Melzar: or, the steward}"
Daniel,11,12,"Yo, hear me out, boss. How 'bout we put it to the test? Give your servants just ten days, and hook us up with some plant-based grub and H2O. You feel me?","Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. {pulse: Heb. of pulse} {to eat...: Heb. that we may eat, etc}"
Daniel,11,13,"Yo, check out our faces and the faces of the homies who dig into the king's grub. Do what you gotta do, fam.","Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants."
Daniel,11,14,"So he was like, 'Sure, I'm down with that,' and decided to test them for ten days.","So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days."
Daniel,11,15,"After ten days, they looked way more awesome and totally had a glow-up compared to all the other kids who ate the fancy food from the king.",And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat.
Daniel,11,16,"So Melzar took away their main dish and their fancy drinks, and gave them some simple plant-based food instead.","Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse."
Daniel,11,17,"Yo, these four kids? God hooked them up with mad knowledge and skills in all kinds of learning and wisdom. And check it, Daniel was on another level, he understood all those crazy visions and dreams, man.","As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. {Daniel...: or, he made Daniel understand}"
Daniel,11,18,"So, when the time was up and the king wanted them to come, the cool dude in charge of the eunuchs brought them before Nebuchadnezzar.","Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar."
Daniel,11,19,"So, the king had a chat with them all, and out of everyone, he couldn't find anyone as awesome as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. That's why they totally scored a VIP spot in front of the king.","And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king."
Daniel,11,20,"And like, in every aspect of being super smart and all, when the king asked them for advice, he discovered that they were, like, ten times better than all the magicians and fortune tellers in the whole kingdom. It was, like, their epic wisdom and deep understanding, you know!","And in all matters of wisdom {and} understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians {and} astrologers that {were} in all his realm. {wisdom...: Heb. wisdom of understanding}"

Because the people in this land have totally ditched the LORD and gone astray.'","The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea.

Hosea,11,6,"Then she got pregnant again and gave birth to a baby girl. And {God} told him, name her Loruhamah: because I'm not gonna show any more mercy to the people of Israel; I'm gonna completely get rid of them. {Loruhamah: which means, Not receiving mercy} {no...: in Hebrew, it means no more} {but...: or, for me to forgive them completely}","And she conceived again, and bare a daughter.

Zechariah,11,11,"So, like, they were all talking to the angel of the LORD who was just chilling among the myrtle trees, and they were like, 'Dude, we've totally been roaming around the earth, and guess what? The whole earth is just, like, super calm and peaceful right now.'","And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest."
Zechariah,11,12,"And the angel of the LORD was like, yo O LORD, how much longer you gonna be tough on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah? You've been mad at them for like seventy years, man!","Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?"
Zechariah,11,13,And God replied to the angel I was talking to with kind and reassuring words.,And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me {with} good words {and} comfortable words.
Zechariah,11,14,"So the angel was like, 'Yo, listen up! Tell everyone this message from the LORD of all: I'm totally, like, super protective over Jerusalem and Zion and I'm, like, crazy passionate about it.'","So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy."
Zechariah,11,15,"And I'm super mad at those clueless peeps who are living it up without a care. I was only a little mad, and they totally made the situation worse.","And I am very sore displeased with the heathen {that are} at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction."
Zechariah,11,16,"So, here's the deal: God's like, 'Listen up! I'm back in Jerusalem, ready to show some mad love and kindness. My crib is gonna be rebuilt, you dig? The LORD almighty said it, so you know it's legit. And get this, a fresh and straight-up line is gonna be drawn all over Jerusalem.'","Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem."
Zechariah,11,17,"Yo, listen up! The LORD of hosts is like, 'Yo, don't even trip. My cities are gonna thrive and spread big time. And fosho, the LORD's gonna bring the comfort to Zion and be all about choosing Jerusalem.

Zechariah,11,18,"So I looked up and saw this crazy sight, there were these four horns. Like, what even?!","Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns."
Zechariah,11,19,"So I asked the angel chillin' by my side, 'Yo, what's up with these things?' And the angel goes, 'These are the horns that messed up Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.'","And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What {be} these? And he answered me, These {are} the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem."
Zechariah,11,20,"So like, God totally showed me these four super skilled carpenters, you guys.",And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.
Zechariah,11,21,"I was like, yo, what's the deal with these horns? And then he was like, listen up, these horns are the ones that messed up Judah, making everyone feel down. But guess what? These horns are here to scare them off, to kick out those other horns from foreign folks who tried to mess with Judah and make it all chaotic.","Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These {are} the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up {their} horn over the land of Judah to scatter it."

Cool, right?","And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way."

'Cause Herod is gonna try to search for the little one and harm him.'","And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him."

Mark,11,10,"As soon as he got out of the water, he saw the heavens crack wide open, and the Spirit came down on him like a dove: {opened: or, split, or, torn apart}","And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him: {opened: or, cloven, or, rent}"

Mark,11,22,"And they were shook by his teaching, 'cause he dropped knowledge like a boss, not all boring and traditional like the religious peeps.","And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes."
Mark,11,23,"So, like, there was this guy at the synagogue who had, like, a really bad spirit inside him, and he started screaming,","And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,"
Mark,11,24,"They were like, 'Leave us alone, Jesus of Nazareth! What do we have to do with you? Are you here to wreck us?

Mark,11,26,"And like, this totally wicked spirit was like tearing him apart, and then it like screamed super loudly and bounced out of him.","And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him."
Mark,11,27,"And everyone was totally shook, like seriously questioning each other, like, What is happening here? What new vibes is this? Like, this dude has such mad authority that even the evil spirits obey him.","And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine {is} this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him."
Mark,11,28,"And like, word got out super fast about this dude in Galilee. Everyone around there was talking about him, no cap.",And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
Mark,11,29,"And right after they finished up at the synagogue, they headed over to Simon and Andrew's crib, along with James and John.","And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John."
Mark,11,30,"So, basically, Simon's mother-in-law was really sick with a fever and they immediately let him know about it.","But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her."

Mark,11,34,"And he like, totally made a bunch of sick people better, you know, those peeps with all sorts of different diseases. Also, he straight up kicked out a bunch of devils. And not gonna lie, he shut those devils up real quick because they recognized him and he wasn't about that. Like, nah, no talking for you, demons!","And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him. {to speak...: or, to say that they knew him}"
Mark,11,35,"Early in the morning, way before the sun was up, he bounced outta there and headed to a chill spot all by himself to have a super deep prayer sesh.","And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed."
Mark,11,36,So Simon and his crew straight up chased after him.,And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.
Mark,11,37,"And when they finally tracked him down, they were like, 'Dude, everyone is looking for you!'","And when they had found him, they said unto him, All {men} seek for thee."

Do all the cleansing stuff Moses told you to do, you know, for them to have proof and stuff.","And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them."
Mark,11,45,"But he dipped out and straight flexed, spreading the word big time, so much so that Jesus couldn't even slide into the city without getting mobbed. He had to chill out in the wilderness, but people still came to him from all over the place.","But he went out, and began to publish {it} much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter."
Luke,11,2,"Just like how they passed it down to us, the ones who saw everything firsthand and spread the message.","Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;"
Luke,11,3,"Yo, I thought it'd be cool to drop you a message, Theophilus, after fully grasping everything from the start. Gonna keep it organized and straight-up with you, my dude.","It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,"

John,11,4,"He was full of life, and that life brought light to everyone.",In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
John,11,5,"So, like, the light was shining in the darkness, but the darkness totally didn't get it. Like, didn't even try to understand or accept it or anything, you know?","And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. {comprehended: or, did not admit, or, receive}"
John,11,6,"So, like, there was this dude straight up sent by God, and his name was John, you know?","There was a man sent from God, whose name {was} John."
John,11,7,"Yo, this person showed up to be a witness and testify about the Light, so that everyone could believe because of him.","The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all {men} through him might believe."

John,11,9,"Yo, that was the legit Light, shining on everyone who enters this world.","{That} was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world."
John,11,10,"So, like, he was totally in the world, right? And, get this, the world was, like, totally created by him, but the world didn't even recognize him, you know?","He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not."
John,11,11,"He came to his fam, but they didn't vibe with him.","He came unto his own, and his own received him not."
John,11,12,"But all those who accepted him, he empowered them to become children of God, to those who trusted in his name. Powerr here means authority or privilege)","But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, {even} to them that believe on his name: {power: or, the right, or, privilege}"
John,11,13,"They were born, not because of their lineage, or the desires of their physical bodies, or human desires, but because of God.","Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God."
John,11,14,"And the Word became a human and hung out with us (and we saw how awesome he was, like the one and only child of the Dad), super cool and authentic.","And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."
John,11,15,"John totally vouched for him, and was like, yo listen up, this is the dude I was talking about. The one who comes after me is actually way more lit than me, 'cause he existed before me.","John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."
John,11,16,"And we've all been blessed with everything from his overflow, receiving grace on top of grace.","And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace."
John,11,17,"Yo, the rules were dropped by Moses, but Jesus Christ came through with that grace and truth vibe.","For the law was given by Moses, {but} grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
John,11,18,"No cap, nobody has ever clapped eyes on God; the one and only Son, chillin' in the Father's crib, is the real deal who brought the scoop on him.","No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared {him}."
John,11,19,"So, here's the tea about John. The Jews were all up in his DMs, sending priests and Levites from Jerusalem to slide into his inbox and ask him, 'Bruh, who do you think you are?'","And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?"
John,11,20,"And he straight up admitted it, no cap; he didn't try to hide it, but straight up said, 'I ain't the Christ'.","And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ."
John,11,21,"They were like, 'So, are you Elias?' And he's like, 'Nah, not me.' Then they're like, 'Are you that prophet?' And he's like, 'Nah, not that either.'","And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. {that prophet: or, a prophet?}"
John,11,22,"They asked him, 'Who are you? So we can tell those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?'","Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?"
John,11,23,"Yo, I'm out here yellin' in the middle of nowhere, telling y'all to prepare the way for the Lord, just like that prophet dude Isaiah said.","He said, I {am} the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias."
John,11,24,"And the peeps who got sent were, like, Pharisees or something.",And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
John,11,25,"And they were like, yo, they asked him this, like, 'Why you baptizing people if you not the Christ, or Elias, or that prophet? Like, what's up with that?'","And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?"
John,11,26,"Yo, John here. Just to clarify, I'm all about that water baptism. But, check it, there's someone hangin' with y'all that you totally don't recognize.","John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;"
John,11,27,"He's the one who's gonna blow up after me, like way more famous than me. I don't even deserve to touch his sneakers, like not even worthy enough to untie the laces.","He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose."
John,11,28,"These awesome things went down in Bethabara, like way out in Jordan, where John was doing his baptism thing.","These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing."
John,11,29,"The next day, John sees Jesus approaching him and says, 'Check it out, here comes the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the whole world.'","The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. {taketh away: or, beareth}"
John,11,30,"Yo, remember when I told y'all about this dude who's gonna come after me but is actually way cooler than me? Yeah, turns out he existed even before I did. Can't deny the facts!","This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me."
John,11,31,"And I didn't really know him at first, but I'm here to show him to the people of Israel, which is why I'm doing this water dunking thing.","And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water."
John,11,32,"So, John saw this epic moment and was like, yo, I witnessed the Spirit straight-up coming down from heaven, looking all peaceful like a dove, and just chilling on Jesus.","And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him."
John,11,33,"And yo, I was clueless, didn't even recognize him. But the dude who sent me to splash people with water, he straight up told me that when I see the Spirit coming down and chilling on someone, that's the one who's all about baptizing with the Holy Ghost.","And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."
John,11,34,"Yo, I was peepin' and I gotta say, this dude right here? He's totally the Son of God, no cap.","And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God."
John,11,35,"The next day, John was just chilling, and two of his homies rolled up;","Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;"
John,11,36,"Yo, check out Jesus strolling by, he's the legit Lamb of God!","And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!"
John,11,37,"And the two disciples were totally vibing with what he was saying, so they started rollin' with Jesus.","And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus."
John,11,38,"So Jesus looked back and noticed them tagging along. He asked them, 'What's up? What are you looking for?' They replied to him, 'Yo, Rabbi! (That means 'Master' for all you cool kids.) Where you chilling at these days?' {dwellest: or, abidest}","Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou? {dwellest: or, abidest}"
John,11,39,"He's like, 'Yo, come check this out.' So they went and saw where he was chilling, and they hung with him for the whole day, it was like around 10pm. (That's like two hours before night, FYI.)","He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour. {about...: that was two hours before night}"
John,11,40,"One of the two dudes who heard John talking and started hanging with him was Andrew, Simon Peter's bro.","One of the two which heard John {speak}, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother."
John,11,41,"He looks for his bro Simon and says, 'Yo, guess what? We found the Messias. That's like, the Christ, you know? But like, the Anointed too.'","He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. {the Christ: or, the Anointed}"
John,11,42,"So he takes him to Jesus. And when Jesus sees him, he says, 'You're Simon, son of Jona. But from now on, you're gonna be called Cephas, which means 'A stone'.","And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone."
John,11,43,"The next day, Jesus was like, 'Yo, let's head to Galilee!' And he comes across Philip and straight up says, 'Dude, come follow me!'","The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me."
John,11,44,"So like, Philip was from Bethsaida, which is where Andrew and Peter came from.","Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter."
John,11,45,"Philip saw Nathanael and was like, 'Dude, we totally found the guy Moses and the prophets talked about in the law—Jesus of Nazareth, Joseph's son!'","Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
John,11,46,"So, Nathanael was like, 'Can anything great even come out of Nazareth?' And Philip was like, 'Dude, just come and see for yourself.'","And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see."
John,11,47,"When Jesus spotted Nathanael approaching, he was like, 'Yo, check out this legit Israelite, no cap, dude's totally real!'","Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"
John,11,48,"Nathanael's like, yo, how do you know me? Jesus be like, don't trip, bro. I saw you chilling under that fig tree even before Philip hit you up.","Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee."
John,11,49,"Nathanael replied and said to him, Yo, Rabbi, you're like the ultimate Son of God, the real deal King of Israel.","Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel."
John,11,50,"Jesus replied and said to him, 'Just because I told you that I saw you hanging out under the fig tree, do you actually believe that? Get ready to witness even more mind-blowing stuff!'","Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these."
John,11,51,"And he's like, seriously, listen up, I'm telling you, in the future, you'll witness heaven straight up opening, and angels going up and down on the Son of man.","And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."
John,21,2,So Jesus and his squad were invited to the lit wedding!,"And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage."
John,21,3,"So, like, they're all out of wine, right? And Jesus' mom is just like, 'Hey, Jesus, they're totally out of wine!'","And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine."
John,21,4,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, why you trippin', woman? It ain't my time yet.'","Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come."
John,21,5,"His mom told the squad, whatever he tells you to do, just do it.","His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do {it}."
John,21,6,"There were like six stone water containers there, the kind the Jews used for purifying, holding like two or three big jugs each.","And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece."
John,21,7,"Jesus was like, 'Yo, fill up those waterpots with water, fam.' And they filled them up all the way to the top.","Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim."
John,21,8,"And he's like, yo guys, bring it over to the party boss. So they brought it, no cap.","And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare {it}."
John,21,9,"When the party boss took a sip of the water-turned-wine and didn't know where it came from (but the crew who poured the water did), the party manager called the groom.","When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,"
John,21,10,"And he's like, bro, usually everyone starts with the good stuff, you know, top-tier wine. But once people are already pretty wasted, they bring out the cheap stuff. But you, man, you saved the best for last. That's lit!","And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: {but} thou hast kept the good wine until now."
John,21,11,"Yo, this was when Jesus first started showing mad miracles in Cana of Galilee, straight up revealing His power and His disciples became true believers.","This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him."
John,21,12,"Then, like, he went to Capernaum with his fam and squad, including his mom, siblings, and followers. They chilled there for a bit, but didn't stay long, you know?","After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days."
John,21,13,"So it was almost time for the Jewish peeps' Passover, and Jesus rolled up to Jerusalem like a boss,","And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,"
John,21,14,"So, Jesus goes into the temple and sees these people selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and others exchanging money while lounging around:","And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:"
John,21,15,"Then he grabbed some cords and made a whip out of them. He straight-up kicked everyone, including the sheep and the oxen, out of the temple. He flipped the tables and straight-up dumped out all the money from the money changers.","And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;"
John,21,16,"And he told the people selling doves, 'Move these things out of here; don't turn my Father's house into a retail store.'","And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise."
John,21,17,"And Jesus' squad was like, yo, don't forget it was written, I'm all about that holy life and it's totally consuming me.","And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up."
John,21,18,"The Jews were like, 'Yo, what's your deal, man? Can you show us some proof for all the stuff you're doing?'","Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?"
John,21,19,"Jesus straight up replied to them, yo, wreck this temple, and I'll straight up rebuild it in just three days.","Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
John,21,20,"So, like, the Jews were all, dude, this temple took forty-six whole years to build, and now you're saying you'll reconstruct it in just three days? Seriously?","Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?"
John,21,21,"But he was talking about his body, like, the temple.",But he spake of the temple of his body.
John,21,22,"So, like, when Jesus came back to life, his squad totally remembered that he had already told them this. They trusted what was written in Scripture and everything that Jesus had said.","When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said."
John,21,23,"So like, when he was chilling in Jerusalem during passover, at this big feast day, a lot of people started vibing with him and believing in his name, once they saw all the lit miracles he was pulling off.","Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast {day}, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did."

Acts,11,3,"And he totally proved that he was alive after everything he went through, with like, tons of undeniable evidence.

Acts,11,4,"So, when they were all together, He told them not to leave Jerusalem but to wait for the Father's promise, which He had spoken to them about before.","And, being assembled together with {them}, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, {saith he}, ye have heard of me. {being...: or, eating together}"

Romans,11,21,"Yo, listen up. Back in the day, when they knew God, they didn't give props to Him like they should've, and they totally forgot to be grateful.

Romans,11,29,"Like, they were just full of all this uncool stuff, ya know? Like, doing things they shouldn't be doing, and being totally wicked, greedy, and all mean and stuff. They were just oozing with jealousy, literally killing each other with their words, and always causing drama, lying, and being super shady. Oh, and they couldn't stop gossiping, it was like their favorite hobby or something.","Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,"
Romans,11,30,"People who talk behind others' backs, hate on God, spread negativity, act arrogant, boast about themselves, come up with wicked ideas, and disobey their parents,","Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"

1 Corinthians,11,10,"Listen up, fam! I'm here to ask y'all, my brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to be on the same page and avoid any drama. Let's stay united and have a solid bond, thinking and making decisions together as one. No room for splits or disagreements, ya dig? (Note: 'divisions' means 'schisms', just so you know!)","Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and {that} there be no divisions among you; but {that} ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. {divisions: Gr. schisms}"
1 Corinthians,11,11,"So, like, word has spread to me through my homies from Chloe's squad, that y'all be having some serious drama going on among you.","For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them {which are of the house} of Chloe, that there are contentions among you."
1 Corinthians,11,12,"So, like, I gotta say this, you know? Every one of you is like, claiming 'I'm all about Paul,' or 'I follow Apollos,' or 'I'm team Cephas,' or even 'I'm all in for Christ, y'all.'","Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ."
1 Corinthians,11,13,"Yo, is Christ like, split into different factions? Did Paul get crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?",Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
1 Corinthians,11,14,"Bruh, I'm so relieved that I didn't baptize any of y'all except for Crispus and Gaius. Like, seriously though.","I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;"
1 Corinthians,11,15,Just in case anyone starts saying that I baptized people thinking I'm some kind of big shot.,Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
1 Corinthians,11,16,"Oh, by the way, I totally baptized Stephanas' whole crew, but honestly, I can't remember if there were any others that I baptized. 🌊","And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other."
1 Corinthians,11,17,"So basically, Jesus didn't send me to baptize people, but to spread the good news and share the gospel. And let me tell you, it's not about using fancy words or sounding super smart, because that would take away the power of the message behind the cross of Christ. You feel me?","For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. {words: or, speech}"
1 Corinthians,11,18,"Like, to those who are like, totally lost, the message of the cross may seem so, like, dumb or whatever. But to us who are like, saved and stuff, it's all about God's ultimate power, you know?",For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
1 Corinthians,11,19,"Like, the scripture says, I'm gonna totally wreck the knowledge of all those smarty-pants and make the understanding of the clever ones completely useless.","For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
1 Corinthians,11,20,"Like, where are all the smart ones at? Or the ones who know how to write really well? Or those who love to argue and stuff? Seriously, God totally made the wisdom of this world look dumb. Can't even handle it.",Where {is} the wise? where {is} the scribe? where {is} the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
1 Corinthians,11,21,"Like, back in the day, God was all like, super wise and stuff, but the world, like, didn't even get it, you know? So, like, God decided to do something totally unexpected and save those who have faith by, get this, preaching, which everyone thought was kinda foolish. But hey, who's laughing now?","For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe."
1 Corinthians,11,22,The Jews are all about looking for signs and the Greeks are all about wisdom:,"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:"
1 Corinthians,11,23,"Yo, we out here spreading the word about Jesus getting nailed on the cross. Some peeps, especially the Jews, trip over it; they just can't vibe with it. And then there's the Greeks, they straight up think it's all nonsense.","But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;"
1 Corinthians,11,24,"But for those who are invited, whether they're Jews or Greeks, Christ is the ultimate power move from God, packing both the strength and the smarts.","But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
1 Corinthians,11,25,"Yo, peeps, listen up! God's foolishness is actually wayyy smarter than us humans, and His weakness is like, super powered compared to our strength.",Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
1 Corinthians,11,26,"Yo, guys, check it out. You see how not a whole lot of smart or powerful or rich folks are the ones getting called here, right?","For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, {are called}:"
1 Corinthians,11,27,"Like, God totally chooses the stuff that seems dumb in the world to totally surprise the so-called smart ones, and He picks the stuff that seems weak to totally shock the powerful ones, you know?",But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
1 Corinthians,11,28,"Yo, check this out - God straight up picked the lowly and despised things of the world. And get this, even stuff that doesn't really exist, He chose to overthrow the things that do exist.","And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, {yea}, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:"
1 Corinthians,11,29,"So, like, nobody should be all like boasting or showing off when they're around Him.",That no flesh should glory in his presence.
1 Corinthians,11,30,"But like, in Christ Jesus, God made him, like, our source of wisdom, righteousness, holiness, and redemption, you know?","But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:"
1 Corinthians,11,31,"So, like it says, if you're flexing, flex on the Lord.","That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."

2 Corinthians,11,3,"God is lit, yo! He's like the ultimate dad to Jesus and the real OG of mercy and comfort, fam.","Blessed {be} God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;"
2 Corinthians,11,4,"God's got our back when life gets tough, so we can be there for others when they go through hardships, using the same comfort we've received from God.","Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God."
2 Corinthians,11,5,"Just like how Christ went through a ton of suffering, we also get a whole lot of comfort from Him.","For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ."
2 Corinthians,11,6,"And whether we go through tough times, it's for your comfort and salvation, which becomes powerful when we endure the same sufferings that we also go through. Or whether we find comfort, it's for your comfort and salvation.","And whether we be afflicted, {it is} for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, {it is} for your consolation and salvation. {is effectual: or, is wrought}"
2 Corinthians,11,7,"And we believe in you, knowing that just as you share in the difficult times, you will also experience comfort.","And our hope of you {is} stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so {shall ye be} also of the consolation."
